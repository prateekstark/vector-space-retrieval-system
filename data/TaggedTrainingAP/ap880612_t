<HEAD>Army Called In To Help Control Blaze; Damage Estimated At $90

 A fire in the country's largest shopping center burned for a second day Sunday with losses rising to $ 90 million and the army ordered to help control the blaze Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Imbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, armed forces minister, ordered soldiers to join the firemen immediately after visiting the Plaza <LOCATION> Naco </LOCATION> shopping center, located in the capital's upper class <LOCATION> Naco </LOCATION> district, Saturday evening. The police also helped firemen keep the blaze from spreading to neighboring buildings. Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> Buenaventura </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said Sunday that the fire was under control, but that the dense smoke and lack of water and equipment such as oxygen masks and protective clothing hindered firemen's efforts. Some firemen fainted and suffered cuts and bruises, but no other injuries were reported. The fire, one of the largest recorded in this nation of 6.5 million, began early Saturday morning and destroyed most of the more than 100 shops, movie theaters, offices, banks and restaurants in the mall. Firemen said the blaze was caused by faulty wiring in an auxiliary power plant turned on during a power failure. Shopping center administrators and shop owners estimated damage at about $ 90 million.

 <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> closed her eyes and shuddered as she relived the moment. The 80-year-old widow owed $ 103.44 on her water bill, and city utility truck No. 986 had just arrived at her small, white stucco bungalow to cut off the water. Doing without water would be hard enough for a frail old woman in the suffocating subtropical heat and humidity of south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> also cares for a granddaughter who has lost her left leg to diabetes and must undergo kidney dialysis three times a week. `` I tried to explain that somebody had stolen my Social Security check and that I'd pay the bill as soon as my next check came in,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> told a visiting reporter. `` They told me they were only doing their job. `` It was plain to see those boys did n't want to do it. They said they were real sorry, but it was still awful to watch them drive away and know our water had been cut off.'' But what the crew did next has made the four men local heroes and brought in donations that should make Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> secure for a long time: they drove back, turned the water on and scraped up enough cash to pay her bill. `` When the word got out about what happened, a local plumbing contractor volunteered to pay Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON>'s water bill for a year. Another local company is paying her electric bills,'' said <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who supervises city water department crews. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and the three members of the city's celebrated utility crew _ <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> _ visited Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> one recent steamy afternoon. They stopped by to say hello and see how she was faring. `` These are my friends,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> said, giving <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> a hug. `` These fellows are my heroes, they're the ones who started the wheels turning for me.'' The wheels began turning Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON>'s way almost immediately after the utility truck pulled away from the curb in front of her house on April 14. `` We decided we just could n't leave her like that,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` It was the middle of the month, and that meant it would be more than two weeks before the old lady's next check would arrive. It was plain that she and her granddaughter really needed help.'' Cutting off water service in such a climate makes people desperate, the crew members said. `` Some of them get real nasty and threaten to shoot you or sic their dogs on you,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` Others get down and beg you not to do it, which only makes it worse.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> had merely asked for enough time to fill her bathtub and a few pots and pans with water before service was shut off. `` It really touched me,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. So the crew members called their office on the truck radio and found out how much Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> owed. Then they began pulling money out of their pockets. `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and I each put up $ 15 and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargrett </PERSON>, our foreman, pitched in $ 20,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` Some other fellows at the office also contributed a few dollars, and <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> put up the remaining $ 33.44.'' <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> put in a dollar. `` But that was every penny he had,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` It was a gift from his heart.'' News media soon picked up the story. `` Since then we've gotten dozens of calls and letters from all over the place,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` People from as far away as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have sent money and checks for Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON>; a local guy even stopped by and gave us a check for the $ 103.44 we had put up.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he has turned over all the contributions, including the $ 103.44 check, to Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON>'s church, where a fund has been set up for her. `` So far, we've received more than $ 700,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sample </PERSON>, pastor of the Mt. <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said recently. `` We'll use the money to help her pay her bills. Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON> lost her husband, <PERSON> Izell </PERSON>, a year ago, and she and her granddaughter, <PERSON> Mercideen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, 37, live on a monthly income of $ 952. Mrs. <PERSON> Shefton </PERSON>, a former domestic worker who cleaned the homes of <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>'s more affluent families for 40 years, said she does n't know what to make of all the help and support she has received. `` It's wonderful, but do n't forget that it all started with these boys here,'' she said, pointing to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` We were happy to do it,'' replied <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, who said he, too, is somewhat flabbergasted by all the attention, including letters of commendation from the mayor. `` We did n't have no idea it would turn out like this,'' he said. `` We were just trying to help a nice old lady out of a jam.''

 At the end, she was alone, hiding from the world she'd shattered that day in wild gunfire. Outside, the tears and trauma had just begun. Inside, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> shot one last time and her torment was over. No one saw her place the .32 - caliber revolver in her mouth or heard the shot that destroyed her demons and ended a day of Three weeks after she killed a young boy at <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and ended her life in the house where she had held police at bay, authorities are still trying to piece together the puzzle of <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s life. `` We want to answer the question why,'' said <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON>. `` What made it happen? How did it happen? We owe that to the citizens and the community. We owe it to the families of victims. If you put yourself in their spot, you'd want to know why. `` It's very possible she may have taken that to the grave with her,'' he added. `` We can hopefully come down with a position of ` This is probably why.' <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s road to tragedy was lined with signs of trouble ahead, most posted in the last two years. In that time, she was divorced, forced out of an apartment and charged with shoplifting. She lied about her name, age and occupation; she claimed to be a teacher or a journalism student. She was suspected of making hundreds of harassing hang-up or threatening phone calls to her ex-husband, his family and others. She was charged once, but the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence. Students and officials at two schools say she hid raw meat under seat cushions, wore knit gloves when she ate, ran her shower for hours and rode an elevator day and night in her dormitory where she was called `` psycho'' and `` elevator lady.'' `` She was definitely a very, very confused woman,'' <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. Dangerous, too, her ex-husband and others feared. But even as they were contacting the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, prosecutors and police, several <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION> families were unwittingly hiring <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> as a babysitter. Two days before the May 20 tragedy, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> prosecutors were ready to charge <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> with making threatening phone calls to a former boyfriend. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> authorities were working a similar case. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was closing in, too. They moved too late. By then, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> had killed 8-year-old <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON>. She shot five other children at the school and a 20-year-old man who tried to disarm her when she burst into his family's house. She barricaded herself there and committed suicide. `` I do n't see why this had to happen and get this far,'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, her former sister-in law, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> called her hundreds of times, saying things like `` ` <PERSON> Susie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susie </PERSON>, you are going to die.''' <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, police say, left behind a trail of poison: 31 packets of juice and other foods, 29 of them contaminated with arsenic or lead, sent to her ex-husband, psychiatrist, families she worked for, two <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fraternity houses and others. Police believe she may once have known someone at the frat houses but do n't know why she directed her poison at acquaintances, her gun at strangers. It was n't the only paradox in <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s life. Children she tended adored her, but adults came to fear her. She was raised in a world of wealth and elegant homes, but she left rotting meat behind in one apartment with urine-stained floors. Still, some say they detected no hint of growing fury. `` She really was a pleasant ... quiet person. ... She was n't this ghoulish person all her life,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Solber </PERSON>, one attorney who represented her in divorce proceedings `` She was n't the monster she turned out to be. For most of her 30 years, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> lived an unremarkable life. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>, who had an older brother, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, graduated from prestigious <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Her father, a successful accountant, and mother live in <LOCATION> Glencoe </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION>, where $ 500,000 mansions, private beaches along <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and three-car garages are not uncommon. In high school `` she was really quiet, kind of withdrawn. She held her head low,'' said ex-classmate <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiarelli </PERSON>. `` There was always kind of a wall in-between. ... She never really gave you eye contact. She was nervous when she talked to you.'' She took classes at four universities _ <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin-Madison </LOCATION> _ over six years. At <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, she majored in home economics but did not graduate after four years. Later, she took courses in acting, dance and playwriting. At <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> pledged <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Pi sorority, where sisters remembered her as introverted and recalled how she would make several dates for one night, then cancel all but one. `` I just perceived her to be a sweet little girl,'' <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimer </PERSON> <PERSON> Janes </PERSON>, a former chapter president, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>. For two years, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> dated a premed student at <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, who later claimed she harassed him with threatening phone calls. His identity has not been made public. However, the man's friend, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Spivack </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> prosecutor who double-dated with them, remembers <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> as `` aloof, perhaps a little unfriendly, possessive'' but exhibiting no especially strange behavior. In 1982, two years after returning to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, she married <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, who worked in his family's insurance firm. <PERSON> Solber </PERSON> said his client, who was 5-foot-3, described herself and her husband as both `` little and cute. -LRB- She said -RRB- they looked like brother and sister. That was her perception.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Danns </ORGANIZATION> bought a $ 275,000 home, but the marriage crumbled by 1986. She saw a psychiatrist for part of their marriage. Their parting was bitter. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, who had taken a marksmanship course in her college days, bought a .357 - caliber Magnum, saying she needed it for A worried <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> alerted police, who contacted her parents. <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> told officers the gun would be locked in a safety deposit box. The .357 was one of three guns she carried into the school. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> also accused her husband of assault, breaking into their home and setting it on fire, charges never substantiated. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, in turn, asserted she sneaked into his apartment as he slept Sept. 30, 1986, and stabbed him in the chest with an ice pick. He said he never saw his assailant and later claimed his ex-wife had admitted to the attack. But <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> failed a lie detector test and refused to take a second, while <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> passed, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney.

 Police found packaging for an ice pick in the house the <ORGANIZATION> Danns </ORGANIZATION> had shared, but <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said no fingerprints were on the pick itself. <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> also said reports indicated the doctor and nurse who treated <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> at the hospital noted the wound could have been self-inflicted. No charges were filed. `` There was just no case there,'' <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said. According to divorce records, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> was to receive a lump sum of $ 125,000 and $ 1,250 monthly for three years. After the shootings, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> appeared on `` Nightline'' at his request and phoned a radio talk show to urge tougher gun control. Since then, he has declined further comment. He did acknowledge to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, however, that `` some people think I was the bad guy.'' <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s life began unraveling faster and faster in 1986. That summer, she dated <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON>, whose mother, <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, lived near her parents. She was `` very pretty ... very preppy ... but very shy,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> said, and had unusual habits: she washed her hands often and touched things only with a napkin. She said her son `` noticed too many problems. ... She'd be very friendly, then it would be, ` Do n't touch me, do n't touch me.''' That fall, <PERSON> Spivack </PERSON> said his friend, now a doctor, began getting harassing calls he believed were from <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> _ six years after their breakup. <PERSON> Spivack </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> somehow obtained the doctor's unlisted number; the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said she knew where the doctor was working. <PERSON> Spivack </PERSON> said the calls stopped in 1987 after an attorney wrote a letter to her parents' home. Last summer, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s father intervened when <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> officials, reacting to repeated harassment complaints, including reports she left raw meat under lounge cushions, moved to evict her. She left the graduate student apartment she was subletting. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> then posted notices in local groceries, seeking babysitting jobs. Many families said she had a terrific rapport with children, but <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> twice made restitution to employer families after his daughter was suspected of stealing food or clothes, police say. In January, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> moved to The Towers in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, a dormitory one block off the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> campus. Most residents were freshmen, more than a decade younger than <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>. Her suitemate said <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> told her she was a journalism student from Northwestern, but she never carried books or attended classes. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> explained to dorm neighbors she wore gloves when she ate because she was allergic or sensitive to metal objects. The suitemate, who asked not to be identified, said after several incidents she became uncomfortable and moved out. Other residents say <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> avoided sidewalk cracks, watched TV all day and rode the elevators for hours, carrying a note pad. Student <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Soifer </PERSON> said he heard she wept once when some guys teased her on the elevator. `` Everybody told stories about her,'' he said. `` She must have known people were pointing at her and talking about her.'' `` She just looked like she was lost,'' said resident <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzinberg </PERSON>. Amid mounting harassment complaints, meanwhile, the investigations continued. <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> said December phone records showed that 55 pre-dawn calls lasting a minute or less were made in 4 -LCB- hours from the <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> home. In March, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> reportedly stopped seeing her psychiatrist, who had prescribed lithium carbonate to treat depression. She was also taking an experimental drug called clomipramine, used for obsessive-compulsive disorders. That month, a woman who had known the <ORGANIZATION> Danns </ORGANIZATION> when they were married and had received hundreds of hang-up calls since 1986 picked up her phone to hear: ` You are going to die.' The woman, who asked that her name not be used, suspected <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> in all the calls. On March 14, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, accused of stealing four wigs and other items, said Capt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> initially gave police a fake name and a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> address. Once she gave her real name, she still gave phony information on her student status and address, he said. On May 9, <PERSON> Spivack </PERSON> said his friend answered the phone and heard a female voice say `` she would come out and stab them and make it look like his wife had done it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was given a tape-recording of the call. The night of May 15, <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> was found in a dormitory trash room curled in a fetal position, wrapped in a plastic bag and dripping with sweat. When police arrived, however, she was asleep in her room. Aware of the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was called. They arrived the next morning. She was gone. After the shooting, police searched her belongings and found a picture of her with her ex-husband, scraps of paper with names, rough drafts of threatening notes to the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> doctor, supportive letters from her parents, four catalog cards from a library referring to books on poisoning, a list of words including `` schools'' and `` both,'' and a white smock she apparently took from a hospital where she'd been treated as an outpatient, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> in Madison. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> was suspected of stealing arsenic and other chemicals from a hospital lab in March. Plans in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> to seek an indictment May 18 were delayed to coordinate legal action with other states. Two days later, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, wearing a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> shirt with a skeleton on it, reached the end of her road to tragedy. `` I feel very frustrated,'' <PERSON> Spivack </PERSON> said. `` We were within a few days of averting this. We ran out of time.''

 Inside the beltway that circles <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is the target of a barrage of charges of ethical misconduct. But inside Loop 820 that circles <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, his home district, it's business as usual. Aides in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> office are n't hearing complaints about the congressman, they say, just the usual requests from constituents seeking help with Social Security checks or a passport. And local <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders say the charges alone wo n't hurt the powerful Democrat. `` Where there's a lot of smoke you ought to at least look for the fire, but I do n't think the smoke is going to cause him problems,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman in <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said the ethics investigation `` may plow him under, or vindicate him and make him a hero.'' The House Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Friday to investigate charges lodged by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s political enemy, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., and <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that monitors government ethics They allege that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> lobbied on behalf of oil interests in a case in which he had a financial stake, that he received unusually high royalties for a book he wrote that was published in 1985 by a longtime associate and campaign contractor, that he used a Capitol Hill staffer and office funds to help draft the book, and that he used a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> condominium, owned by the family of a business partner, without having to pay a monthly rent. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, who directs <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s district office, said Thursday the office has received 12 telephone calls in the past two weeks concerning the salvo of charges fired <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. Of those 12, two were negative, while the rest were encouraging, similar to comments <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said he received while making rounds in the conservative 12th District that stretches over the northern two-thirds of <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The district, about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, is known for its rowdy frontier image, exemplified by its Fort Worth Stockyards tourist attraction. But the city's collar has whitened with high-technology industries such as <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, Bell Helicopter and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. Local Democrats say their Republican counterparts have little to complain about because <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been an effective congressman for the district. Since his arrival in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1955, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been a prodigious provider of federal dollars for <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, especially in the form of defense contracts, and he has one of the most politically safe districts in the nation. He faces no Republican opponent in the November election. `` He is a supporter of his friends, even his Republican friends,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Barron </PERSON>, a longtime <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Democrat. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and other Democrats say the charges are part of a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plot to embarrass <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and the party before the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> next month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and to take pressure off Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been named chairman of the convention. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said that when he was eating at a restaurant a man approached him and said: `` They're picking on that boy of ours up there, are n't they? You tell them to leave him alone.'' Recently, constituent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> office to see if the staff could help him find a certain kind of government stamp for his son's stamp collection. <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON>, 39, said the ethics charges do n't bother him. `` I read the newspapers every day, but the fact is I do n't think we could have a better person up there. He's done a lot for the area,'' he said. <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> dismissed the ethics charges as based on politics. `` Every four years someone up there has to start slinging mud,'' he said.

<HEAD>Vermont First In Nation To Enact Subsidy For Farmers</HEAD>

 On a small dairy farm tucked under the Canadian border, the `` For Sale'' sign has come down. Vermonters, worried that the small farmer might become an endangered species, hope it is the beginning of a trend. What prompted <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> to change his mind and stay on his 100-cow farm was the promise of $ 5,000 cash this year from the state. Most of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s 2,700 farmers are eligible for the subsidy under the first such program ever enacted by a state. Farmers have until Wednesday to apply; a maximum of $ 5,000 will be paid each farmer. The subsidy was born out of fear that the farms that play such a large role in the heritage of one of the nation's most rural states would soon vanish from the landscape. The fear was well-founded: 10 percent of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s 3,000 farms went out of business in the past two years. `` It's viewed as being rather revolutionary,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Allbee </PERSON> of the new program. `` It's viewed as, ` I ca n't believe <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> did it.' `` I think this is a ray of sunlight to all the dairy farmers in the state of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissette </PERSON> of <PERSON> East </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, the first to sign up for the subsidy. The problem facing dairy farmers was simple: The price of milk was falling; costs were rising. Between 1981 and 1987, the price farmers received for their milk declined, in real dollars, from $ 13.90 to $ 12.43 per hundred pounds of milk. More than 40 percent of the farms in the state were operating below the break-even point. The culprit was a federal policy designed to reduce a milk surplus in the West. The policy, farmers said, was ruining dairy farms in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where there was a shortage of milk. As 1988 began, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> farmers endured another reduction in the federal price support, the price the federal ensures farmers for their milk, and faced the prospect of more cuts. The state decided to step in. At first Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> opposed the one-year $ 7.5 million program as bad fiscal policy that would n't give farmers the long-term help they needed. But lawmakers and citizens groups _ seeing state coffers overflowing from a strong economy _ rallied around the subsidy, concerned that the loss of farmers and farmland would change the face of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and remove land treasured for hunting, fishing, trapping and sightseeing. `` They're the custodians of the countryside,'' state Sen. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Howrigan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said of the farmers. The subsidy program will pay farmers 50 cents for every hundred pounds of milk they produce up to 1 million pounds, which is more than the average farm produces. It's available to farmers who receive at least half their gross income from farming, make less than $ 32,000 a year, and belong to a milk cooperative or an 11-state dairy cartel that's trying to win a higher milk price for Northeast farmers. The program faces a legal challenge from a group of farmers who say the program discriminates against those few who do not belong to co-ops. The Legislature this year also enacted some long-term help for farmers that will give them big breaks on their property taxes in future years. The state will pay up to approximately 90 percent of farmers' local property taxes if they agree to continue farming. The tax program covers all non-dairy farmers this year; next year, when the dairy subsidy is eliminated, it will apply to dairy farmers. But lawmakers and farmers say the state can not afford to continue its $ 7.5 million subsidy and that the true solution can come only from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's the finger in a dike that is getting an ever-wider fissure,'' said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` I think we're in a dire situation, and I do n't think the state of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> has the resources to carry that farmer for a long period of time.'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> expects to triple the value of his $ 5,000 payment from the state by using it to grow feed, one of his rapidly rising expenses. `` It's going to make a difference, and it gives you a chance,'' he said, surveying the corn field that lies in the shadow of <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Peak </PERSON>, a popular ski area. `` It may turn around.''

 <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> is off to see the Munchkins, the wonderful Munchkins of Oz. But he has no Yellow Brick Road to follow in his search for the little people who greeted <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> in the 1939 film `` The Wizard of Oz.'' `` It may not be easy to find some of them,'' said the writer. `` I know there are some still living, but they've sort of fallen into the woodwork.'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> is writing a book about the little people who sang and danced with the young <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> in the musical based on <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s magical tale of good and bad witches, a bumbling wizard and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s lovable friends, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s book, `` Oz Remembered: Memoirs of the Munchkins,'' will be published by E.P. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and released next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the MGM movie classic. `` There are hundreds of thousands of people out there who are fascinated by the Munchkins,'' said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinet </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> editor. So far, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> has located about 30 of the 124 people who played <LOCATION> Munchkinland </LOCATION> villagers and soldiers. He has spent days poring over telephone directories and making calls with not much to go on but old address books and faded sign-in sheets from long-ago lunches on the movie's set. `` I figure it's about time to give them some credit,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that the movie credits gave them little mention. `` All it said was ` The Singer Midgets as the Munchkins.' Their scene lasts about 10 minutes, but I think it's the most enchanting part of the whole movie.'' For <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON>, being a Munchkin meant a chance to meet movie stars and other people of her size. She was 16 when the movie was made and is nearing 70 now, she said recently from her home in <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` Meeting up with all the little people, because I had n't been around very many little people _ it was just a great experience.'' `` I did n't think it would be so popular. Of course, I was excited about it and I was thinking, ` Oh boy, I'm going to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>.''' `` A lot of the Munchkins think: A book on the Munchkins? Is that really going to sell?'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. `` They do n't realize how popular they are.'' Most of the men and women who played the Munchkins were recruited by two troupes of vaudeville midgets headed by <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>. But many of them had never acted before and some were from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and did n't speak English, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. A few of them went on in show business, but most eventually settled into other jobs, he said. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, now 69, continued acting for a time, then returned home to the family business selling grave monuments. <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubin </PERSON> opened a tavern in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> Midget </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and walked along the bar serving drinks. <PERSON> Meinhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> went on to portray Little Oscar for <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> lunchmeats and made promotional appearances around the country. They're all proud of their parts in `` The Wizard of Oz,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They're proud of being a part of one of the best motion pictures ever made. A new generation discovers ` The Wizard of Oz' every year. But for all the fond memories of working with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and the other stars, there were problems, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON> recalled heavy, elaborate costumes and layers of makeup. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Croft </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, remembered how it smarted when the plastic `` skin'' that made the men look bald was ripped off like a piece of tape at the end of each day. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he has heard a story about one Munchkin _ an actor nicknamed `` The Count'' and well-known for his drinking _ who visited the bathroom one day and wound up falling into the toilet and being stuck there for 45 minutes. `` Some of the little people are telling tall tales,'' he said. `` But some of it's good for legends.''

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has a $ 900 million problem, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s is $ 2 billion and Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' just grew to more than $ 400 million in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. State budget deficits are sweeping the nation as a result of what almost everyone thought was a good idea _ federal tax reform that has resulted in a slump in capital gains tax collections. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> announced last week that he would have to pare as much as $ 60 million from his budget proposal because of a one-shot `` revenue slump'' brought on by lower-than-expected tax collections. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> budget chief <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Milano </PERSON> warned state agencies last week that sluggish revenue collections could mean the state will start its new fiscal year July 1 with a deficit. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, state officials say that total revenues are up but that taxes on sales of personal investments, also known as capital gains, are down about 8 percent. There are indications that other states that rely heavily on personal income taxes for revenue may have similar problems as the year goes on, said <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s budget director. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has even proposed cutting funding for the state's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION>, which is run by his wife, <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON>. Most states reaped tax revenue windfalls from 1986 when investors rushed to take advantage of tax breaks that the new federal rules were designed to erase when they took effect Jan. 1, 1987. Then the tax changes sent taxpayers running to their accountants for help in reducing their taxes, and the taking of capital gains slowed, reducing capital gains tax revenues. In some states, such as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, budget officials lowered their revenue estimates forthis year in anticipation of a possible shortfall. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Chamber of Business and Industry complained that Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s administration was not liberal enough in estimating the benefits of federal tax reform. `` We had a discussion with the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Chamber on how much of a windfall we would get and we said, ` None,''' said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s deputy secretary for policy and analysis. `` That's what we budgeted for and that's what's happening.'' The fiscal problems are causing political headaches for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, based his campaign on his abilities as a manager. He must now cut his budget because his numbers were wrong. Republican <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, who has been mentioned as a possible running mate for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, had proposed $ 800 million in revenue raisers to help close his budget gap, estimated at about $ 1 billion this year and $ 1 billion next year. But he withdrew the proposal, angry at reporters for calling it a tax increase. Democrat <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> does n't have to run for re-election until 1990 and has been quick to propose some politically unpopular spending cuts. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said last week that the shortfall could present a good lesson for this year's presidential campaign by demonstrating the different approaches for dealing with it. `` The deficit he has is just the right size,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I think this is a break for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He will now show you how he handles a deficit. He will do it swiftly, cleanly, effectively.'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' Democrat-controlled Legislature has tentatively passed a $ 40 million cigarette tax hike and a revision of state tax law to conform it to federal law that would increase personal income taxes by $ 70 million this year. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not yet committed to the cigarette tax. There have also been cursory discussions of other `` sin taxes'' on liquor and entertainment to close <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' $ 400 million shortfall. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> already has ordered that $ 233 million in spending be postponed, that state employment be frozen and that agencies prepare for possible personnel cuts through attrition. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' total budget is about $ 11 billion. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> last week proposed $ 406 million in program cuts and cost-savings from the $ 44.2 billion-plus budget the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> adopted less than two months ago. He also wants to make use of a $ 650 million fund that, ironically, was created with the 1986 tax windfall and set aside for low-income housing and highway projects. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has, among other things, ordered a hiring freeze for state agencies and proposed increasing tuition for out-of-state students at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s public colleges. He's called for the elimination of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>'s six-horse mounted patrol, a favorite at fairs throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has refused to call for tax increases or even a delay of tax cuts enacted last year, even though at the time he suggested the cuts might be too generous.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Claim Victories as 10th Rainy Season Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist guerrillas fighting in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> said in a broadcast available Sunday that they killed or wounded nearly 3,000 Vietnamese soldiers during May. The claim contradicted earlier pronouncements by <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, which said fighting had died down and it could therefore begin withdrawing troops. The clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio said 2,821 Vietnamese soldiers had been killed or wounded during the first month of the 10th rainy season of the war. It said <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s administrative networks had been dismantled in 537 villages, 11 communes and one township. Past rainy seasons have usually favored the guerrillas, who are fighting the mechanized, conventional forces <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has maintained in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since its late 1978 invasion. `` They lack both fighting forces and food supplies, and their aggressor soldiers are increasingly demoralized,'' said the broadcast, made available in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` In sum, the Vietnamese have failed and are a complete impasse.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, however, has announced that a greatly improved security situation in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> would allow it to pull 50,000 troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> over the next seven months. The partial withdrawal may begin late this month. Western analysts, who are generally skeptical of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> claims, say there has been a sharp drop in fighting in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in recent months. They speculated that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other guerrilla groups may be stockpiling weapons and positioning themselves for a big push when <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s forces are scaled down. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, ousted from power by the Vietnamese, are allied to two non-communist groups in a loose coalition.

 <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> state troopers and social workers Saturday were still seeking dozens of youngsters who fled a Baptist boarding school moments before authorities investigating allegations of abuse could take them into state custody. Sixty-four residents of the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children in <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>, about 100 miles to the southeast, were taken to the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> here. Most arrived Friday night, while others arrived at the psychiatric hospital Saturday. Some of the children, ages 8 through 17, were found in private homes, restaurants and along the streets of <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>. Most of the 120 to 160 students at the school had fled Friday before state social workers arrived to carry out a court order assigning the state temporary custody of the children. The whereabouts of the remaining children was not known Saturday, and state welfare officials said they might be in hiding. The home's operator, The Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, said Saturday he is sheltering four or five youngsters who fled. He also said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION> that he had taken a new teen-age boy into the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION> on Saturday and would continue to take any children dropped off by parents, the <ORGANIZATION> Biloxi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. `` I've still got a few soldiers left, and I'm trying to work back to what it was before,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. The judge who issued the order said there was reason to suspect physical and mental abuse of students. Complaints by former residents of the home ranged from severe beatings to forced labor. Some children received excessive corporal punishment and no medical care and were harassed by other children at the home, state Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said Saturday. As to any new residents taken in by Fountain, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said the state would await orders from the judge, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said he would n't indicate how he'll deal with the development until Monday, when a court hearing is scheduled in the case. Fountain, 38, said in the interview that he became a minister after God saved him from heroin addiction in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1972 and that he opened the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for children in 1979. He denied telling the children to run away from the home when welfare officials arrived. `` The children are in here mainly for runaways, stealing, homosexuality. We have little girls who are whores,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said, adding that strict discipline is required for such youths. `` The parents have lost control. Kids today are such manipulators. Such cons. Especially a child from a divorce. They've learned how to manipulate their parents,'' he said By Saturday evening, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he had released 10 children to their parents. He said he expected to keep interviewing parents Saturday and Sunday; by Monday, he said he hoped to arrange the return of almost all the children. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 16, was among the students who screamed angrily at <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers and state troopers when they arrived Friday. `` You have no right,'' he yelled. `` I want to be here with my people. I do n't want to be with all the rest of you people who hate the truth. You better check yourself and make sure you are not burning on the way to hell.'' The home is on the grounds of <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which is not affiliated with any formal group. Authorities are not sure how many students were at the home because they have not seen its records and were not been able to contact Fountain since Friday, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. The missing children might have been moved secretly to another location by Fountain, he said. `` We have a suspicion in that direction, but do n't like to make a confirmation one way or another until we are sure,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he had met with parents or more than a dozen children but did not return children to some who refused to answer questions. `` We indicated to them that until they did, they had better make some other arrangements for their children,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. State officials said they hoped that the children would be released to their parents or guardians as soon as possible. Officials telephoned parents and guardians and set up a special line for them. Hospital officials reported handling calls from parents as far away as <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` We started getting calls just after lunch -LRB- Friday -RRB-,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Wynona </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON>. `` Yes, you can say it's been busy. Busy, busy.'' <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> ruled Friday afternoon that he was turning over custody of the residents to the state. The independent Baptist boarding school has come under fire several times since 1980. A physician testified during a hearing into the welfare of one child who ran away from the home that during a 19-month stay at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> the child did not receive medical treatment for an eye condition that could have left him blind. Doctors at the state hospital helped conduct medical examinations of the children but would not comment on their condition, <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON> said. A court hearing is set for Monday in the case. The state hospital was chosen to house the children because of readily available living space, food services, recreational facilities and medical and crisis intervention services, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said. The children will have no contact with patients, officials said. Boys slept Friday night on mattresses in the gymnasium, while the girls stayed in a vacant dormitory. Minutes after <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> issued his order at 11 a.m. Friday, state <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel arrived at the home. The youths apparently were alerted about the court order and most had fled. `` I did n't tell those kids to run,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said Friday. Fountain had been jailed for two days for refusing to give officials a list of residents. He was released Friday without providing the information when he agreed to an orderly transfer of the children to state custody. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he did n't know what action, if any, would be taken against Fountain.

 Opponents of a law that made Islam the state religion closed stores and halted traffic in the capital Sunday as they began an eight-hour nationwide strike. However, the monsoon rain kept police and protesters out of the streets of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. The country's mainstream opposition called the strike to condemn the law passed Tuesday by the 300-seat <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and signed into law by President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. Foes of the law had led torchlight parades through <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Saturday. The government tightened security in the capital and other cities in preparation for the strike Sunday. Riot police in trucks followed several small protest parades Saturday evening, but did not interfere. Among those who called the eight-hour general strike are three major opposition political alliances. At least 30 people have been injured and 35 vehicles damaged in repeated clashes with police since Parliament approved the bill. `` We have several thousand police on constant duty in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> and elsewhere. We are going to deploy more for tomorrow,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> attacked those organizing the strike. `` They have called this hartal -LRB- strike -RRB- against <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>, his prophet and his religion,'' <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> told Moslems at a <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> mosque after Friday prayers. He denied charges that the bill was aimed at perpetuating his rule, which began with a bloodless coup by the former army general in 1982. `` None can rule unless Allah wishes it,'' <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said. The measure amends the nation's constitution by inserting the sentence: `` The religion of the republic is Islam, but other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony.'' Opponents of the bill, mostly opposition politicians, women, students and members of the minority <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hindu </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> religions, say they fear it will lead to imposition of harsh Islamic rule based on the Koran. More than 85 percent of the country's 105 million people are Moslems. But the government denies it plans to change the nation's British-based civil law

 Hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican firefighters on Sunday battled fires that burned thousands of acres of brush and timber on both sides of the border and raced across an Apache Indian reservation, officials said. A forest fire that started in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> charred 6,000 acres, about 3,500 on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side of the border near <LOCATION> Nicksville </LOCATION>, and damaged two structures in a park picnic area, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. The blaze, which <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> called `` a raging monster out of control,'' also had threatened ranch homes in the <ORGANIZATION> Coronado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION>, about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, before they were saved by crews who started backfires. Nearly 200 miles north, a second fire that was sparked by lightning Friday in logging slash on a reservation near <LOCATION> Cibecue </LOCATION> had covered more than 500 acres of timber and brush by early Sunday, <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said. South of the border, the largest fire _ more than 10,000 acres _ had been burning for more than a week in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pinta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said. Four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forest officials crossed the border to serve as advisers in fighting the blaze. The fire near <LOCATION> Nicksville </LOCATION> was burning mostly on state and federal land in the national monument and the <ORGANIZATION> Coronado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> at elevations above 7,000 feet, he said. Authorities were unsure what started the blaze. The blaze damaged a restroom and a ramada, the Western version of a gazebo, in a picnic area within the national monument area, <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said.

 Police fired tear gas to drive back students who tried to storm the government party's headquarters Sunday during the funeral of a radical who committed ritual suicide. Hundreds of riot police firing volleys of tear gas pushed back waves of charging students who sought to reach the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The screaming students hurled hundreds of firebombs, and streets were covered with blazing gasoline as running clashes flared across the center of the city. `` Down with the military fascists,'' radical students yelled, and they hurled rocks and firebombs at police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s main shopping district. Protesters destroyed a police truck with firebombs. But riot police quickly pushed protesters back and chased them through the city for several miles. Radicals hurled rocks at the Japanese Embassy's information office and smashed windows. The fighting broke out during a funeral procession by about 10,000 radical students and sympathizers for Park Rae-chun, who died Monday after setting fire to himself in an anti-government protest. It was the third ritual suicide by a radical student since May 15. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been hit by a wave of violent radical student protests during the past month.

 A DC-9 jetliner carrying at least 21 people crashed Sunday while trying to land at a fogbound airport in northeastern <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, authorities said. There were no immediate reports of survivors. According to the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION>, at least 15 passengers and a crew of six were on board the Austral airlines jet, which left <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>' airport at 7 a.m. and stopped at the northern river port of <LOCATION> Resistencia </LOCATION>. Local news and radio reports said the plane then headed north and crashed at 9:50 a.m. into a plantation three miles short of the Posadas airport while trying to land there in heavy fog. Posadas, the capital of <LOCATION> Misiones </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, is 700 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and across the <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from the Paraguayan city of <LOCATION> Encarnacion </LOCATION>. There were unconfirmed reports the jetliner was on fire moments before it crashed. Firefighters who rushed to the scene in the semi-tropical north of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> said it appeared unlikely there were any survivors, <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> said. Austral is a private carrier purchased last year from the state that competes with the government carrier <ORGANIZATION> Aerolineas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> on domestic routes across <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the world's eighth-largest country geographically.

<HEAD>Summit Impact on Nicaragua: Zero</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The recent Soviet-American summit, widely seen as dealing a telling blow to the Cold War, appears to have had no impact on the continuing struggle between the two countries over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Just a week after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> bade a warm farewell to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, peace talks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> broke down and once again there is talk of renewing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contra rebels. Although the administration has made no decisions, officials seem to be laying the groundwork for a new aid request now that the negotiations between the Soviet-backed <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contras have collapsed, at least for the time being. The experience at the summit suggests <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are able to move ahead on such issues as arms control, human rights and bilateral issues, but mutual suspicions continue to run high in the so-called `` low intensity conflicts'' in the Third World. Such conflicts continue in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> acknowledged in an interview Friday that whatever progress <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have made on other issues during their summit meetings, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> remain unchanged. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has not shown any restraint in shipment of arms to Sandinistas,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. Estimates of Soviet military deliveries to the Nicaraguan government range between $ 250 million and $ 500 million since five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents signed a regional peace plan 10 months ago, he said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> rejected out of hand a Soviet proposal to end military deliveries to the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> provided the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> terminates such shipments to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He said this would make <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coequal in an area of vital interest to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and of no historic interest to the Kremlin If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ceases aiding its allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, `` how are they to resist Cuban subversion?'' he asked. The Kremlin view is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by aiding the Nicaraguan rebels starting just months after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981, bears the major responsibility for the death and destruction in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since then. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> had had little to say on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected on Feb. 3 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last request for military aid for the Contras. But after the peace talks broke down last Thursday, he sounded like his old combative self again, accusing the Sandinistas of engaging in bad faith. `` It's important to be clear on what happened,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. The rebels wanted the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to turn `` vague promises'' of democracy for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into a firm timetable. But the only firm timetable the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> wanted to discuss was the one in which the rebels would be required to turn in their arms as part of a final settlement, he said. `` When the time came for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to make serious commitments, it was over,'' he said. That view was not shared by Nicaraguan Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, head of the Sandinista delegation, who said Thursday the Contras held `` irrational positions'' and maintained an `` anti-negotiation attitude against the peace.'' As for the prospect for a new Contra aid request, the administration is expected to discuss that issue this coming week. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the main protagonists on past Contra aid votes already are staking out positions along familiar lines. `` I encourage the White House to move now ... and send up an aid package for a vote before the July recess,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> Said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, R-Mich., `` This is no time to be talking of military aid.

 For a month, the telephones in the office of Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, have been tied up by members of an anti-pornography group who have been urged to phone him and keep calling `` till you get through.'' Constituents have been unable to reach <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker's staff has had to send a page to contact him and even an exasperated <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> has been kept from reaching his secretary when he's away from the office. About 10,000 calls and nearly 20,000 letters have arrived in a campaign orchestrated by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, which told its members that an anti-pornography bill would die in a subcommittee chaired by <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` Perhaps you believe that a congressional office looks like <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, with dozens of operators sitting before computer terminals, ready and able to take messages,'' the congressman wrote the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, the group's executive director, on May 23, complaining about the tactic, and calling it needless. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on crime, said the bill is very much alive, and will have a second hearing on Thursday. Any delays have been caused by the diversion of staffers from the bill to work on the letters and phone calls, he said. Callers to <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' office are now greeted by a recorded message from the seven-term congressman that is on two answering machines. The machines were paid for by members of <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' staff, who decided the crisis could not wait for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials to buy the devices. After advising callers on other matters to dial another number, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> tells those interested in the pornography bill: `` You can be certain that I and the other 200 sponsors of this important measure will do all we can to see that it becomes law in a timely fashion. `` Thank you for calling. There's no need to leave a message. Your call is being counted automatically.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said in the interview, and in letters to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues and <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, that the family association fed its members inaccurate information, including an allegation that pornographers are twisting arms of lawmakers to kill the bill. But the most inaccurate message, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said, is that the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 is dying in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee on crime. `` We're in the hearing process,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> demanded we abandon that process and pass the bill with no amendments.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said that some provisions in the bill raise `` sensitive First Amendment concerns.'' Noting the 11-year-old association's letter asks for donations, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said the money appeal may be the real message the group wants to convey. The legislation encompasses a number of recommendations from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Pornography. Some of its provisions would allow government seizure of money and property derived from violation of pornography and obscenity laws; use of wiretaps in obscenity investigations; prohibition of obscenity in cable television programming; and creation of a new crime of receiving or possessing obscenity with the intent to transfer. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> told his followers in early May that the legislation `` is about to die'' in <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' committee, and urged supporters, `` If his phone is busy, keep calling till you get through.'' The letter said pornographers are `` spending a lot of money, twisting a lot of arms and pressuring a lot of congressmen,'' and asked, `` If you can help defray these unexpected costs, I'd be grateful. You can use the enclosed envelope.'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said in an interview that he regrets the inconvenience suffered by <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' staff, but contended he only wrote the letter after the crime subcommittee staff refused to tell him about plans for the bill. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> replied that he doubted that allegation, since the staff fields such routine inquiries all the time. Asked what evidence he had that the bill would die in committee, <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said, `` I was told by a number of people who knew what they were talking about.'' Asked who they were he replied, `` No comment.'' He also declined to say how he knew pornographers were pressuring lawmakers. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> denied that the purpose of his letter was to raise money, commenting, `` It cost me $ 79,000 to send the letter. To date, we raised $ 42,000. If I'm going to raise funds by losing $ 37,000 I'm going to be out of business in a hurry. `` It was a two-page letter and there were three sentences of an apology, saying I've got expenses to meet.'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said the group had 330,000 supporters, a number based on the 170,000 ministers and 160,000 others who receive the group's publications The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said, is a group that `` promotes things that would enhance the family'' and has taken positions against pornography, abortion, and some broadcast entertainment shows.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said in remarks published Sunday that the government will not stand in the way of the expansion of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Of course we are n't making any attempts to encroach on the rights of the Catholic church,'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda. `` And likewise, we are not trying to encroach on the rights of Catholics living in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> make the comments Saturday during the celebration of Christianity's arrival 1,000 years ago in what is now the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The communist Soviet government is officially atheist. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s comments followed a question by Cardinal <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON> on the possibility of organizing <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches not only in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s Baltic republics, where a recognized church exists in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, but also in other parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where there are large <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> communities. <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s secretariat for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, is a member of the largest <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation ever to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He was among several foreign dignitaries in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the church millennium who were invited to a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting with <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said large <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> communities exist in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. Those republics have no fully recognized <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches, and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> wants the right to appoint bishops there, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. Pravda's report of <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON>' question, taken from a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch, omitted the cardinal's specific references to the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, reflecting the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s sensitivity on the issue <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches could be opened outside the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> states if local authorities agree. `` In the future, we will give the necessary attention to the wishes of Soviet Catholics regardless of where they live,'' the 78-year-old president was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Willebrands </PERSON> met Friday with clergy of the underground Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ordered absorbed into the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946. Ukrainian clerics say there are 3 million to 4 million Ukrainian Catholics in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said in a letter in April to Ukrainian Catholics that their church should be fully recognized. The state-supported Russian Orthodox Church bitterly opposes recognition of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, claiming it was formed only as a result of a forced split in the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the 16th century. The issue was discussed June 7-9 at an unofficial seminar on religious problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Over the weekend, religious activists released a resolution they adopted at the meeting that called for the Russian Orthodox Church to legalize the Ukrainian church and other underground churches. The leader of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Agostino </PERSON> <PERSON> Casaroli </PERSON>, met Sunday with <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharchev </PERSON>, head of the government's Council for Religious Affairs. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said they discussed `` different questions regarding the relations between the Catholic church and Soviet government,'' but he would not give details of the talk.

 Waves of students yelling `` Revolution!'' and hurling firebombs tried to storm the headquarters of the governing party Sunday during a funeral march for a radical who committed ritual suicide. Thousands of riot police firing volleys of tear gas fought off attacking students and pursued them in running clashes through the center of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Protesters showered police with exploding firebombs that covered streets with blazing gasoline. Hundreds of people out for walks choked and cried with pain when they were caught in clouds of stinging tear gas. `` Down with the military fascists!'' and `` Revolution of the masses!'' the radicals screamed as they broke up sidewalk paving stones to hurl at police. The violence began when 10,000 students and sympathizers marched through the city with the coffin of <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae-chun </PERSON>, who died June 6 after setting himself on fire. It was the third protest suicide by radical students since May 15. Marchers armed with firebombs, rocks and clubs tried to attack the headquarters of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during the march but were blocked by riot police in combat fatigues and black helmets. Protesters set fire to a police truck with firebombs and damaged the information office of the Japanese Embassy with rocks. A number of police and students were hurt and some protesters were arrested, but no figures were available. Police reported the first death from the unrest. A riot trooper died Sunday after being injured in fighting the day before in the central city of <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION>. The wave of student protests is the nation's worst political violence since anti-government riots in June 1987. But unlike last summer, where pro-democracy demonstrators enjoyed wide support from the masses, the radical students demonstrating now represent a small minority. Most South Koreans do not support their demands for reunification of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with the pro-Western South and the withdrawal from the South of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. Marchers shouted `` Yankee go home!'' on Sunday, but the protest was less anti-American than other recent demonstrations. Marchers yelled slogans as they passed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> building, but there were no incidents beyond one man hurling a soft-drink can. Students wore red headbands with anti-government slogans and beat drums and gongs as they marched through the city. The coffin, covered in yellow flowers, was carried by bearers in traditional white mourning clothes. The dead student belonged to a faction seeking creation of a revolutionary government. Marchers began arming themselves with firebombs from a truck loaded with the weapons as the procession continued after a rally in front of City Hall. Students wielding clubs, rocks and firebombs went to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters where riot police blocked the street. They attacked police, who fired volleys of tear gas. Armored vans with multiple tear gas launchers blasted protesters. Hundreds of riot police waiting in sidestreets poured out and quickly routed the attackers. Students at one point seized a highway overpass, but special police martial arts squads hurling tear gas grenades attacked and dispersed them. The protest was aimed mainly at the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Radical leaders denounced the government as a dictatorship and called for creation of a peoples' republic. `` We are here to fight for liberation of the masses,'' said one leader. The radical students have rejected democratic reforms made by the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government in recent months, insisting the government is a front for dictatorial military rule. They say the presence of the American troops, stationed here under a mutual defense pact, encourages military rule. Some people watching the march expressed bewilderment and anger. An elderly man, who yelled that students were not patriots, tried to attack marchers. `` Why do these young people do this? What does it say about our country,'' one middle-aged man said.

 A farmer lying in wait for a gang of robbers hurled a spear from his hideout and accidentally killed one of his two wives, police said Sunday. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikuku </PERSON> heard noises from where he hid outside his village of <LOCATION> Indangalaisa </LOCATION> on Friday night, thought it was a gang that had robbed his neighbors and tossed the spear, police said. His wife, <PERSON> Paustsina </PERSON> <PERSON> Nambutie </PERSON>, was hidden in some bushes nearby and was fatally wounded. Police said they were hunting the eight-man gang that had robbed four families in the village early that evening. <PERSON> Sikuku </PERSON>, fearing he might become a victim of the gang, woke his two wives and their children and told them to hide in a nearby cornfield, police said. He took cover armed with a spear. He realized he had killed his wife when he left his hideout to inspect the body of his victim, police said.

<TEXT>
 `` When I become president there are no more impossible dreams.'' It was a refrain <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeated often in his travels across the nation. He often seemed to marvel at how the illegitimate son of a poor black teen-ager had ended up the political toast of adoring crowds from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, protected by a pack of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and trailed by a busload of cameras and reporters. Even if he did n't become president, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his presidential campaign showed how far blacks had come since the days when they were relegated to the back of the bus. Nobody really knew how <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be received in his second Democratic presidential bid, and he angrily objected to the `` but he ca n't win'' tag that often followed his name in news reports. When the curtain fell on the primary season last Tuesday, he had collected nearly 7 million votes, some 29 percent of the total. That was more than double his 1984 total and a second place finish out of an original field of seven Democrats. He won the vote in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Some states where he won more than 20 percent of the vote had black populations of less than 1 percent, thus accomplishing one of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s key goals this year _ adding white votes to his core constituency of blacks. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delights in belittling the skeptics and pundits who speculated he could n't do that. On the campaign trail, he often told the story of a white supporter who came up to him in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The man recalled he had seen <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 20 years earlier at a civil rights demonstration. He was on the other side, wearing the robes of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. The man said he was voting for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in 1988. There were other such dramatic stories along the campaign trail as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> crisscrossed the country courting blue collar workers, farmers, women, gays, Hispanics and other minority groups with his message of `` economic common ground.'' Today, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> claims the legacy of his campaign is in the creation of a coalition forged against `` ancient barriers'' of race, religion, sex. He says he will make it a permanent political force beyond the election. Officially, he launched his 1988 campaign last October. In reality, he had never really stopped campaigning after 1984, continuing to travel the country dazzling audiences with his oratorical skills. His campaign kickoff in a rural <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> hamlet was part of his concerted 1988 effort to attract hard pressed farmers along with others who had suffered in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. The other centerpiece of his campaign was a promise to put a stop to drugs and guns in the streets of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The drug issue quickly became one of the most consistent crowd pleasers in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stump speech. Soon others in the race were also hitting the drug theme. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speeches were often as motivational as political in orientation. `` I want something government ca n't give you,'' he told a rally last week. `` I want you to feel better about yourself, lift your spirits. `` Just because it rains you do n't have to drown,'' was a vintage <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> line. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s trademark was crowds numbering in the thousands. His penchant for wading into the throng to shake hands and pick up babies contributed to another trademark, a schedule that invariably ran hours behind schedule. It was a non-traditional candidacy _ that of a black Baptist minister who had never held any governmental post. His views were on the far left of his party in a year when Democrats were moving toward centrist positions. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made it a point from the beginning to stake out a more conciliatory posture than his rebel stance of 1984, when he alienated many Democrats by attacks on his own party. He brought in advisers with longtime party credentials, and in contrast to 1984 spent time meeting with congressional and state level Democratic leaders. He made friends like the popular <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> agriculture commissioner, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>. He found some enemies, like the outspoken mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who made himself the voice of the anti-Jackson Jewish vote. In the numerous debates held by the seven Democratic contenders, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> invariably seized the chance to lend levity to the events. The others scrapped among themselves, generally leaving him out of the fray. That gave <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> the chance to appear the peacemaker, bringing the focus back to attacking Republicans. `` I think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has been good for the party,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> businessman who was in President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s inner circle and became an adviser to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Other Democrats began to look on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as more than a fringe candidate when he swept several states in the 20-state Super Tuesday primaries on March 8. After his respectable showings in other states, that set the stage for his <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> upset on March 26. But after the contest narrowed to just <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he could no longer benefit from being the most famous person in a pack of lesser knowns who were splitting the rest of the vote. And some ghosts from 1984 refused to go away _ most notably the antipathy toward him by <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> voters who were offended that he had called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Hymietown'' and by his past association with <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and his pro-Palestinian positions. As the delegate margin slipped away from him, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> increasingly sent a message that went beyond just the presidential campaign. `` I will never surrender. Do n't you surrender,'' he told his audiences. Although the words came in the context of the presidential campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> clearly meant someting broader. `` What have I built? A coalition to change the course of our nation for the better,'' he said. `` I've pushed back walls, I've lifted ceilings.

 <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoegbauer </PERSON> says the next time she meets comedian <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> she'll know exactly what to say. `` Oh, my <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>,'' she said, repeating the line <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> told her after the two met at <LOCATION> Mitchell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Stoegbauer </PERSON>, 22, a <ORGANIZATION> Marian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> student, was returning from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on June 8 when a stewardess told her Cosby was on the airplane. <PERSON> Stoegbauer </PERSON>, a longtime Cosby fan, tracked down the comedian in the airport and then screamed, `` Oh my God!'' `` And then he just turned around and said, ` God?

<TEXT>
 The biblical fragrance of frankincense is on the market again as <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> revives an ancient perfume industry that flourished 3,000 years ago. The <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> Perfumery is opening new markets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Amouage </LOCATION>, Arabic for waves, a perfume based on frankincense and myrrh. At about $ 375 an ounce, Amouage may be the world's most expensive perfume. Frankincense, the gum from a desert shrub called boswellia carterii, was prized in ancient times as a drug, a medicine and an aromatic. Legend had it that frankincense trees were guarded by winged serpents and that only an elite tribe could tap the bark for the precious resin. Myrrh, the resin of a plant that looks like a small cactus without the prickles, was once harvested in <LOCATION> Dhofar </LOCATION> province where, legend has it, the three kings gathered before following the star of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> to pay homage to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. Amouage was developed in 1984 by the government-supported perfumery, also known as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amouage </ORGANIZATION>, and has been one of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>'s major successes in its effort to diversify the country's oil-based economy following the slump in oil prices `` Amouage is the Rolls-Royce of perfumes,'' <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Mukheini </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amouage </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing executive, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was created for people who do n't have to ask the price.'' It took four years for master perfumer <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, a Frenchman, to develop the fragrance. He came up with three varieties that were tested on men and women in the West and around the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. A winning bouquet emerged, and the formula is a closely guarded secret. What is known is that Amouage contains more than 100 natural ingredients, including <PERSON> Dhofari </PERSON> frankincense and myrrh, Omani lime, and Omani rose found on the 6,000-foot-high slopes of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>. Added to these are exotic items including the honey-scented tuberose, jasmine, blue chamomile, orris, vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, geranium and musk. The fragrance for men is decidedly musky. The women's is more floral. <PERSON> Amouage </PERSON> has 50 major outlets in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and despite its price, it appears to have a growing clientele. It is sold in sterling silver flasks with 24-carat gold inlays. But it also is sold in cellophane sachets at airport shops. The perfumery, on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Muscat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>'s capital, declined to disclose dollar figures but said sales last year rose by 16 percent over 1986. Officials anticipate another rise this year with a new marketing drive into other parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. `` We'll soon be marketing a new brand of the exotic Arabian perfume, to be sold in French-made crystal and at about 35 percent the price of the Amouage in the silver flasks,'' <PERSON> al-Mukheini </PERSON> said. The government of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, a sultanate the size of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> on the southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula, is giving guidance on harvesting to frankincense growers and helping them find markets. There are no statistics on current frankincense production, but there are an estimated 400,000 to 500,000 frankincense trees in <LOCATION> Dhofar </LOCATION>. Three thousand years ago, the most sought after frankincense in the world came from <LOCATION> Dhofar </LOCATION>, on the edge of the desolate Empty Quarter. It was carried by camel train over the great caravan routes across the Hadramut desert to <LOCATION> Babylon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> or shipped in dhows to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the Orient. About 3,000 tons are said to have been shipped annually during the time of Christ. The Greek philospher <PERSON> Herodotus </PERSON> wrote that 2 -LCB- tons of frankincense were burned every year in the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Babylon </LOCATION>, now part of modern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A vertical incision is made in the bark of the tree, which can range from 6 to 24 feet in height. The gum oozes from the tree and hardens into translucent pearl-shaped drops.

<HEAD>Moderates Battling For Southern Baptist Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Southern Baptists squared off Sunday for another battle over control of the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination, now firmly in the hands of the fundamentalist wing. As thousands of `` messengers'' gathered here for their annual convention, some observers said the moderate camp might make a comeback after nine years of defeat. `` It looks as if moderates could win in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>,'' wrote <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, editor of the `` <ORGANIZATION> SBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>,'' urging the other side to bring in voters to avert such an outcome. Convention business begins Tuesday after a day of preliminary meetings and preaching. Up to 40,000 people are expected to attend as representatives of the church's 14.7 million members. The conflict in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, as the denomination is known, has intensified over the last year as increased fundamentalist power drove various leaders out of office and imposed tighter rules of belief. The struggle, fought largely over the issue of whether the Bible is the literal truth, has stirred up bitter feelings and sharp words. `` Clever men have stripped us of our rights,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baugh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businessman and layman of the moderate camp. Fundamentalism, he said, brings out an `` insatiable appetite for power and demand for conformity.'' `` It's time to stop this nonsense of barbarian attacks on that which we hold dear.'' A pro-fundamentalist former convention president, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Euless </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said after a recent clash with a moderate leader: `` It seems to be a situation of who can outmuscle the other. They have given us no alternative.'' A man in the middle, the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who for three years has headed a peace committee trying to calm the turmoil, said the denomination is `` in a crisis of spirit.'' The peace plan, he said, has been repeatedly violated and there has been an `` acceleration of political activity'' by both sides with partisan strategy meetings held in numerous states. At the center of the conflict is the denomination's powerful presidency, which has the authority to appoint trustees who control Southern Baptist agencies and institutions. Most of those boards now have fundamentalist majorities as a result of the wing's nine years of presidential victories. The crucial decision at this week's meeting is election of a new president. The two camps have rallied behind the expected opposing nominees, and campaigns for them have rolled across the country. Backed by the fundamentalist wing is the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON>, co-pastor of the 18,000-member <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The expected moderate nominee is the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, also with 18,000 members. Both are fundamentalists in their views of the Bible, whose interpretation has been at the crux of the struggle, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does n't favor imposing his view on institutional trustees, while Vines does. `` I would not appoint anyone to any committee,'' <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> said, `` who did not endorse'' prescriptions laid down by the peace committee. It insists the Bible is without error and on belief in its text as literal truth _ that <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve were real people, that the biblical miracles actually occurred, and that the Bible accurately records history. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I do n't believe there ought to be a control group,'' and that if he wins election, it would mean `` a change to allow Baptists to be free again.'' The winner will succeed the Rev. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a fundamentalist standard-bearer who has held the post a customary two years. His previous election in 1979 inaugurated the fundamentalist tide.

 <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> is off to see the Munchkins, the wonderful Munchkins of Oz. But he has no Yellow Brick Road to follow in his search for the little people who greeted <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> in the 1939 film `` The Wizard of Oz.'' `` It may not be easy to find some of them,'' said the writer. `` I know there are some still living, but they've sort of fallen into the woodwork.'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> is writing a book about the little people who sang and danced with the young <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> in the musical based on <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s magical tale of good and bad witches, a bumbling wizard and <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s lovable friends, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>'s book, `` Oz Remembered: Memoirs of the Munchkins,'' will be published by E.P. <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and released next year to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the MGM movie classic. `` There are hundreds of thousands of people out there who are fascinated by the Munchkins,'' said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinet </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> editor. So far, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> has located about 30 of the 124 people who played <LOCATION> Munchkinland </LOCATION> villagers and soldiers. He has spent days poring over telephone directories and making calls with not much to go on but old address books and faded sign-in sheets from long-ago lunches on the movie's set. `` I figure it's about time to give them some credit,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that the movie credits gave them little mention. `` All it said was ` The Singer Midgets as the Munchkins.' Their scene lasts about 10 minutes, but I think it's the most enchanting part of the whole movie.'' For <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Pellegrini </PERSON>, being a Munchkin meant a chance to meet movie stars and other people of her size. She was 16 when the movie was made and is nearing 70 now, she said recently from her home in <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` Meeting up with all the little people, because I had n't been around very many little people _ it was just a great experience.'' `` I did n't think it would be so popular. Of course, I was excited about it and I was thinking, ` Oh boy, I'm going to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>.''' `` A lot of the Munchkins think: A book on the Munchkins? Is that really going to sell?'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. `` They do n't realize how popular they are.'' Most of the men and women who played the Munchkins were recruited by two troupes of vaudeville midgets headed by <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Major </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>. But many of them had never acted before and some were from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and did n't speak English, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. A few of them went on in show business, but most eventually settled into other jobs, he said. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, now 69, continued acting for a time, then returned home to the family business selling grave monuments. <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aubin </PERSON> opened a tavern in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> Midget </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and walked along the bar serving drinks. <PERSON> Meinhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Raabe </PERSON> went on to portray Little Oscar for <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> lunchmeats and made promotional appearances around the country.

 Amid the cheers that greeted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech to a Republican gathering were sighs of relief from party activists pleased that he finally took the offensive against Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. While the high command of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential election campaign pushed at the weekend conference for grass-roots work from <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> regulars, party people from 16 states voiced new hope about the vice president's prospects. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself set last Thursday as an important turning point in his campaign, using a speech in his adopted hometown of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to lash out at the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> record and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's `` out of the mainstream'' beliefs <PERSON> Top </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides said it always had been the plan that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would turn his rhetorical guns on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ but only at the end of the primary and caucus season, when the identity of his fall opponent was unmistakable. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had `` pretty well shot his specific bolts'' at him, and said, `` we're just beginning.'' This proved heartening to Republicans who traveled to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> for the first of three unity conferences scheduled by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Two more will be held in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` I wanted to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> become his own man as soon as possible because you've got to grab the initiative,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman from <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` I was afraid that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would wait until after the August convention to go and speak out.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and other Republicans interviewed over the weekend agreed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still must overcome the obstacle of campaigning for president while holding the office of vice president. And they said he must be careful of moving too far away from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> because that could alienate people in his own party. `` I think it was critically important for him to start talking about the facts about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` This was something I was really pleased to see.'' Several GOP figures said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s early clinching of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> nomination _ the late-April <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary put him over the top _ had the effect of forcing the vice president to the sidelines. They also said this caused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> too often to be on the defensive, to find himself questioned more on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration record than on his own plan for the nation's future. `` Our contest did n't last as long. We ended watching the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis-Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> show from the sidelines,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Gov <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>. `` I think that's cost him.'' <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have to work especially hard in western states where there was an absence of any genuine <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination competition late in the primary season. Punch Green, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s state campaign chairman in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said the vice president's wide-ranging attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions and his record as governor will help `` make the contrast come out.'' Not only that, he said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems far more comfortable making speeches in which he couples explanations of his own positions with criticisms of those held by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I was just elated'' with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speeches in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Thursday and in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Friday, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` For the first time in a long time, I heard a real campaign speech from my candidate.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his top campaign aides seemed buoyed by the tub-thumping speeches of support given at this unity conference by former GOP White House rivals <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. But the vice president's aides and the men who likely will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign surrogates also said the Republican ticket must work hard to retain some of the Democratic and independent support that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> enjoyed in 1980 and 1984. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON>, who worked on <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s campaign, said that `` tens of thousands'' of Democrats crossed over to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to support <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pinsky </PERSON> said the party must work hard to keep these `` issue-driven'' voters in the Republican fold. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign must not write off any region of the country or any group. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pointedly reached out for Hispanic support, saying he opposed a proposal to make English the official language and saying he did n't feel people ought to be threatened by `` the growing Hispanic-American population.'' <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> `` Joe'' Barrego of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> committee, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` putting all his affirmative actions out front.'' `` I think he's doing the right thing right now,'' said <PERSON> Barrego </PERSON>, whose organization speaks for people from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Chinese and several other countries.

 An Israeli bus driver shot and killed an 18-year-old Palestinian on Sunday after his passenger bus was stoned, a hospital official said. Firefighters battled dozens of blazes blamed on Arab arsonists. The army confirmed the stoning of the bus near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION> and said an Arab man was reported dead. It said it was investigating the circumstances of his death. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, stone-throwing protests broke out for a third day. Near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> man was seriously injured when he was hit with a rock. A spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an Arab-American advocate of civil disobedience, would likely be deported by Monday after losing an appeal to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The court said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who has a home in <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, did not have a legal residence permit and was in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> under an expired visa in his American passport. An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian driver fired at assailants who stoned his passenger bus as he drove past the Ein el-Sultan refugee camp near <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Jericho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said a camp resident, <PERSON> Saed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakak </PERSON>, died of wounds to the heart and back after he was shot by the bus driver. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. The death raised to 205 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began Dec. 8. Two Israelis have died. Three more fires broke out Sunday, and Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> blamed Arab arsonists for brush and forest fires that have destroyed at least 35,000 acres of trees and pastures since May. `` There is no doubt that it is part of the intefadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- and linked to what is happening in the territories and to Israeli Arabs,'' <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. The latest fires erupted in the <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, near an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> weather station outside <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, and near the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Ramot </LOCATION>. The radio said a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> teen-ager was detained and confessed to setting the weather station fire. <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said several Arab suspects have been detained, including two <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> teen-agers who have confessed to setting some of the fires. A leaflet published by the underground leadership of the uprising called on Arabs to `` destroy and burn all the enemies' agricultural and industrial resources. In <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, eight <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers were treated for effects of tear gas after a clash with soldiers at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hussein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, an official at the city's <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. The army confirmed there were riots at the high school but had no further comment. Near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, 27-year-old Israeli <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Baranes </PERSON> was in a cardiac intensive care unit at <ORGANIZATION> Assaf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harofe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after being hit by a rock on a road connecting the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Nes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ziona </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rishon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lezion </ORGANIZATION>, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Orit </PERSON> <PERSON> Daka </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Daka </PERSON> said police detained several Arab suspects. She declined to elaborate. But Israeli radio said a 17-year-old Palestinian confessed to the attack. The expulsion order against the Jerusalem-born <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, came despite repeated appeals against the move by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials claimed <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> encouraged violence in the occupied territories. `` There is no reason why we should n't deport this man who is one of the leaders of the intefadeh,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. `` He -LRB- Awad -RRB- claims he is non-violent, but much violence has resulted from his activities.'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s American-born wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, has denied Israeli charges that her husband authored leaflets urging violence. But his ideas for strikes and tax boycotts have been adopted by the uprising's leaders The government ordered <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s deportation May 6. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which upheld the government's decision June 5 but gave no specific date for his expulsion.

<BYLINE>Government Calls For Tighter Discipline On Campuses</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leading newspapers Sunday carried a stern government call for tighter discipline and more ideological indoctrination among students following a week of political agitation at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our college students should uphold the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- party leadership, uphold socialism,'' the official party newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, admonished in a front-page article. <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> authorities tore down dozens of posters students had put up in the past week. The posters demanded democracy, an end to government bureaucracy and corruption, and better living conditions. Putting up anonymous posters is against university rules. The unrest was triggered by the slaying June 2 of <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> <PERSON> Qingfeng </PERSON>, a 22-year-old physics student who died in an off-campus brawl. University officials allowed students to set up a small shrine to <LOCATION> Chai </LOCATION> in a room used for staff meetings. Dozens of paper flower wreaths lined the small space, but the messages were non-political, expressing sorrow over <PERSON> Chai </PERSON>'s death. Students said they were not sure when they would be allowed to hold a memorial service for <PERSON> Chai </PERSON>. The killing brought to the surface student unhappiness over poor living conditions on campus and bleak economic prospects after graduation for the nation's low-paid intellectuals. Thousands of students last week protested <PERSON> Chai </PERSON>'s death by taking to the streets and calling for a pro-democracy march to central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. Police sealed off the square to keep protesters away. The students said <PERSON> Chai </PERSON> was beaten to death by `` hooligans'' when he was buying liquor at a store, and they put up posters angrily demanding speedy punishment of the unemployed local youths who had allegedly killed him. The demonstration was the largest since massive pro-democracy rallies in December 1986 and January 1987. Hundreds of students also gathered on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for impromptu debates on what broader lessons are to be learned from the incident. The People's Daily said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> met Friday and ordered that `` those who have violated school regulations should be dealt with quickly and severely,'' but it did not say what steps would be taken. Without specifically mentioning the unrest at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the commission said that a few students `` can not tell right from wrong with regard to some political principles and even openly spread reactionary views.'' The newspaper called for increased ideological education and better school administration to maintain order. `` Any words or actions that impair party leadership, discipline, stability and unity also obstruct the reforms and are against the basic interests of the people of the whole country,'' the newspaper quoted the education commission as saying. The commission's message also was carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and most national newspapers published the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report. With the school year almost at an end, the extent of any discipline may not become clear until a new semester starts in September. At the university, campus bulletin boards that until Saturday were plastered with dozens of posters criticizing the government were almost bare, with only a few notices for music recitals and graduate school exam preparation. The few students reading the notices said they thought the political unrest was over. The government made it clear last week that it would not permit a repeat of the massive student pro-democracy marches of 1986-87. That winter, thousands of students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other major cities took to the streets to demand Western-style political reforms to match the country's economic reforms. Conservatives in the leadership ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> for failing to halt the student protests quickly enough. This time, authorities moved decisively. Within 48 hours of <PERSON> Chai </PERSON>'s slaying, police tried to defuse tensions by arresting six suspects.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denied Sunday that he had violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conflict-of-interest rules in his financial dealings and declared `` I am extremely confident'' of being cleared. `` I'm have n't done anything dishonest or illegal,'' said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. `` I'm convinced I have n't violated any rules of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s comments came during back-to-back appearances on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' They were part of his response to an announcement Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee that it was beginning a preliminary inquiry into the allegations. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> held a two-hour news conference Friday to deny the allegations and he repeated many of those statements on Sunday. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called the charges `` a partisan political ploy'' raised by Republicans seeking to deflect Democratic charges of ethical violations by current and former members of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` It's a partisan ploy and it will be revealed to be a partisan ploy,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said on the CBS program. The committee's inquiry was originally suggested by Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., but the panel said its investigation would range beyond the scope proposed by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> Next month, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> will preside next month over the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and he said Sunday that he does n't expect the ethics investigation to have any effect on that role. Asked on the CBS show if he would give up that chairmanship, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` I do n't expect to.'' Asked if his running the convention would hurt the Democrats, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> answered, `` There is no cloud over my head, no sir. ... I've done nothing unethical, nothing illegal, nothing violative of the rules of the House. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> declined to say if he thought the investigation should be handled by an independent counsel, rather than the ethics committee in the Democratic-controlled House. `` I'm not trying to tell the committee how to conduct its inquiry,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. Asked if he wanted the investigation done by the committee or an independent counsel, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> answered, `` I do n't have a preference.'' But he continued, `` I want it resolved and I want it resolved as quickly as possible'' and he pledged full cooperation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defended his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' from which he received a 55 percent royalty totaling about $ 55,000. Questions have been raised about whether that royalty percentage is higher than is normally paid. `` There was nothing wrong with the contract,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, later adding, `` I think it's a good book.'' Asked about reports that his friends were buying the books as a way to give financial support to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, he answered, `` I did n't sell these books'' to friends `` Royalty proceeds are going to my favorite charity _ Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and me,'' he said. The ethics committee is investigating whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used one of his staff members to work on the book at taxpayer expense, whether the royalty amounts were excessive, and whether they were paid in return for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> giving some of his campaign business to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the publisher. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> served more than four months in federal prison after pleading guilty in 1975 to income tax evasion charges. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had written a letter to the federal court on <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s behalf. `` It may have been poor judgment'' to write the letter, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, although he defended his long friendship with <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and said, `` I'm not ashamed of that.'' `` Sure, I've made mistakes of judgment, but I have n't done anything dishonest or illegal,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said.

 Police clashed Sunday with demonstrators protesting a constitutional amendment that made Islam the state religion. Authorities said 50 people suffered minor injuries. The demonstrations coincided with a one-day strike called to protest the new law, passed Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and signed into law by President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. Police and witnesses said about 20 vehicles, most of them state-owned buses, were damaged by the demonstrators and that two bicycle rickshaws were set ablaze. They said 30 people were arrested. Police said there was no major violence and that groups of protesters were small because of heavy rains. Most of the injuries occurred when police with wooden sticks charged demonstrators outside <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> College and at a ferry terminal in nearby Sadarghat, witnesses said. The strike, which was called by 20 major opposition parties to protest the legislation, closed down most shops and private businesses. Government offices remained open, but attendance was reported as poor. The strike disrupted transportation, including inter-city bus service, and delayed flights from <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s airport. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said several trains were stalled when protesters blocked tracks. Reports from other cities, including <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> in the south and <LOCATION> Sylhet </LOCATION> in the north, indicated widespread compliance with the strike, which ended at dusk. <PERSON> Rashed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Menon </PERSON>, leader of a five-party leftist opposition alliance, said the adherence to the strike indicated that `` the people have rejected the law making Islam the state religion.'' The opposition parties claim the new law is illegal because it was passed by a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> dominated by <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, whose party won a majority in a 1986 election the opposition contends was rigged. The 20 major opposition parties have no vote in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since they boycotted elections last March, saying that fair polling could not be held under <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, a former army general who took power in a bloodless 1982 coup.; aiting on a <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> street corner for a bus to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the presidential campaign has not been interesting, especially since neither Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> nor Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> have taken an active role. `` They can still be vice president and that would make this a better election,'' she said. On the famed Boardwalk in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, tourists seemed to favor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but many stressed that they were `` settling'' only because they dislike <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He seems as if he's been in the background for the past eight years, and he has n't done very much,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, who was taking time out from a Communication Workers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> union convention. `` The only other candidate I might have supported has been involved in scandals,'' he said. `` I liked <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> _ his appearance, his charisma.'' Another <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> fan was found waiting for a train in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morin </PERSON>, 21, of Sea Bright, said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> `` would have made a good president. I do n't care what he does in his private life.'' Looking realistically at the potential ticket, <PERSON> Morin </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic choices, but `` I like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> best.'' Back on the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stout </PERSON> said the only way <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could win `` is if he comes up with a strong running mate.'' <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomponio </PERSON>, a 36-year-old computer technician from <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, said he would like to see <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate. `` I think it would be a big boost for minorities,'' he said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- seems like he can handle the vice presidential job and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seems like he would be a good president.'' <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> disagrees. The <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> resident said he doubts he will even vote in the general election in November. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> will be in the running,'' he said. <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> looked patriotic dressed in red, white and blue. But her sentiments over the likely presidential candidates were largely disappointment. `` They're both lousy,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is too weak; he's another <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a big mouth. I do n't like his tactics, and I think he lies. I think he knows more about the Contra situation but he says he does n't.'' Two rare <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters turned up among the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>'s morning relaxation crowd. `` The government now is run by Republicans and it's good so far,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciarlone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, with his wife, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, nodding in assent next to him. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not a strong leader.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Say Contras Attack; Farmers Praise Calm</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS COLINAS, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Sandinista army patrols said Nicaraguan rebels attacked their troops in separate incidents in the north, and one officer said the insurgents yelled that they had orders to break a truce. A rebel spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who identified himself only as <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> said Saturday night he had no reports of the attacks or that the cease-fire had ended. `` If they attack our positions, we have to return fire,'' he said. A fragile truce was declared March 21, the start of face-to-face talks between the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras and the Soviet-supported government troops. But a series of talks, the latest ending on Thursday, made little headway in ending the civil war that has killed more than 26,000 people. The 60-day cease-fire was to end May 31, but the two sides extended it by tacit agreement, each saying it would initiate no `` offensive'' action against the other but would take defense action if necessary. Second Lt. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizo </PERSON>, the commander of a group of Sandinista soldiers, said Contra rebels ambushed a small unit of his troops early Saturday in <LOCATION> Jinotega </LOCATION> province, about 160 miles northeast of the capital, <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rizo </PERSON> said there were no injuries. `` They just started shooting,'' he said. Earlier Saturday, Lt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorado </PERSON> reported heavy fighting Friday farther north, in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colinas </LOCATION>. `` We sent a message with a farmer to the Contras saying we wanted to talk,'' said <PERSON> Dorado </PERSON>. `` They responded with rifle fire.'' <PERSON> Dorado </PERSON> said that during the half hour of fighting, the Contras yelled to him that `` they had orders to break the truce.'' He said the government troops suffered no injuries but that one <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> died and three suffered wounds. Residents heard the gunfire but called it minor compared to fighting in the region before the cease-fire. The truce has given many in battle-scarred northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> a chance to resume duties they had abandoned in fear. `` It used to be terrible,'' said <PERSON> Griselva </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, 48. `` There were bombings, missiles, mortars and shooting all the time.'' Nearby, around the village of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, several bullet-pocked homes sat abandoned. Weeds and vines grew over the shells of houses. `` Thank God there's a truce,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Rica </PERSON> became a ghost town a few years ago because of heavy fighting. But Nicaraguans have moved back, and a hilltop Sandinista military base now guards the town. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lago </PERSON> said he had moved away from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> but returned in April, about a month after the cease-fire was signed, to plant corn before the May rains. `` It's calm now, but it was bad,'' he said. <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rugama </PERSON>, a 40-year-old farmer living in nearby <LOCATION> Quebrada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, said the truce has brought peace and freedom of movement to the region. `` We just want to work and live in peace,'' he said. `` Now there's sort of peace.''

 Two years ago, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> would stand on the beach in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> and release balloons to float across the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, hoping to help thaw a Cold War ban on travel between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. People laughed and called him crazy. But on Monday, <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> will take off on a flight to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, accompanied by 80 politicians, <PERSON> Eskimos </PERSON> and reporters, crossing a border that has been closed for 40 years. `` There was a lot of skepticism at first,'' <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> recalled Thursday from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, in a telephone interview often interrupted by calls from the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> governor's office and others helping to plan Monday's `` Friendship Flight'' to the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>. `` There were a lot of people who thought it would n't happen in our lifetime,'' <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> said. `` There were a lot of people who thought I was eccentric and questioned my loyalty and my motivations.'' The real estate agent says his motivations are simple: Two years ago, at the start of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s oil recession, business was slow and he had time to think up ways of improving his own fortune and that of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, a town of 3,700 people on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s western coast. <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON>, 40, figured that if someone could pry open the <LOCATION> Alaska-Siberia </LOCATION> border, closed in 1948 because of Cold War tensions, then <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> could become an economic center for both sides of the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. He envisioned increased trade, joint economic ventures, and tourist excursions by airplanes and cruise ships between <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. He also saw opportunities for cultural exhange. His wife, <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON>, is a King Island Eskimo, and <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> heard stories of how Eskimos earlier this century took boats to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to trade and visit relatives. `` I heard tales of people wanting to go over there, and I wondered why they were n't doing anything about it,'' <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> said. He set out to do something. In addition to the balloons, he got a huge `` Peace'' sign in Russian placed on <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diomede </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, just three miles from the Soviet island of Big <PERSON> Diomede </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> also fired letters off to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet leaders. `` I've probably written somewhere between 500 and 700 letters _ probably 5,000 to 6,000, including copies,'' he said. `` It was the shotgun approach. I hit them at the very top, I hit them in the middle, and I hit them at the bottom.'' Gradually, <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> fever began to catch on in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. Local radio station <ORGANIZATION> KNOM </ORGANIZATION> started broadcasting a weekly update on <ORGANIZATION> Siberia-Alaska </ORGANIZATION> events in <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and English, later adding a Russian `` word of the day.'' <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> also was aided by good timing: Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness paved the way for improved Alaska-Siberia relations. Last August, the Soviets allowed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> swimmer <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> to cross from <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Diomede </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diomede </LOCATION>, and Siberian medical researchers signed a joint research agreement with Alaskan scientists in November. The biggest break came last fall, when <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumped on the `` Friendship Flight'' bandwagon, hoping to establish a regular tourist route, he said. Government officials who brushed off a real estate agent's letters about flights to <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> began getting similar letters from executives of a major corporation. `` As long as just one person was doing it, it never would have reached this level of credibility,'' <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> would like to see the whole <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> border opened. He would like to see more joint ventures in fishing, telecommunications, and trade. Many who once scoffed at his dreams now give him the benefit of the doubt. `` It was only a short while ago that this flight was a dream,'' said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Cancelmi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` I personally wondered if this day would ever come. `` I do n't think <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> ever thought for a moment that it would n't, and that's what it takes to make something like this come true.''

 An AIDS drug can dramatically boost the intelligence of youngsters whose brains are damaged by the AIDS virus and even restores their ability to walk and talk, researchers said Sunday. Damage to the brain is one of the earliest and most devastating of the effects of the lethal virus in children. The research suggests that the drug AZT can reverse these symptoms and apparently bring virus-damaged brain cells back to health. AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is the only medicine routinely used to suppress the AIDS virus, called HIV. In adults, it can slow the progression of AIDS but does not cure it. The latest research, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, was presented at the Fourth International Conference on AIDS. <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>'s findings came unexpectedly during testing of a portable pump to administer the drug to children. He found that youngsters' IQ scores increased about 15 points, and many of the other severe brain symptoms of the virus also went away `` Everybody who looks at this data has to get excited,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases. `` We are all nervous by small numbers -LRB- of patients studied -RRB-, but the data itself is very exciting.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Considering Charges in CIA Stamp Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether to file charges against nine <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employees who two years ago made thousands of dollars selling misprinted stamps the agency had acquired for regular postage, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. After the stamp matter become public last September, some of the stamps, known in the trade as `` <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inverts,'' were sold by collectors for as much as $ 50,000 each. It is not known exactly how much the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employees received for the stamps, but it is known that the stamps' value increased because of the scandal. One collector, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reznikoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said last year he bought 18 of them for nearly $ 1 million. The agency's public integrity section is looking into the original sale of the stamps in 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employees, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, following a reported internal review of the case by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the integrity section deals `` in bringing criminal charges, if necessary.'' But <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> indicated no action was imminent. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had completed an internal investigation of the nine employees involved in the stamp sale and had turned over the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said last September that the agency investigated and found no wrongdoing in the matter. The employees replaced the stamps with stamps of equal face value, officials said. The stamps are a misprinted version of a $ 1 stamp that includes a candlestick and the inscription: `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Light Fueled By Truth and Reason.'' In the misprints, the candlestick is upside down. Department officials are considering whether to bring charges of theft or misappropriation of government supplies against the employees, who replaced a sheet of 95 stamps, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Nine of the stamps were either kept by the employees or used in <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> postage, one was worthless because it was torn, and 85 were sold to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> dealer for thousands of dollars, according to stamp experts. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has not released the names of the employees involved. Postal officials have said that 305 other stamps from the same printed sheet were either destroyed by postal personnel, used as postage or discovered and saved by collectors.

 Bishops in southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have assailed a plan by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to transfer 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighter-bombers from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Bishops in <LOCATION> Puglia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION>, the regions where the planes are likely to be based, issued statements criticizing the government for agreeing to accept the fighter wing, which <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> no longer wants. Four Calabrian bishops issued a statement late last week which they described as an `` ethical evaluation'' of the plan. `` Arms, when they are a power game, are structures of sin,'' their statement said. They said it would be `` ethically irritating'' if the F-16s are based in <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION> `` as an economic solution to our long-standing problems.'' Earlier in the week, seven Puglian bishops said `` <LOCATION> Puglia </LOCATION> is already paying a heavy price in servitude to programs of military armament'' and the region `` could constitute a top priority target'' if the planes are based there. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> recently said the jets of the 401st <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> must leave <LOCATION> Torrejon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Sunday he is not claiming that the Democrats should offer him the vice presidency `` because I do not want to push <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to that point,'' but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reiterated that he deserves serious consideration for the No. 2 job. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, runner-up to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the race for the party's presidential nomination, appeared to back down from recent statements in which he said he should be offered the vice presidency because of his second-place finish. Asked if in his comments he was saying he should be offered the nomination and then would decide whether to accept it, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` No, I'm not saying that because I do not want to push <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to that point. It's not necessary.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, interviewed from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' said he has not made a decision on whether he would accept the vice presidency, but he added, `` I believe I've earned serious consideration.'' `` I brought to this campaign a broadened base, a moral tone and my constituency represents the growth of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, represents the future of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` We won nearly 7 million votes from every sector of the population. We've earned serious consideration at every level of our party That includes the ticket.'' Confusion over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s position increased this past week when a <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> report on Thursday quoted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as saying he wants to be vice president. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, asked to clarify the issue, said Friday, `` Let's leave it at consideration.'' But on Saturday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his experience in foreign policy would strengthen a ticket with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says he wants a vice president with foreign policy experience. Well ...,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, pausing to an ovation from a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> crowd of about 1,200. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said he was not interested in a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post, saying, `` an appointment position is also a disappointment position. A vice presidential position is a constitutional position from which you can not be fired because you're elected by the people.'' Asked Sunday what was more important _ making history as the first black on a party ticket or helping the Democrats regain the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he was dedicated to a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory. `` Certainly my commitment is ` A' to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better, and I've tried to do it every day and every way at great risk. It is to see my party win,'' he said. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> added that he does n't believe recent polls that show a Dukakis-Jackson ticket losing in November. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> later flew to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> where he attended the third game of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> championship between the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pistons </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION>. In the television interview, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backed efforts by his supporters, meeting in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with other Democrats on the party platform, to include a call for raising taxes on the rich in the proposed plank. `` We ought to be candid with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` There's no miraculous way of getting out of this budget deficit. ... We certainly can not come out just by collecting the uncollected taxes of Reaganomics. We must collect some exempted taxes of Reaganomics.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has given the Republicans `` a party, now they must pay for the party.'' The Democratic candidate also agreed with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for suggesting that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> move its embassy in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` Secretary <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is correct and every American president has taken that position,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Moving that embassy to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> would not make <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> more secure and that's our concern there. It would not be security for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, not justice for <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, not peace for both.''

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Yankton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION> and their supporters will begin a month-long walk Monday to press their claim for the return of a quarry that yields the red stone used to make sacred <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> pipes. The <LOCATION> Yankton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> believe the site outside <LOCATION> Pipestone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, that is now the <ORGANIZATION> Pipestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION> was illegally taken from them by the federal government more than 60 years ago, tribal Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cournoyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. Tribal members also want to stop the use of the soft, red pipestone to make so-called peace pipes and other items for sale to tourists, he said. `` The sacredness of that pipe is no longer there when people are using it for their gain. It was n't intended to be exploited like that,'' <PERSON> Cournoyer </PERSON> said. `` When everyody's got pipes and they do n't know what they were intended for, that's kind of sacrilegious. The meandering walk will start at Green Grass on the <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION> in the central part of the state. Green Grass is the home of <ORGANIZATION> Arvol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Looking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION>, keeper of the original sacred pipe of the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> tribes. Organizers said they expect about 100 people will start the peaceful march, but the group should grow before the walkers reach the quarry in southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> on July 15. Looking Horse said he became involved in the walk because he's worried about the use of pipestone to make inappropriate items The pipe was given to the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spirit </LOCATION> and smoking it is a central part of their beliefs, said Looking Horse, who said he's the 19th-generation keeper of the pipe `` That's the blood of our people, the red pipestone,'' Looking Horse said. `` Now there's a lot of misuse and abuse of the pipe at <LOCATION> Pipestone </LOCATION>.'' Looking Horse said people from as far away as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have called to say they plan to join in the walk. `` Because there's a lot of people coming back to the old ways, like the young people, I feel there's going to be a lot of people'' on the walk, he said. Before Europeans arrived, pipes and other items made from the stone were traded to many other tribes. The <ORGANIZATION> Yankton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has passed a resolution asking the federal government and the <ORGANIZATION> Pipestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization that helps market items carved from the stone, to give up the monument. The resolution says 1858 and 1892 treaties with the federal government guaranteed the <ORGANIZATION> Yankton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION>'s ownership and use of the quarry. The site was sold to the government in the late 1920s, but the <ORGANIZATION> Yankton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> claim the sale was invalid because it was negotiated by tribal members handpicked by federal officials. <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, superintendent of <ORGANIZATION> Pipestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Yankton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> were paid for the quarry area, which includes a small stream, scenic low cliffs, a museum and a protected area of prairie vegetation, and the monument was established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1937. `` The issue, as we see it, was settled in 1928 or 1929 when they received payment,'' <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON> said he believes the <LOCATION> Yankton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> have the right to attempt to regain the quarry under the Indian Religious Freedom Act. The pipestone, also known as catlinite for artist-explorer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Catlin </PERSON>, is quarried only by Indians, who get permits and use hand tools. Federal officials have no control over what items are made and sold outside the monument, but only items that represent Indian culture are sold at the monument, <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON> said. Up to 90 people depend on the quarry to make a living, he said. However, <PERSON> Looking </PERSON> <PERSON> Horse </PERSON> said it's not proper for the sacred stone to be used for a commercial purpose. `` Because this is sacred to us, we are doing all we can to protect it,'' Looking Horse said. `` The only thing I want is to stop the misuse of that pipestone.''

 The mighty <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> could hit record low levels this summer because of the drought plaguing the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, and already has fallen enough in places to ground barges, officials say. The river stood at just 8 feet on the <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> gauge on May 28, the second-lowest reading on record for that date. By Friday, it had fallen to 3.8 feet, and it was expected to fall to 3 feet by Monday and continue dropping. Monday's predicted reading would be the record low for this time of year _ about 30 feet below normal. The lowest reading at <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> for any date was in the early 1930s when the river dropped to minus 6.7 feet below the level considered as the zero point. At <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, the river could sink below the 7 -LCB- - year-old record of minus 7.3 feet by July 13, according to a 28-day forecast released by the <ORGANIZATION> Lower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> `` The river is still very deep and dangerous, but this is a record low,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. In some areas, the river remains deeper than 100 feet, <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> said. But many points along the boat traffic channel have fallen below the minimum 9-foot depth needed for normal navigation. That means big problems for towboat operators who must lighten cargoes and run the risk of equipment damage if they run aground. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Radlein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, said it would take heavy rainfall over a large part of the central <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to raise the river appreciably. And that's not likely this time of year. `` The types of stages we're reporting now are similar to what you'd normally get in late September, after a hot, dry summer,'' she said. `` And we've still got that ahead of us.'' Normally, this would be the high water season, <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> said, but the <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> expects to have to dredge soon near <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> to keep the channel open. `` It looks like it's going to be a major challenge this year to maintain our navigation project,'' <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure the economic impact is in the millions of dollars already from people having to carry shallow loads. It has an impact on the whole central part of the country.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Golding </PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION> Ole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Man </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, said the drought has cut into his profits. <LOCATION> Ole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Man </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is loading barges for a draft of 8.6 feet rather than the normal 9.6 feet, `` and that last foot sometimes is your only profit margin,'' <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> said. Current cargoes generally are about 10 to 15 percent lighter, he said. The cost of pushing the load is the same or higher, because trips take longer, <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> said. Maintenance costs are higher because of problems with running aground, he said. <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> said the navigable channel is so narrow in places that northbound tows must wait downstream for southbound towboats to pass. Last weekend, 55 barges ran aground at <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, closing that stretch of the river for two days while the tows were disassembled and moved. Friday, the river was reopened from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> for the first time in two days after numerous tows ran aground. The Red River, a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> tributary of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, is closed indefinitely, with some boats stranded upstream. `` It makes for an unpredictable trip,'' <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> said. `` And it puts a lot of stress on the pilots. Last week, we ran aground with one barge and knocked a hole in the bottom. We also knocked a rudder off one of our boats.''

 June Jams are a thing of the future for <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, says the country band's lead singer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. The group's seventh annual charity concert Saturday drew 35,000, and <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said past problems wo n't deter the group from keeping the concert a tradition. Saturday's attendance was far below the 61,000 people who showed up in 1986, when <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> was at the peak of its popularity. But last year's June Jam was hit with heavy rain and paid attendance fell to 20,000, leaving no money for charity. The first five June Jams raised $ 1.5 million. Because of last year's problems, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> and other band members fought rumors that this year's concert would not occur. Once plans became final for Saturday's concert, the band members had to dispel rumors that this would be the last. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he is already making plans to mark the state's homecoming celebration, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reunion </LOCATION>, at June Jam VIII Festivities will include having the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> join the band on stage to sing its hit `` My Home's in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.'' Many entertainers joined <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> for the daylong concert, including the <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON>, Exile, K.T. <PERSON> Oslin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bellamy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, Sweethearts of the Rodeo, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seals </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>. Fans began lining up for the concert 12 days early. First in line was <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, 19, of Bowling Green, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. Miss Hall, who has seen the last four jams, said, `` I sacrifice my social life, everything, for the two weeks.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s interior minister on Sunday denied a Western news report that <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is dying of cancer and said the leader is healthy. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> as saying that he met <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> several days ago and that he is `` now in perfect shape.'' Western analysts believe that a power struggle with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s fractious hierarchy will intensify as various factions seek to seize control of the Islamic revolution after the 87-year-old <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dies <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON> said in an interview in Sunday's edition of the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> daily that the foreign media has been claiming for years that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s health was failing. He charged that the latest report in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television network was `` a Zionist scheme to cheer up <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and his demoralized army.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been at war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> since September 1980. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday that intelligence reports indicated that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> `` may now be very close to death.'' It quoted the reports as saying `` the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON>'s cancer has spread from his prostate to his liver'' and that he `` may only have two or three months to live.'' <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, a hard-liner linked with Shiite Moslem extremists holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said the report could be seen as an Israeli-U.S. response to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s appointment of Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as acting commander-in-chief of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> named <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, one of his closest aides, as military chief in the wake of two battlefield defeats by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the nearly 8-year-old gulf war. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has long been reported to be in a frail condition since he suffered a heart attack two years ago, touching off scores of reports he was dead or dying. He was last seen in public May 13, when he briefly shuffled into the street outside his heavily guarded home in the north <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Jamaran </LOCATION> to vote in parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> held the post of comander-in-chief under <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s revolutionary constitution and had only relinquished it once before since 1979, when he appointed President <PERSON> Abdolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadr </PERSON> in 1980 <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadr </PERSON> fled <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> a year later, hounded by radicals who considered him too liberal. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s apppointment of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> rekindled speculation that the aging patriarch's condition was deteriorating. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has appeared fragile and slow-moving in his few recent public appearances broadcast by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run television, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. Speculation that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was ailing heightened Friday after <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> had visited <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s designated successor, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, in the holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, on Wednesday and Thursday. The agency said the men discussed `` various current issues'' with <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>. But it did not elaborate or give any indication that the meetings were linked to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s health. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> are rivals in the power struggle under way within the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy over who will run the country in the post-Khomeini era. Although <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has designated <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, 65, his successor, the high-ranking cleric lacks <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s power base. He also has been opposed by several leading figures, including <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, long considered the most powerful figure in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. When the patriatch appointed <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as military leader, he said he had acted at the urging of <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. But most analysts believe that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said that to avoid publicly humiliating <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, whose power has been eroded in recent months, and deepening the political divisions in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 A substantial majority of Americans say they would not vote for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, winner of two landslide presidential elections, if he could seek a third term, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll has found. Most Republicans in the national poll supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for another term. But Democrats and independents, whose support was critical to his 1980 and 1984 victories, said overwhelmingly they would not back him again. The decline in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support outside his own party could impede his ability to draw non-Republicans to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has locked up the 1988 GOP presidential nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> needs outside votes to win. In another finding, three-quarters of the 1,204 respondents said a vice presidential candidate's race or sex did not matter to them. However, some independents and Republicans were less likely to support a black, and some Republicans were less likely to support a woman. The survey also found that Americans overwhelmingly would not want to be president, and a plurality would not want their child to have the job. Still, 59 percent thought it possible their child could be president. In 1984, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won 25 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independent voters. But in the survey, just 13 percent of Democrats and 27 percent of independents said they would vote for him for a third term. Presidents are limited by constitutional amendment to two four-year terms in office, and roughly 65 percent each of Republicans, Democrats and independents favored maintaining that limit. But if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could run again, 60 percent of Republicans said they would vote for him, while 85 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of independents said they would not. The total was 32 percent for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 64 percent against. Majorities of conservatives, moderates and liberals alike opposed a third <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> term. Women and poorer Americans were more likely to object. On vice presidential candidates, 75 percent said it would not matter to them if a ticket's second slot were filled by a black or a woman. Still, 17 percent of independents said they would be less likely to vote for a ticket with a black for vice president, compared with 4 percent who would be more likely to back it. The division was wider among Republicans, while there was no measurable split among Democrats. No potential candidate was specified in the survey. Black civil rights activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, second-place finisher for the Democratic nomination for president, has said he should be considered for the vice presidential slot. With a woman for vice president, 20 percent of Republicans said they would be less likely to support the ticket, compared with 6 percent more likely. There was no such reluctance among Democrats or independents. Again, no potential candidate was specified. There have been suggestions that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> select a woman running mate to shore up his support among women. Overall, 10 percent of the respondents said they would be more likely to support a woman for vice president, and 14 percent said less likely. That split came within the margin of sampling error of three points. Given a black vice presidential candidate, 6 percent overall said they would be more likely to lend their support, 18 percent less likely. More than six in 10 said it would not matter to them if a candidate for president were a black or a woman. Five percent said they would be more likely to support a black for president, 27 percent less likely. Ten percent said they would be more likely to back a woman, 25 percent less likely. Asked if they would want the job of president, 89 percent said no. Forty-six percent said they would not want their child to grow up to be president, while 41 percent would. But 89 percent said it matters who gets the job. The Media General-Associated Press poll consisted of telephone interviews April 29-May 8 with a randomly selected sample of 1,204 adults across the nation. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the Tampa -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> -RRB-.

<HEAD>Government Launches Ad Campaign Promoting Local Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two days after banning calls for election boycotts, the government Sunday launched an advertising campaign to promote participation in municipal elections scheduled for October. Full-page newspaper ads urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to `` let your vote speak for you'' in the nationwide elections Oct. 26. `` Vote for a better life for yourself and those who are dear to you,'' said another ad. `` Let the people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> be heard.'' It will be the first time South Africans of all races go to the polls on the same day. They will be voting for more than 7,000 seats on municipal councils in their racially segregated communities. Most anti-apartheid organizations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, as well as the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, oppose black participation in any elections until the black majority is granted full political rights at the national level. The black <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> movement is fighting the government's policy of apartheid, which establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The government, while describing itself as `` pro-democracy,'' says it will never accept a one-person, one-vote system that would allow the blacks to overrule the 5 million whites. On Friday, when it extended a national state of emergency for a third year, the government imposed a new regulation outlawing calls for boycotts of elections, except by a registered political party competing in an election. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes even limited concessions to blacks, charged that the $ 2.3 million ad campaign constitutes use of taxpayers' money to spread propaganda on behalf of President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. A confidential outline of the ad campaign, disclosed by a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader who obtained a copy, said the government's public credibility was not good. An advertising agency suggested in the document that animated cartoon characters be used in television ads to promote voting, because direct communication from the government might be `` unacceptable to the public.'' Information Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> defended the campaign last week, saying it was not partisan. `` It is pro-democracy and anti-revolutionary, for which we do not apologize,'' he said. The ads published Sunday exhorted voters to `` vote for the candidate who will best look after your interests.'' The white municipal elections will provide the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with another chance to gain strength at the expense of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Conservatives won three parliamentary by-elections earlier this year, and they predict a sweep of local elections in towns and small cities throughout <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> province in the north, where more than half of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s whites live. The key question in the black municipal elections is whether the government can prevent disruptions by militants and persuade a significant number of candidates to participate, despite the likelihood that these will be depicted as apologists for the government. Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month that `` radicals and revolutionaries ... regard the elections as a prime target for disruption and intimidation.'' `` It is my duty and your duty to ensure that these elections are a success,'' he told lawmakers.

 Gunmen in passing cars killed a Roman Catholic man Sunday near a church in north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and shot another <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> man in the back in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, police said. Police said they could not immediately link the two attacks. Friends identified the man killed in north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Totten </PERSON>, 46. He was about to get into a car outside his sister's house when he was shot by attackers in another car that drove up alongside, police said. The house was near a church, and dozens of people attending Mass witnessed the attack. At least one of the bullets hit <PERSON> Totten </PERSON> in the head. He was given first aid by some of the churchgoers but died almost instantly. Police appealed to the dozens of men, women and children who witnessed the slaying to come forward. <PERSON> Totten </PERSON> was a driver with the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ireland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> and lived with his two brothers in west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>.

The man, who was not identified, was taken to the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where his condition was described as `` not serious.'' In a third incident, police said six policemen were slightly injured Sunday when a drunken mob of about 600 Protestants hurled bricks, bottles and stones at them in the town of <LOCATION> Armagh </LOCATION>. Five people were arrested and a police officer fired a single shot into the air to quell the trouble. Security forces said the shootings appeared to have been carried out by <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.

Federal election laws limit individual campaign contributions to $ 1,000 for each election. <PERSON> Payte </PERSON> said knew about the limit but wanted to find a way to boost <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s income, the <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` If I wanted to help <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and wanted to give him some money, I could n't do it,'' he said. `` But I could buy his books.'' <PERSON> Payte </PERSON> also said he wrote letters to nearly 50 <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> businessmen urging them each to buy $ 1,000 worth of the books, but did not know if they followed up on the request. He would not name them. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decided last week to conduct a inquiry to determine if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has violated rules on ethics and conflicts of interest. One aspect of the inquiry will be the publication arrangements for his 1984 book `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> orthodontist <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, another longtime <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> friend, said he paid $ 1,000 to publisher <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> after <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told him he was trying to put together a group of about 20 people to finance republication of the book last year. `` I paid to have some republished and a big box -LRB- of books -RRB- was sent to me,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. He added that he had already given <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> the maximum $ 1,000 in campaign contributions. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has acknowledged that some supporters bought large numbers of books, but said it was n't an attempt to get around contribution limits. `` I think that's a mistake,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think anybody really thought that.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> instead said, `` I'm glad they thought enough of the book.'' Meanwhile, another longtime <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> friend of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he was present when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked a congressional aide if he would `` sacrifice a couple of weekends'' to work on the book. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Procter </PERSON>, professor of history at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, recalled the request in a sworn statement <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> provided the ethics committee Friday. One charge the committee will investigate is whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> paid the aide, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossolotto </PERSON>, $ 2,000 in public money to help compile the book. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics manual says congressional employees may not be paid from public funds to perform personal or campaign activities on behalf of a congressman.

<HEAD>Alligator Attack Heats Up Turf War Between Man And Beast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> used to sit back and chuckle when an alligator ventured onto the lawn of his lakefront home, but now he says he'll blast any gator foolish enough to crawl within pistol range. For <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> and other waterfront residents in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the alligator's image has changed dramatically from an amusing visitor to a deadly menace _ a change prompted by the recent fatal alligator attack on a 4-year-old girl in the Gulf Coast community of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> was walking a dog with two playmates in the ankle-deep water of a pond June 4 when a 10 -LCB- foot-long bull gator lunged from the water and snapped the child in its jaws, dragging her underwater to her death. For <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, the turf war between man and beast heats up whenever he broils a couple of steaks on his charcoal grill in the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> neighborhood, wafting an aroma that one 6-foot `` neighborhood'' gator finds irresistible. `` He crawls up the bank right into our back yard and sits there with his back arched _ just staring,'' said <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, a 67-year-old Cuban exile who moved in last year. `` The last time I went and got my gun, but he saw me coming and ran away.'' `` We're seeing a lot of panic out there,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Game and <ORGANIZATION> Freshwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In the week following <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s death, game officials in the state's five regional offices were swamped with 849 complaints from residents wanting alligators removed _ about five times the normal load. `` I try to calm them down but they wo n't take ` no' for an answer,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, who supervises the nuisance-alligator program in 10 south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties. `` Some say if we do n't come out there and destroy the gator in their neighborhood, they're going to do it themselves,'' Game officials last week received a report that a hysterical woman living near the fatal attack `` bashed a 3-foot gator's head in. `` It made her feel a little bit better, but it did n't accomplish anything,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrior </PERSON> of the game commisson, adding that alligators that small eat only minnows and frogs, not people. About 80 percent of the complaints result in a permit issued to destroy the gator, said Lt. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>. Last year, 3,853 alligators were killed, he said. `` Our main concerns are with a gator that's been fed,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Huffstodt </PERSON>, a game commission spokesman in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` People think it's real cute to treat the gator like a pet and give it a name and toss it scraps of food and marshmallows. `` Over time, the gator loses its fear of people and begins to associate people with food _ that's setting the stage for a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Huffstodt </PERSON> said. He added that any bold action toward humans, pets or livestock is enough to order a gator destroyed. That job is turned over to state-licensed trappers, a select group of experts allowed to kill alligators and profit from the armored underbelly skin and the bland-tasting meat. But the fact is, the odds of getting attacked by a gator in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are about the same as getting struck by lightning, game officials say. The latest death marks the sixth documented gator killing along with 95 unprovoked attacks in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since 1948, according to game commission statistics. `` These are the consequences we face as a growing state where people choose to crowd their houses onto the alligator's native habitat,'' said <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maitland </LOCATION>. `` We sometimes forget the gator was here first.'' Biologists estimate there are anywhere from 1 million to 6 million gators in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, nesting in swamps and marshes and even winding their way through drainage tunnels into freshwater pockets of sprawling urban areas. In September, the state will lift a 1962 hunting ban and open a tightly controlled month-long season with a strict kill limit of 3,000 gators, a number not expected to make a dent in the huge population. But homeowner <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> says he still feels a cold shiver of fear whenever he hears the gator's low bellow in the night. <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> has forbidden his nine young grandchildren from playing near the water when they visit; he has ordered a chain-link fence built around his home and he has called on game officials to remove his problem gator. `` I could n't live with myself,'' he said, `` if anything happened to one of my grandchildren.''

<HEAD>Slovenians Demand Release Of Jailed Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the nation's most liberal republic, have demanded the release of two journalists arrested after reporting the armed forces planned a coup in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. Yugoslav President <PERSON> Raif </PERSON> <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON> said an army tribunal's probe of <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON> will be completed soon, a newspaper in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, the capital of the western republic, reported Saturday. The Delo newspaper said <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON> assured Slovenian President <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanovnik </PERSON> during a meeting in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> on Thursday that `` the public would be informed fully as soon as the procedure is over.'' An army sergeant-major also was arrested, apparently on suspicion of providing <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON> with a secret document whose contents were not disclosed. More than 7,000 people in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> have signed a petition for the release of the three men and the arrests have led to a wave of protests in the republic. More than 200 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> cells, companies and trade union organizations are reported to have donated money into a special defense fund. The two well-known reporters were arrested in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> on suspicion of revealing military secrets. Both journalists have written numerous articles criticizing the military. <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON> was taken into custody May 31 and <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON> was arrested five days later. The coup reports were denied by the Yugoslav government, but copies of documents purported to be the minutes of a military advisory body's session and alleging that such a plan existed, have been widely circulated in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>. All three men were being held in a military prison in the Slovenian capital while the investigation is handled by the army's judicial branch Except for two brief communiques by the army prosecutor, the military has not revealed any details about the charges. <PERSON> Jansa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tasic </PERSON> were denied civilian defense attorneys, a highly unusual procedure in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and were held incommunicado until Thursday when family members were allowed to visit them. <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> has long been more liberal than the rest of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and an irritant to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s communist establishment. <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON>, a youth weekly in the republic, has often criticized the army and advocated such liberal causes as conscientious objectors, homosexuals and the environment.

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Seek to Broaden Appeal Among Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The two presidential contenders sought Sunday to broaden their appeal among blacks, with Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urging a strong civil rights agenda and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> meeting with black mayors and promising a tough policy in the war on drugs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, lashed out at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's anti-drug programs, criticizing the president's cuts in the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget and federal aid to state and local police in light of his tough rhetoric on the issue. `` What we have today is chaos,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We've got to back up what we say with what we do.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also met with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> mayors and held a private session with a smaller group of black mayors. The likely Democratic nominee called for tougher drug laws and stringent sentencing guidelines, but he stopped short of urging capital punishment for drug dealers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing to endorse the death penalty for major drug traffickers. The vice president, meanwhile, delivered the commencement address at a predominantly <PERSON> black </PERSON> college in <LOCATION> Wilberforce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he told the 275 graduates of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that the nation needs a `` positive civil rights agenda.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added that the policy must go beyond that to `` knock down the walls of indifference and other barriers that result in economic exclusion.'' The certain <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, responding to reporters' questions, said he would work `` to broaden the base of our party, talk on the issues that I think transcend black, white, American issues that are out there and are going to appeal.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who celebrated his 64th birthday, received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the college. The award was announced last year, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was unable to receive it until Sunday, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamness </PERSON>, a spokesman for the university. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the graduates they made it though college despite `` poverty, broken homes, inadequate schools and the social challenges or threat of drugs and violence.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, focusing on the drug issue in his speech to the nation's mayors, said that the war on drugs can be won, `` but we have to recognize that it is a war, a war of wills, a war of values, a war of confidence and courage and strength.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised that if elected he would increase federal law enforcement staffs and federal aid to state and local police. He did not provide specifics. He also said he would issue an executive order prohibiting the payment of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> or other government funds to suspected drug dealers, a reference to alleged payments to <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` Never again, never again are you going to bankroll a drug peddler who is poisoning our society and killing our children,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, runner-up to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the presidential nomination sweepstakes, appeared to back down from claims that the Democrats should offer him the vice presidency based on his second-place showing. Asked if in his recent comments he was saying he should be offered the nomination and then would decide whether to accept it, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` No, I'm not saying that because I do not want to push <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to that point. It's not necessary.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' said he has not made a decision on whether he would accept the vice presidency, but added, `` I believe I've earned serious consideration.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backed efforts by his supporters, meeting in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with other Democrats on the party platform, to include a call for raising taxes on the rich in the proposed plank. `` We ought to be candid with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` There's no miraculous way of getting out of this budget deficit. ... We certainly can not come out just by collecting the uncollected taxes of Reaganomics. We must collect some exempted taxes of Reaganomics.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has given the Republicans `` a party, now they must pay for the party.'' The Democrats, winding up their weekend meeting, sidestepped the question of the federal deficit and whether to call for higher taxes on the rich. The party regulars did agree to brand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, called for the appointment of a federal drug czar, adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, an end to homelessness, expansion of AIDS research and providing advance notice of plant closings. `` I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the drafting panels' chair, following the three-day meeting on <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Decaturs Of The World Compete To Raise Food For The Needy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City officials have learned the answer to the question on their promotional T-shirts: `` Where the heck's Decatur? There's a <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> almost everywhere, from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ 28 at last count. And the smaller Decaturs have accepted the challenge of the largest to collect food for the poor and put themselves on the map. Local organizers created `` Cans Across The Country'' to see which <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> could collect the most food and provide it to hungry people in each of the communities. The goal is one can of food for each resident _ a potential of about 200,000 cans. `` The real winners will be the recipients of the food,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewellen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Decatur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advantage </ORGANIZATION>, an organization that promotes the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city of about 94,000 residents. `` But every <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> that participates will be a winner because a grass-roots movement with volunteers working for a common good generates a spirit of unity. That makes a community stronger,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Lewellen </PERSON> initially identified nine other cities of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> and two <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> counties, and Mayor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> mailed a white glove to each to begin the competition Memorial Day weekend. The official T-shirt of the contest has a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> map on the front. The question mark in `` Where the heck's Decatur?'' rests in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. But, as word of the contest spread across the country, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials realized their count of 12 Decaturs was short. `` This little town of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> called,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lewellen </PERSON>. `` Decatur townships surfaced. There's even one in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, population 20, except in the summer when it's 100 Many of them do n't even have a zip code.'' Her count rose to 25. The <ORGANIZATION> Decatur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Review did some additional research and identified 28 Decaturs. `` I'm not sure we're through finding Decaturs yet,'' said the mayor. `` But, the more the merrier.'' All are welcome in the contest, which has has been divided into three divisions based on population. There are no prizes, said the mayor, `` just satisfaction and pride.'' Officials from all the Decaturs will be invited to the opening ceremony of Decatur Celebration here Aug. 5. The winners will be announced then, although some <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION> officials figure they have victory wrapped up. `` There's no doubt in my mind,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We've never been beaten at anything. I'll be there to pick up my first-place trophy and to bring y' all some chili and jalapeno peppers. The mayor of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, promised <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> a consolation prize of a pinto bean-and-peanut butter sandwich, and Mayor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said schoolchildren brought 7,000 cans of food in just one day, and `` we're going to beat <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said the contest will increase public awareness about all of the Decaturs _ communities named for <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Decatur </PERSON>, a patriot and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> hero in the War of 1812.

<HEAD>Commission: Cut Spending; Increase Revenues; Lengthen School Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special commission created by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> called Sunday for cuts in federal spending, consideration of tax increases and a longer school year to deal with what it says is the country's economic crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> Cuomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competitiveness </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's leaders should consider a freeze on military spending; taxing Social Security benefits of wealthier Americans; and a reduction of farm subsidies that benefit large producers. The commission also recommmended higher taxes for luxury items and consideration of a $ 10-per-barrel oil import fee and the imposition of a value-added tax on goods and services. The commission said that, if adopted, both the oil import fee and the value-added tax should be structured to insulate the poor. `` The commission believes that future fiscal policy must be based on a combination of reduced spending and increased revenue,'' said the 259-page report from the 20-member task force that included businessmen, labor leaders and economists. The <ORGANIZATION> Cuomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Report is being published as a paperback by <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and Schuster and will be available in book stores as early as Monday, said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, once considered a potential 1988 Democratic presidential candidate, has been pushing economic reform for months. In addition to creating the <ORGANIZATION> Cuomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in January 1987, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governor led the drive for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which was approved by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December. The commission, which is due to report after the November election, is headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Republican </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of transportation. Other members include <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohatyn </PERSON>. The national commission is to prepare recommendations on the national deficit, trade imbalance, Third World debt and productivity _ the same issues dealt with by the <ORGANIZATION> Cuomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` The word ` crisis' has been cheapened by too frequent use, but no other word so well describes <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s present situation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Cuomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> concluded. `` Either <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will implement reforms that strengthen the international trading system and make the nation more competitive at home or it risks a long, slow national decline.'' The major problems facing the nation on the economic front are the trade deficit and the federal deficit, according to the commission. The commission said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must improve its production capabilities, in part through greater employee participation; work to improve living conditions and create new markets in the Third World by, among other things, helping restructure debt payments for developing nations; and stabilize the international monetary system. Repairing roads and bridges was given a high priority by the group as was giving the nation's youth the tools with which to compete. `` We need a longer school year,'' said the commission. `` Japanese students attend school 240 days a year, European students, on average, 220 days. In the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, the average school year is 180 days. ... The shorter school year clearly places <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students at an educational disadvantage.''

<HEAD>US Officer: Speedboat Raid Off Saudi Coast A ``Surprise''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A U.S.-owned supertanker anchored off <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> on Sunday after an Iranian gunboat attack that apparently caught <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by surprise. The 258,979-ton Esso Demetia, which flies the British flag, was about 45 miles off the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> coast when it was ambushed by two or three armed speedboats just before dusk Saturday. Iranian attacks in that area are extremely rare and perhaps unprecedented, said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The attack ignited several fires aboard the supertanker but caused no casualties, said gulf-based shipping executives, speaking on condition of anonymity. The nearest <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warship, the guided missile frigate <PERSON> Halyburton </PERSON>, was 45 miles away, and it would have taken it 1 -LCB- hours to reach the stricken ship. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON>, said that by the time the 3,600-ton frigate met the tanker heading for `` humanitarian assistance,'' the Esso Demetia was sailing toward <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> under its own power, had the fires under control and did not request help. <PERSON> Goforth </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would not speculate further on the attack on the Arab side of the gulf, far from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the customary haunts of its Revolutionary Guard raiders. The supertanker was originally reported to be British-owned, but <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday said it was U.S.-owned, but it did n't know the firm. Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers have said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> appeared to be testing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces following April 18 clashes in which six of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval craft were sunk or disabled. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer speaking on condition of anonymity said the daylight raid on the <PERSON> Esso </PERSON> <PERSON> Demetia </PERSON> was `` a surprise, not something anyone was really looking for.'' `` It's probably supposed to prove they can hit a ship anywhere they want to,'' he said. Available records show that there have been no ship attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the waters immediately north of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and east of <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for several years. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have been fighting since 1980. The Esso Demetia attack was one of two raids on ships in four hours Saturday. A Filipino crewman was killed and two others wounded in the earlier raid on the 11,744-ton West German container ship Dhaulagiri in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, 350 miles to the southeast. Shipping executives said the raids were apparently in retaliation for Iraqi air strikes on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s oil shipping. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed attacks Thursday and Friday but only the first was verified independently. Under recently expanded `` rules of engagement,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships may respond to requests for help from ships under attack in international waters, regardless of what flag they fly. American ships can not help vessels carrying war-related or contraband cargo. Previously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships could defend only U.S.-flagged vessels. Since the tougher policy went into effect May 3, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has carried out six gunboat attacks, all far enough from patrolling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships that they could not intervene. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted a military communique as saying <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> jets shot down an Iranian F-14 Tomcat fighter over the gulf Saturday. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> denied that.

<TEXT>
 Space-age cartoon heroes will never threaten the place of Superman in the heart of this southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> community, which is celebrating the 50th birthday of its hometown boy. `` He's an adopted son, so to speak,'' Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Corzine </PERSON> said Sunday. `` This is about the 10th annual Superman Celebration. He's one of the big highlights for the town. Almost 20,000 people gathered over the weekend in Metropolis for a Superhero birthday party, contests for Superboys, <PERSON> Supergirls </PERSON> and <PERSON> Superdogs </PERSON>, a mock bank robbery and a Superman baseball tournament, <PERSON> Corzine </PERSON> said. Superman arrived on earth from the planet Krypton in Action Comics in February 1938. His alter ego was <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, who worked at the fictional Daily Planet in the imaginary city of Metropolis. The real Metropolis realized during tough economic times in the early 1970s that it was the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city with the name of <PERSON> Superman </PERSON>'s home, so it claimed the Man of Steel for its own. Billboards tout the adopted son on Route 45 at both ends of town; the water tower bears a picture of Superman; a statue of him stands overlooking the main street; the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has a telephone booth where kids can talk to him; and the local newspaper is named The Metropolis Planet. But Superman, or at least the man who's playing him this year, is not a mild-mannered reporter. He's a service manager for the local Chevrolet dealer who acknowledges that donning the Superman outfit is `` a little bit like going outside in your underwear.'' `` It's the kids that make it worthwhile,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, whose 6-foot-5 inch, 230-pound frame fits the comic book image. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, in his second year of playing Superman, said Sunday he had signed about 500 autographs. `` A lot of grandmothers are asking for pictures,'' he said. `` They want a picture taken and an autograph to send to grandkids somewhere.'' <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> stepped out of a police-escorted limousine Thursday night to kick off the celebration in this peaceful <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of 7,200, which rolled out a 5-foot-by-3-foot cake _ enough to supply a piece for every celebrant.

 An estimated 150,000 people will develop AIDS this year, doubling the number of estimated AIDS cases worldwide since the epidemic began, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. `` AIDS is changing the world,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS program. `` It has become a key part of the history of our time.'' He spoke at the opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. The number of AIDS cases officially reported to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> stood at 75,392 on Jan. 12 and 96,433 as of June 1. The number of actual cases is estimated to be 200,000, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. Although AIDS was not identified until 1981, the origins of the epidemic have been traced back to the 1970s. `` A virus spread across the world, and we did n't even know it existed,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. `` It is _ or should be _ shocking to our modern pride that such a global expansion could occur without even being detected.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said the five years after 1981 marked a period of extraordinary discovery, in which the ways in which AIDS spread were identified, the virus was isolated and an AIDS antibody test was developed. <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Kallings </PERSON>, chairman of the AIDS conference, said the meeting allowed scientists to assemble their findings, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, into a large picture of the AIDS epidemic. `` I'm afraid that the picture in its entirety will be frightening,'' he said. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> described the three distinct patterns of AIDS spread that make up the worldwide epidemic. Pattern I, he said, is that seen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the disease appeared first in homosexuals and bisexuals. Heterosexual transmission is growing in those areas, the virus is spreading rapidly among drug abusers through their shared needles, but blood supplies have now been made safe by screening for the virus. Pattern II, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said, characterizes <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, where the AIDS spread has been predominantly among heterosexuals. Pattern III refers to the delayed spread of AIDS in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and most countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Only 1 percent of the AIDS cases reported to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> come from Pattern III countries, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins Monday In Pittsburgh For Heidnik Murder
Trial</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jury selection was sscheduled to begin Monday in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> for the murder trial of a man charged with torturing and raping six women, killing two of them, and whose freezer contained human body parts. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, who is white, is accused of keeping black women chained in the basement of his row house where, survivors have testified, he dug screwdrivers into their ears, raped them almost every day and fed them dog food. Six jurors had been chosen in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> when Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> agreed to a defense request to move jury selection out of town. Those six jurors were dismissed. State Chief Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nix </PERSON> chose <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for jury selection; those chosen will be sequestered for the trial in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The judge ordered the change of jury selection because <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, 44, had his lawyer tell the court he did n't believe he would get a fair shake from Philadelphians. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> has a history of mistreating women, and was confined to maximum-security mental hospital after a 1978 conviction for kidnapping a retarded person he was charged with raping. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> told a judge he had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Defense attorney <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> veteran with a psychiatric disability, was a subject of Army LSD experiments in the mid-1960s that aggravated his schizophrenia. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> says there is nothing in <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s records showing that, but <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> has said he has documents to back up his claim in court. Peruto and the prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>, have been barred by a judge from making any public comments on the case, at least until the jury is chosen. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, self-styled minister of a church he created and operated in his home, also turned out to be a financial whiz, turning $ 35,000 into a stock portfolio worth more than $ 500,000 in 10 years. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> was arrested in March 1987 after a woman told police she had escaped from him. Police said they found three other women, aged 18 to 24 and naked from the waist down, chained in the basement, two to a pipe and the other in a water-filled pit. When they were released they ran into the street crying `` Free at last.'' In a freezer were 24 pounds of human limbs with other body parts in a kitchen refrigerator, police said. The woman who said she escaped later led detectives to a remote forest area in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where they found the body of <PERSON> Debbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 23. Authorities said Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was electrocuted while standing in the water-filled pit when the defendant allegedly touched electric wires to her chains. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> also is accused of killing <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, 24. She died while hanging for days by one hand shackled to a basement pipe, authorities said. District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s arrest that the reason it took so long to arrest him was that, despite complaints from neighbors, police had no probable cause. `` We ca n't go walking into people's houses,'' said Police Inspector <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. `` We ca n't just go kicking in doors and running in.'' In 1986 <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s estranged wife obtained an order prohibiting him from `` physically striking, harrassing or threatening'' her. The document, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> regularly picked up `` black handicapped women for the purpose of having sex with them.'' When neighbors complained in February 1987, a month before his arrest, about a smell coming from his home <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> told police that a pot of meat had burned. `` It's just amazing to me that this could have gone on as long as it did in the city without someone picking it up,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulp </PERSON>, executive director of Women Organized Against Rape.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded with a bit of mimicry when he received a mock congratulatory telegram from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, at a press roast. `` Thank you, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>,'' said the straight-faced recipient. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>? Yes, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, as in <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>, who had an infamous interview with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Republican opponent, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And `` Dan'' as in the name <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly used to refer to his interviewer, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>, on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Nightline'' program last week. It was a night of lampoons Saturday as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was honored by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photographers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor poked fun at his chief rival, selection of a running mate and even himself. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the gathering he took a break that afternoon to go `` to a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> boutique to pick up my speech for tomorrow,'' a tounge-in-cheek jibe at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s characterization of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an elitist. He joked about picking a vice president, pointing a finger down the head table at <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a former linebacker for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION> football team. `` He knows something about defense and I'm interested in conventional defense,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told his receptive _ and laughing _ audience. `` I've been thinking about <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>.'' The unusually festive <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who rarely tries to be funny, accepted the barbs as well as dishing them out. Master of ceremonies <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> presented him with a cardboard presidential seal with a likeness of a cod in place of the bald eagle. He laughed again when another seal was attached to the podium; the sign said the official seal of `` The Next President of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' And he roared when <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> presented him with catalogs and a shopping bag from one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s pricier shops, telling <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> they were for his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, whose penchant for finer clothing contrasts sharply with her husband's love of bargain-basement suits. `` We know you do n't shop,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. The host told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> he had the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> press to thank for helping him develop `` that fine-tuned media style the rest of the nation now finds so riveting and charasmatic.'' For the sake of fairness, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' suburban upbringing and fired back: `` <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> is n't exactly tent city, you know,'' a reference to the vice president's sprawling oceanside summer compound in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> was working her regular shift as a bartender at the Snick-Snack Tap when her dream turned to reality _ she won a piece of a $ 35 million lottery jackpot, the second largest in state history. `` I was just sitting at the bar, comparing my tickets against the number, when I said, ` I got three, I got four, I got, five, I got six,''' Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, 28, said after the Saturday night Lotto drawing. Earlier in the day, Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> had bought $ 10 worth of Lotto tickets along with <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Godinez </PERSON>, 23, her boyfriend's brother, in this west <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. <PERSON> Godinez </PERSON>, a laid-off construction worker and father of two, said Sunday that it did n't take long for news of his good fortune to get around. `` I've had a lot of phone calls. They say, ` Hey, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, you remember me from school, do n't you?' I say, ` No, goodbye.''' The ticket purchased by Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Godinez </PERSON> was one of three winning tickets in the Lotto drawing, which had a guaranteed grand prize for a single winner of $ 35 million, paid in the form of an annuity over 20 years. Since the grand prize money will be divided among three winners, officials wo n't know until Monday how large an annuity each third of the jackpot will buy, said lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rem </PERSON>. They also wo n't be able to confirm the winners until Monday, each of whom faced odds of 12.9 million-to-1 in picking the six winning numbers, Ms. <PERSON> Rem </PERSON> said. The other winning tickets _ which matched the numbers 2, 4, 9, 31, 42 and 45 _ were bought in the south <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> and in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, she said. The $ 35 million <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> jackpot is second only to the $ 40 million Lotto jackpot won by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittkowski </PERSON> on Sept. 1, 1984. Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said Sunday she had not had time to think about what she would do with her winnings, other than `` get my mom a -LRB- new -RRB- house.'' The daughter is single, lives at home with her mother and two brothers, and has worked at the Snick-Snack for about two years. `` This bar is one big family. We all know each other, so when we found out that me and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> had won, it was like the whole family had won,'' she said. `` I have n't been able to sit down and think about what I'm going to do with the money,'' <PERSON> Godinez </PERSON> said. As for the reaction of his brother, <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Godinez </PERSON>, whom Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> has been seeing, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Godinez </PERSON> quipped, `` What else is he going to say but, ` Let's get married?' If he's smart, that's what he'll say.'' Kidding aside, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Godinez </PERSON> said he wo n't have to work any more part-time construction jobs `` to put food on the table'' for his wife and youngsters, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, 3, and <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, 16 months. `` We joke a little, we pray to God a little, and we thank him for what he's given us,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The estate of a cancer victim who worked around asbestos is suing a tobacco company, charging that it failed to warn people the two substances are a dangerous combination. The case of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be the first to come to trial linking tobacco and asbestos, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>, who smoked two packs of Pall Malls daily, worked at shipyard jobs that left him covered with asbestos, jurors were told last week. He died last year at age 55 after smoking since age 11. In 1985, the surgeon general reported that people who work near asbestos are five times as likely to get lung cancer as people who do not come in contact with the substance. Smokers are 10 times more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers. But people who work near asbestos and smoke are 50 times more likely to get cancer than people who do neither, according to the report. Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who is representing <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>' estate, told the eight-member jury during opening arguments Tuesday that <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON> should have been told of the dangerous combination of asbestos and cigarettes The tobacco company should have issued special warnings about the added dangers of smoking for people who work around asbestos, according to the estate, which contends that <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON> never knew of the danger. The estate originally sued about 12 asbestos companies, along with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of Pall Malls. Claims against nine asbestos companies were dismissed and three were settled before the trial began, according to court records. Lawyers would not discuss the terms of the settlements and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> has ordered that jurors not be told about the settlements. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> contends that it was <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>' choice to smoke, despite warnings from friends and relatives that cigarettes were `` cancer sticks.'' `` He is the type of person on whom a warning would have made no difference whatsoever,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mannino </PERSON>, the tobacco company's attorney, in his opening arguments. <PERSON> Mannino </PERSON> argued that the cancer that killed <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON> was a rare type not statistically related to cigarette smoking. The only period for which cigarette makers can be held liable, according to federal court appeals decisions, is prior to 1966. That year, health warnings began to be placed on cigarette packs. <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON> was diagnosed with cancer of the lung, liver and head in 1985. Monday will be the first anniversary of <PERSON> Gunsalus </PERSON>' death at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. His death certificate listed the cause of death as a brain tumor, caused by lung cancer, which led to a fatal drop in blood pressure.

<DATELINE>WILBERFORCE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in an effort to broaden his support among blacks, on Sunday urged the use of federal aid to assist minority businesses. `` I support strongly increased minority development efforts by the federal government: We must bring black Americans and other minorities into the free enterprise system, as we must into the government,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he delivered the commencement address at predominantly black <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The vice president's pledge is a break with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which has opposed state and local programs that set aside a portion of contracts for members of a particular race. The set-asides have been used by federal, state and local governments as a way to remedy past racial discrimination against minority businessmen. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a `` a positive civil rights agenda, one that protects the civil rights of every American,'' but he said the policy must go beyond that to `` knock down the walls of indifference and other barriers that result in economic exclusion.'' The vice president told the 275 <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> graduates they made it thrugh college despite `` poverty, broken homes, inadequate schools, and the social challenges or threat of drugs and violence.'' He urged them to continue taking risks and become among those Americans who create one million businesses a year. `` Risk-taking is the heartbeat of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' he said, and the resulting economic growth lets those just entering the job market `` get a piece of the pie without taking it away from someone who's already there.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, responding to questions from reporters, said he would work to `` broaden the base of our party, talk on the issues that I think transcend black, white, American issues that are out there and are going to appeal.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who celebrated his 64th birthday on Sunday, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. The award was announced last year, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was unable to receive until Sunday, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamness </PERSON>, a spokesman for the university. In honor of the vice president's birthday, a reporter presented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a t-shirt bearing a photo of embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and the inscription, `` What, Me Worry?'' But the vice president refused to show the shirt to reporters during a tour of the neighboring National Afro-American museum prior to the speech. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately with about 20 local dignitaries at the museum and was presented with two paintings by <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> professor whose paintings are on display. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later flew to to <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where he campaigned for Republican congressional candidate <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Arey </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Police Make More Than 1,400 Arrests, Once-Plagued Suburb Lauded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An anti-gang police task force code-named `` The Hammer'' dropped down on the city's streets over the weekend, making nearly 1,400 arrests and recovering drugs and firearms. Meanwhile, the suburban city of Paramount was cited by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> as one of 10 `` All-American Cities'' for its efforts to defeat street gangs. The police sweep conducted Friday and Saturday nights throughout the city resulted in issuance of hundreds of misdemeanor warrants, seizures of small quantities of drugs and impoundment of several automobiles, authorities said.. Officers also gathered intelligence, filling out hundreds of field identifications forms of suspected and known gang members for future reference The actions are major skirmishes in what Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> calls a war on `` the rotten little cowards,'' and followed the release of a department report showing gang slayings had risen 20 percent this year. The report cited 96 gang-related killings in the city this year through the end of May, compared to 80 in the same period a year ago. In all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> there have been 138 gang-related killings this year. In 1987, gang slayings totaled 387 countywide. Authorities estimate there are as many as 70,000 gang members in the city and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Along with confiscations of rock or crack cocaine and the hallucinogenic drug PCP, several weapons were confiscated, including an AK-47 assault rifle, said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatreau </PERSON>. The city of Paramount, southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was named Saturday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The citation noted that earlier, this decade, the suburb was faced with urban problems and a high crime rate that put it on a list of 14 cities around the country labeled `` disaster areas.'' But since then, 2,900 youths have participated in an `` Alternative To Gang Membership'' program in six years, and only 15 were later identified by authorities as gang members. About 1,700 properties have been cleaned up by more than 980 volunteers who donated more than 4,800 hours of labor, while an active civilian `` Neighborhood Watch'' program freed county sheriff's deputies for more patrol duties.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> welcomes a Soviet suggestion on a conventional arms treaty with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but only as a starting point for future negotiations, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s spokesman said Sunday. `` This will have to be looked at very closely, but it does show a new thinking in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' spokesman <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was referring to remarks by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> last week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> indicating the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance was ready to make cuts in its conventional forces that would not have to be matched equally by the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. At a conference on <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> security Saturday in <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said he greeted the apparent change in the Kremlin's position. `` This speech in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- by <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> -RRB- is welcomed because now it has been clearly stated that everywhere there is an -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- advantage, asymmetrical cuts will have to be made,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said at the three-day conference that ended Saturday. `` This is very important for us in view of the superiority by the Eastern side in large-scale equipment -LRB- such as tanks -RRB-,'' he added. Earlier in the <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> conference, other Soviet officials said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact was ready to make asymmetrical cuts in its tank force, but they linked such reductions with elimination of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s advantages in fighter aircraft and attack helicopters <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON> said <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> was pleased with the Soviet statements on conventional arms `` but these are matters which we have to analyze further'' along with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. During the <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION> conference the Soviet deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aboymov </PERSON>, outlined the latest Soviet proposals calling for a three-stage reduction of conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the first stage would be an elimination of force imbalances between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, followed by a reduction of 500,000 troops on each side and then restructuring the remaining forces to give them a defensive rather than offensive capability.

<TEXT>
 Product directions often seem simple. `` Press firmly'' is a typical instruction. But how firmly? Design engineers at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> are researching ways to make such orders more specific. They began after learning that owners of homes with a certain kind of gas valve were asked to test them by pressing a knob firmly without forcing it; with no more than those directions, the owners were expected to determine whether their valves were defective and possibly dangerous. `` The goal of the research is the ability to craft phrases that will produce well-defined physical responses,'' said Professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreifeldt </PERSON>. A graduate student in design engineering at <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kodali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> V.N </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, developed an experiment to see if product directions could be made more simple. `` From nail polish to computers, cameras to hair sprays and toasters to tanks, the designer needs to be well-informed about the consequences resulting from use or misuse of the product,'' said <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>. `` As designers, we have to decide that a switch should work with a certain amount of force.'' But how does one go about communicating that, he wondered. In his research, he asked about 240 people to squeeze a device attached to a meter, either gently or hard. The results varied considerably. The instruction `` firm'' covered a range of two kilograms to 32 kilograms of force. The project's most surprising result: when the instructions were changed to `` squeeze not very hard and not too gently,'' the test participants were remarkably consistent. Ninety percent of the participants applied 12.9 to 14.6 kilograms of force. <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> said that the word `` not'' in instructions causes people to be more cautious about how much pressure they exert. `` Force is a perceivable thing that people can use through experience,'' said <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>. `` One thing is sure: one-word instructions do n't convey enough information. If you say ` Do this,' people tend to get carried away by presuppositions, so it is important to give users parameters.''

 As many as 60 children may have eluded social workers who rounded up and removed residents of a boarding home under investigation for abuse, the state <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> chief said Sunday. But state Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said he was unsure how many children may have been left behind when students from the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children near <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION> were removed Friday by the workers armed with a court order. `` There are still a whole lot of kids out there wandering around somewhere that were released through a totally inappropriate manner,'' <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said at a Sunday news conference. He said 66 children had been taken into custody, including a runaway brought to a state mental institution, early Sunday morning. The children were rounded up near the campus of the 28-acre home, at restaurants and along roadways. Even as welfare workers continued trying to reunite some of the youngsters with their familes, the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, the home's operator, said he was sheltering four or five youngsters who fled the home before the workers arrived `` I've still got a few soldiers left, and I'm trying to work back to what it was before,'' said <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, 38, who established the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> home 10 years ago as what he calls a last refuge for troubled kids. <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> says he is a former heroin addict, and his experiences on the streets of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> qualify him to work with such children. Fountain's comments drew a tight-lipped response from the judge who ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to remove children from the home that has come under criticism intermittently since 1980. `` I'll deal with it, but I'll deal with it Monday,'' Chancery Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home. A court hearing is set for Monday morning in <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION> to decide where the children taken from <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> will be placed. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said `` between 10 and 15'' children already had been released to their parents. The commissioner said he was satisfied with the state's handling of the situation and was not worried that some parents might want to sue the state for removing the children. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> ruled Friday that children at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> _ who range in age from 10 to 17 and are mostly from outside <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ were subjected `` to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention amounting to imprisonment.'' He ordered their immediate removal. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON>, who supervised the children's removal from the home, said Saturday that medical examinations of some children showed excessive use of corporal punishment. As for the children who have returned to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> since Friday, <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said, `` We'll work with the court on that and follow the court's direction on that.'' There have been estimates that 120 to 160 children were at the home. Fountain refused to provide the court a list with names and addresses of the children and their parents. Fountain vowed Saturday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION> to continue to keep open <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>'s doors and said he had taken in another resident, a teen-age boy, despite the judge's Friday order. `` To tell you the truth, I do n't know how that court order reads,'' he said. Charges that he enslaved and beat children are half-truths, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. The children were brought to him precisely because they needed strong discipline and hard work to set them on a spiritual path. `` The parents have lost control. Kids today are such manipulators. Such cons. Especially a child from a divorce. They've learned how to manipulate their parents,'' the independent Baptist minister said `` The children are here mainly for runaways, stealing, homosexuality. We have little girls who were whores,'' he said. `` They need a little discipline, a little bit of hard work. We give them the Bible, not that trash they read, not rock' n' roll. They are going to do work when they are here.'' Fountain believes the state welfare department is in conspiracy against him, a conspiracy that runs so deep, those involved are unaware. The conspiracy is based on the principles of humanism, an anathema to his own fundamentalist beliefs and his advocacy of separation between church and state, he claims. The conspiracy's aim, he said, is to set up licensing laws for church-run homes, something he insists he will never submit to.

<TEXT>
 Presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Sunday called President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-drug programs `` chaos'' and promised the nation's mayors a tough program to curb drug use and trafficking that would include the possible use of military force. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who has enough delegates to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, called for stronger drug laws and stringent sentencing guidelines, but stopped short of endorsing capital punishment for major dealers, which apparent Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports. `` My friends, we can win the war against drugs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, where he picked up endorsements from more than 500 Democratic mayors. `` But we have to recognize that it is war _ a war of wills, a war of values, a war of confidence and courage and strength,'' he said in his speech to the mayors. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also reiterated his pledge to raise taxes only as a last resort, and told the mayors he welcomed their suggestions on potential running mates. `` A lot of people are going to be considered,'' he told reporters prior to the speech. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> touted a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program that brings drug education to students and teachers and involves police and local celebrities, promising to establish a similar national program if elected. He said a national program should have the goal of ridding the nation's schools of drugs by the 1990s and guaranteeing immediate treatment for addicts. `` Now some may say that goal is too ambitious, that we'll never make it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But if we do n't set ambitious goals for our young people and for our nation, how are we ever going to win this war?'' In a scathing indictment of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-drug effort, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the president has failed to back up his tough rhetoric and has undermined the war on drugs by cutting the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget, by slashing federal aid to state and local police, by failing to appoint a federal drug Czar, and by dealing with suspected drug runners _ particularly <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` What we have today is chaos,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We've got to back up what we say with what we do.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised the mayors to beef up federal law enforcement staffs and to increase federal aid to state and local police, although he did not suggest a specific dollar amount when asked by reporters. He also said, `` We've got to move the war against narcotics from the bottom to the top of our foreign policy agenda.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that if elected he would issue an executive order prohibiting the payment of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> or other government funds to suspected drug dealers. `` Never again, never again are you going to bankroll a drug peddler who is poisoning our society and killing are children,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He also said he would use increased amounts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid for crop eradication and other drug interdiction efforts, including the protection of politicians, police and judges in drug-producing countries whose lives are threatened by drug kingpins. The military should be prepared to assist in such efforts, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who again did not provide specific dollar figures on the foreign aid proposal. `` It will take tough, sustained and unrelenting enforcement, on the ground, in the air and at sea _ at home and abroad,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Enforcement which uses the military where appropriate and necessary.'' He also chided <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for not working with Latin American leaders to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, saying such cooperation was vital to stopping the flow of cocaine and marijuana into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> mayors and later was holding a private session with a smaller group of black mayors. He was returning to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Sunday night and was to meet Monday with congressional leaders and law enforcement officials from several states to discuss drug issues.

<TEXT>
 Fifteen thousand people rallied Sunday in support of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, one day after the jailed black South African leader's birthday was celebrated with a huge pop music concert <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` Our time has come,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid activist, told the crowd at a <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> park. `` They have thrown us in prison, murdered us, assaulted us and tried to intimidate us into silence so that you would forget,'' the mixed-race church leader said to a standing ovation. The rally was the second part of the `` Freedom at 70 Campaign'' marking <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s 70th birthday July 18. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has been jailed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 25 years. He was convicted in 1964 on charges of sabotage and conspiracy to topple the government and sentenced to life in prison. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is the largest black guerrilla group fighting to overthrow that country's white-dominated government of President P.W <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and dismantle the system of apartheid. On Saturday, more than 70,000 fans jammed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> for a 10-hour rock concert by top international pop stars, whose music was interspersed with denunciations of apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of racial separation. It was the biggest charity rock concert since the 1985 `` Live Aid'' famine-relief extravaganza. Because of its political message, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> came under heavy criticism for broadcasting the entire event. But the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said it regarded the concert as a musical, not a political, program. Modeled on Live Aid's `` global jukebox'' to aid starving Africans, the concert was beamed by radio and television to an estimated 750 million people in 60 countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, organizers said. Among the 40 or so performers were Sting, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Flack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Eurythmics </ORGANIZATION>, the Bee Gees, Wet Wet Wet and Dire Straits.

<HEAD>Hooligans Abroad: Britain Tries To Salvage Its Overseas Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The image of the British traveler, once a model of courtesy and reserve, has apparently been given a black eye by a new breed of bad-mannered Britons. So the government, worried about its hooligans abroad, has launched a television advertising campaign aimed at salvaging the stiff-upper-lip image of its citizens overseas. `` It is a fact that over the years, particularly where the British are going in vast numbers on holidays, there are problems,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman explained Sunday. Those problems include Britons who wind up in trouble with the local law as well as crimes committed against British tourists. `` Those figures have gone up enormously,'' the spokesman said anonymously, in keeping with British practice. British sports fans following their teams to games on the Continent have run into serious trouble with police. Because of violence at soccer games, British soccer clubs have been barred from European Cup competition since 1985. The Foreign Office decided to launch the summer advertising campaign in two weeks to back up its leaflet called `` Get It Right Before You Go.'' It will urge travelers to take out proper insurance and remind them to abide by the laws of their host country during their stay. Foreign Office Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> this week to inspect arrangements being made to handle the annual flood of British tourists to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> beach resorts.

 An examination of dozens of untended bodies found in a funeral home turned up at least one that dates back to 1978, authorities said. The medical examiners office said Saturday that it had identified 49 of 70 sets of remains discovered at the <ORGANIZATION> Howell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapel </ORGANIZATION>, which had the city contract for handling the bodies of indigents. But Chief Medical Examiner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON> said some may never be identified. `` There will be about 10 that no matter what we do we will not be able to identify them. One does n't have a head or legs, so even if we had a dental chart, what could we do?'' he said. The first two bodies were found during a routine state inspection, and 42 more were found during last week, many of them stacked in a closet, a police officer said. In addition, 26 boxes containing cremated ashes were discovered. Bodies were identified through death certificates noting <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>'s funeral home, legible hospital bracelets, medical examiner's toe tags, or medical appliances such as hip pins, said <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON>. The oldest remains were identified through a 1978 death certificate, <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON> said. Officials have not released the names of those identified and have not contacted family members. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> suspended owner <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>'s license last week. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> has said the bodies were being held because of procedural problems with paperwork, not because of money problems. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> was called Sunday for additional comment, but could not be reached. Officials plan to bring in heavy equipment to dig up the yard behind the funeral home, but <PERSON> Lipkovic </PERSON> doubts any bodies will be found. `` With a free graveyard nearby, that would n't make sense,'' he said, referring to Hillside Cemetery, the city's burial grounds for indigents.

 About 2,000 people rallied Sunday outside the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> apartment of Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesz </PERSON> and shouted anti-government slogans. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, police detained two men who were tossing leaflets and demanding the release of jailed draft resisters, opposition spokesman <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosakowski </PERSON> reported. He said <PERSON> Gwido </PERSON> <PERSON> Zlatkes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tomasz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleb </PERSON> of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> organization climbed scaffolding on a main street near the <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> and threw some 1,500 leaflets to the crowd below. <PERSON> Kosakowski </PERSON> said many in the crowd, which he estimated to number about 1,000, hooted and jeered police who tried to remove the two from the scaffold. Zlatkes and <PERSON> Gleb </PERSON> climbed down about five minutes later and were immediatelsy detained, according to <PERSON> Kosakowski </PERSON>. He said the leaflets listed 16 people as being imprisoned for refusing mandatory military service, including <PERSON> Slawomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutkiewicz </PERSON>, 24. Freedom and Peace has said <PERSON> Dutkiewicz </PERSON> has been on a hunger strike since being jailed seven months ago and is being force-fed in prison. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a telephone interview he was surprised by the rally that developed after an outdoor Mass near his apartment in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city. The demonstrators marched to his apartment building shouting `` We want <PERSON> Lech </PERSON>, not Wojciech!'' and `` No freedom without Solidarity!'' Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> is the communist government's premier. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in the interview that he had not attended the Mass and decided to address the crowd when many people shouted they would boycott elections June 19 for municipal and provincial councils. `` I said that the generals should know that was what people are really thinking. I said that because we are not being noticed, we should prepare ourselves for August in order to lead <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> into a real road of reforms,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in the interview. Solidarity was chartered by the government as the first free trade union in the Soviet bloc following nationwide strikes in August 1981. It was suspended in December 1981 and subsequently outlawed. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> joined in a strike May 2-10 at the Lenin shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where he works as an electrician. The strike ended without a settlement and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said later that unless authorities initiate a dialogue with Solidarity, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can expect more strikes, probably in August.

 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s family expressed optimism Sunday that the church envoy will be freed by his Lebanese captors despite a book claiming <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> planned to use him in a death plot against <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> reacted to the report by saying it revealed the `` real ugly face'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and it accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of official terrorism. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, brother of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> envoy, called the allegations in the book `` mischievous.'' But he added: `` We are very optimistic about the eventual outcome of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s situation. The big question is the timing of it. `` We are probably now in the most positive era we have ever been in, as far as this situation is concerned. ... We just have to wait and pray, as we have been doing all along, that we will eventually see a good outcome.'' The book, `` Best Laid Plans, The Inside Story of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s War Against Terrorism,'' was written by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walcott </PERSON>, national security correspondent for The Wall Street Journal. An excerpt printed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report alleged that <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, planned to ask <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> to go to <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> to meet <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in 1986 to seek help in freeing hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The article alleged that <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s visit would be timed to ensure that <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was in his compound when the Americans launched their bombing raid on the Libyan capital April 15, 1986. According to the book, the idea was to increase the chances of <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> being killed in the raid. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s official <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> news agency, in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said, `` The plot revealed today and the ones before it which included <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official terrorism and subversion represent the style of smugglers and heads of gangsters.'' It added: `` Every day the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration reveals its real ugly face showing that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has become the official center of the administration of terrorism and subversive plots, assassination and aggression against other peoples in a manner never seen before in contemporary political history.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ordered the bombings of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> after accusing <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> of supporting international terrorism. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> said: `` I think it is mischievous of people to put things like this -LRB- the alleged <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> plot -RRB- into books just to add a bit of spice to them. `` They are talking about a person -LRB- <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> -RRB- who is not in a position at the moment to defend himself,'' he added. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> said his brother always `` made it very clear he was not in any way associated with anything underhand or sinister. `` He was and still is a humanitarian working for the Archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> as an envoy on properly humanitarian grounds.'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was apparently unharmed in the bombing, although there were rumors that the attack left him confused and disoriented. Libyan officials reported that his 15-month old adopted daughter was killed and two young sons were wounded. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 while on a mission to help win the release of foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Seventeen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held captive by Islamic extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostage held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

North, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, has retired from the military and is awaiting trial on charges stemming from the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He was fired from his <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> job in November 1986, when the diversion became public.

The furor was intensified when <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reprinted the piece as an advertising supplement in some 250,000 copies of the paper. When the controversy erupted late last week, the newspaper issued an apology but said it was too late to withdraw the special inserts. In addition, The <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> printed an apology on Page 3 of the Sunday paper, and <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> apologized in an advertisment in the Globe sports section. Last week, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochs </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulzberger </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, sent <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> a written apology. The article quoted a fictitious member of the 106-year-old club in the 1880s as saying, `` It's getting so you ca n't walk around <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> without tripping over a drunken Kerryman. If we are to preserve our way of life we must have somewhere to go on weekends... with a high fence to keep the Irish out. The article was apparently intended as humor and written satirically from the perspective of a historical scholar. It contained absurdities about the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> role in building the country club such as this: `` Of course they had to employ Irish laborers to do the heavy work, but they employed an English construction superintendent who contracted laryngitis from constantly shouting ` Green side up!' while the workers were sodding the golf course ...'' The protesters gathered Sunday on <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a peninsula off the predominantly <LOCATION> Irish-American </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and threw about 20 copies of Golf Digest into the harbor. They also called for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to ban <PERSON> Dobereiner </PERSON> from the grounds of the Open. The magazines were later retrieved so as not to litter the harbor. `` We have a right to expect that the Globe would not showcase an article that was blatantly racist,'' said <PERSON> Kieran </PERSON> <PERSON> Staunton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> editor of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly newspaper that first drew attention to the article. Globe spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulla </PERSON> said Sunday retrieving all copies of the ad would have been impossible, because it was contained in a section of the paper delivered a week in advance to retail stores and distributors. Those sections are later sold along with the news pages. An unspecified number of copies of the offending advertisement were retrieved, he said. Only 250,000 of the Globe's 800,000 Sunday papers included the article because <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> wanted to reach a targeted audience, <PERSON> Gulla </PERSON> said.

 A weakening 26-year-old woman awaiting a life-saving liver transplant lived in a pickup truck with her parents for five days before authorities finally moved them into dormitory rooms Sunday. <PERSON> Pollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smolenski </PERSON>, who is suffering from a rare liver disorder called primary biliary cirrhosis, and her parents, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ersley </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON>, said they are down to their last $ 150, nearly half of which is needed for their drive home to <PERSON> Hallie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` The truck was hot and, you know, there's not a lot of room in there,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smolenski </PERSON> said as she rested on a dormitory bunk at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. `` When it gets hot ... I just get weaker and weaker.'' The family lived in a camper atop their pickup in an empty parking lot on the Pitt campus. They said they bathed with wet sponges and used public toilets in nearby hospitals and dormitories. They said they moved into the truck Tuesday after Mrs. <PERSON> Smolenski </PERSON> was discharged from <LOCATION> Presbyterian-University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, the world's leading transplant center Officials said the woman entered the hospital for evaluation May 17 and is awaiting a liver transplant. `` Her life's at stake here,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON>, 51. `` We ca n't take her home again It's too far. They do n't want her more than 30 minutes away in case they get a liver for her. And we know no one in this town.'' <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON>, 54, a disabled equipment operator, carried a hospital beeper in his shirt pocket in case a donor is found. Mrs. <PERSON> Smolenski </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, recently returned home to take care of their three young children. She said he is unemployed. Campus policeman <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said he called university officials Sunday when temperatures rose to the mid-80s and the family said their daughter was growing weaker in the heat. University officials put up the family, at least for one night, in adjacent rooms of a dormitory. Mrs. <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> said social workers have been trying to find a temporary apartment for the family. Liver transplant patients often wait months for donor organs to become available. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffield </PERSON> said officials were unaware the family lacked adequate housing. `` They had told us they had a camper and they did not tell us they needed housing. We would have done something,'' she said. Miss <PERSON> Duffield </PERSON> said the hospital will find a free apartment for the family.

 Gold coins and uncorked bottles of champagne were among the treasures from four shipwrecks, including the Titanic's sister ship, sold at auction Sunday. Recovered items from the R.M.S. Republic, the Spanish galleon <PERSON> Atocha </PERSON>, the `` Good Luck Wreck'' <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> and the Dutch trade ship Geldermalsen were sold at the Museum of Yachting. About 500 people attended Sunday's auction to bid on such items as the blue-and-white porcelain recovered from the Geldermalsen. Among the items from the Republic were cut glass decanters and the helm wheel. The Titanic's sister ship, the Republic sank off the coast of <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in 1909. On sale from the <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> were navigation lights and bottles of champagne and scotch. About 300 bottles of liquor were brought up from the boat in salvage operations last fall before cold weather halted the operation. Workers said several thousand bottles remain underwater. The ship was dubbed the `` Good Luck Wreck'' because of the large number of horseshoes found on board.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s Socialists failed to win a majority in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections and must form a coalition or attempt to govern with a minority. With returns lacking only from territories in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the Socialists and the conservative parties were in a near dead heat, but only the Socialists were in a position to form a governing coalition in the 577-seat assembly. At least 289 seats are needed for a majority. With nine districts still undecided, the Socialists won 272 seats and the Communists 26. The conservative Rally for the Republic won 126 seats, the center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> 129 and minor rightists 14 for a total of 269. The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> won one seat. Its leader, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, was defeated in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> could form a coalition with the Communists or try to lure centrists away from the rightist camp. `` <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> does not have a majority, therefore we won,'' declared <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Toubon </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Rally for the Republic. `` The ball is in his camp. It is up to him to manage his defeat.'' But <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The right is beaten. It will not win a majority of seats. Only the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is in a position to constitute a parliamentary majority.'' <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said it was out of the question that his party would participate in a Socialist government. He said the Communists would support bills it approved and fight `` everything that goes against its interests.'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lecanuet </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, did not say whether any of his centrist forces would be prepared to participate in a coalition with the Socialists. `` Personally, I hope that the French get a government made up of the best,'' he said. `` I wonder if the time has not come for national union.'' <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, former center-right president, said the results showed the French did not want one party to have all the power. `` That is a good thing. They tried to say, ` we want the two halves of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to work together,''' he said Only 122 of the seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, were filled in the first round of the election June 5. Sunday's runoffs were in the 453 districts where no candidate won a majority the first time. A first round of voting also was held for two seats from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION>. Voter turnout was estimated at 71 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1986, when the conservatives won control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has been forced into an uncomfortable `` cohabitation'' with the right. Following his re-election last month with a 54 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> dissolved the Assembly and called elections three years early to win a majority. In the first round, the two main conservative parties won 77 seats, the Socialists 40, the minor rightist parties four and the Communists one. Pre-election polls predicted a large Socialist majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, but the conservatives received more votes in round one. The Socialists and Communists concluded a second-round agreement in which both parties supported the leading leftist candidate in each district and withdrew the weaker candidate to prevent splitting the vote. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermier </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, reiterated that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> support for Socialist candidates in some districts did not mean approval of Socialist policies. `` We will judge them by their acts,'' said <PERSON> Hermier </PERSON>. The two main conservative parties already backed a single candidate. But in the few districts in which a far-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> candidate was leading, the traditional rightist candidate withdrew, and vice versa. The main conservative parties denied there was any deal with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, accused by most politicians of being racist and xenophobic. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said recently that it was unhealthy for the country to be run by one party alone, but his effort to open his government to non-Socialists largely failed. Candidates on the right also spoke of ending the traditional right-left confrontation.

 A proposed major Presbyterian statement on nuclear war was revised Sunday to say a Christian `` normally'' should support the government and nuclear deterrence is immoral `` as an end in inself.'' A writing team working over the weekend on `` Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age'' made the changes, which a subcommittee then adopted. The changes will be presented to a full committee Monday, and the 200th <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB- is scheduled to take up the paper Tuesday. Also on the agenda when 630 delegates of the nation's largest Presbyterian body return to work Monday are the election of a top denominational officer and a host of other issues, including pornography, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s treatment of Palestinians in occupied territories and religious freedom. The subcommittee of 18 people, including lay, clergy, youth and seminary advisory delegates, generally adopted the work of the writing committee Sunday. The writing panel had been charged with making the paper's policy statement and background agree with the revised recommendations made by the subcommittee earlier Those changes included removing language that would strengthen corporate church support for tax resisters and other government protesters and soften language declaring nuclear deterrence immoral. The changes shifted some words to play down discussion of tax resistance and added language saying Christian obedience to civil authority `` is normally the case.'' A paragraph was also added recognizing military service as a legitimate Christian response. The revised policy statement also retains condemnation of nuclear war as immoral. But the original declaration of nuclear deterrence as being immoral was altered to add the phrase `` as an end in itself.'' The proposed policy statement now says: `` The policy of nuclear deterrence has been in danger of becoming an end in itself rather than an interim measure of self-defense. Such a policy as an end in itself is not morally defensible. The work for peaceful alternatives needs to be vigorously pursued.'' Supporters of the initial paper said they expect the full assembly <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peacemaking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> to restore some of the original language. While opponents of the paper agreed that was possible, `` whatever they do to the document, it needs to be sent for prayerful consideration'' by the church instead of adopted as a policy, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, president of Presbyterians for Democracy and Religious Freedom. A nominating committee's decision not to include an incumbent as a candidate for a top denominational office caught the assembly by surprise Saturday afternoon. There were indications commissioners would face a contested election when they vote Tuesday. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 60, has been stated clerk or interim co-stated clerk of the denomination since it was formed in 1983 by the reunion of the Northern and Southern branches of the Presbyterian church. Previously, he held the same office in the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> -RRB-, the Southern church, for 10 years. The committee nominated <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a popular former moderator _ or chief spokesman _ for the $ 62,000-a-year job. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> has said his name will be placed in nomination from the assembly floor when voting begins. In addition, the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, a local church executive from <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, will be nominated from the floor. Other committee recommendations include a call for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its 20-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked to stop sending aid which is used to subsidize Israeli settlement of the territories.

 <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> and the other gorillas in a new `` rain forest'' at <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> seemed to take it in stride when the general public was admitted to the attraction for the first time. Thousands of people streamed into the Ford African Rain Forest after a ribbon-cutting ceremony Saturday to strain for a look at Willie B., the zoo's biggest star, in the lush open-air habitat which replaced the cage he occupied for 27 years. The 450-pound gorilla, now about 30 years old, immediately came to the edge of a restraining moat to strut for the crowd; once, he ran down a grassy slope, drawing applause. On each side, across moats, two families of gorillas recently brought to the zoo kept a greater distance from onlookers but remained mostly in the open and not in their shelters. Zoo Director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> said the gorillas, while physically separated, have interacted in the 2 -LCB- weeks they have been together. `` They're vocalizing, they're beating their chests, they're moving this way and influencing the others,'' Maple said `` The behavior of animals is enhanced by the presence of others.'' Zoo Business Manager <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said a record for paid attendance at the zoo was set Saturday, and broken Sunday. Sunday's crowd was 11,860, with 10,893 paid, passing the mark of 8,522 set Saturday, when there were also nearly 5,000 free admissions The zoo's best attendance was 17,000 in 1986 when there was free admission to celebrate <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>.'s birthday, but the record paid attendance before Saturday was about 7,400, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The four-acre, $ 4.5 million rain forest, boosted by $ 1 million donated by the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is the centerpiece of a renovation of the 99-year-old zoo, dubbed one of the 10 worst in the country by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> only four years ago. Three gorilla families, including the two already present, are being provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Yerkes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The exhibit includes an adjacent aviary, featuring birds from the same areas of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> inhabited by the gorillas. It is the second of 10 habitats planned; a flamingo habitat opened first. Next year, <PERSON> Maple </PERSON> said, the zoo will present an east African savanna, featuring lions and elephants and including a pool deep enough for an elephant to immerse itself.

 Some 15,000 people packed inside and around a church applauded <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> demands Sunday that the communist government permit more Roman Catholic bishops and priests. In the first ceremony of its kind since 1973, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representative Archbishop <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Colasuonno </PERSON> consecrated <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokol </PERSON> as a bishop and apostolic administrator of the archdiocese of <LOCATION> Trnava </LOCATION>. The archdiocese is known as the `` Rome of <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>'' because of its many historic churches. In a 20-minute sermon interrupted at least two dozen times by applause, <PERSON> Colasuonno </PERSON> called for bishops to fill the vacancies in nine of the nation's 13 dioceses and more religious education. `` Religious life must regain its full rights in a secular society,'' he said. `` Only if it has its rightful place can it contribute to the progress and welfare of the citizens.'' The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> emissary indicated Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> wants much more than the authorities' approval of the appointment of <PERSON> Sokol </PERSON> and of two assistant bishops who were consecrated in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> on Saturday. `` We hope that the negotiatons of the Holy See with all bodies... will bring further results,'' said <PERSON> Colasuonno </PERSON>, speaking in Slovak Negotiations between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and government are continuing. `` This work ... should not end with the appointment of bishops, but should go much further,'' he said. After his consecration the 54-year-old <PERSON> Sokol </PERSON> said, `` I am sure that this was the first step and that others will follow. The vacant bishops' sees will soon be filled with good bishops according to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' heart.'' There was light applause as the government representatives entered the church for the ceremony. They sat unsmiling as <PERSON> Colasuonno </PERSON> expressed the church's demands for more rights. `` Believers have the right to have well-prepared and educated priests'' and orders of nuns and monks need more freedom to recruit new members, the archbishop said. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> primate, 88-year-old Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>, has taken a tougher stand with communist authorities in recent months. In January, he gave unprecedented backing to a petition demanding religious freedom. Copies of the petitions have been signed by an estimated 600,000 people in this country with a population of 15.5 million. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> presided at the consecration of the two assistant bishops for his <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> archdiocese at Saturday's ceremony. After the ceremony several hundred people gathered outside <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s and chanted demands for more religious freedom. In <LOCATION> Trnava </LOCATION>, about 4,000 people were crowded into the church for the ceremony Sunday and at least 11,000 gathered outside and listened to the service carried by loudspeakers. <PERSON> Sokol </PERSON> was consecrated as a full bishop. But for the archdiocese that is normally headed by an archbihop he officially serves as an apostolic administrator.

 Former soldiers loyal to deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> raided a military armory in a failed attempt to free colleagues jailed for past coup attempts, the military said. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, said the group got away with 24 automatic rifles in their Saturday attack. <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said they had intended to free <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON>, a former army colonel, provincial governor and assemblyman who was close to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> when he was president. <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON> has been jailed at suburban Camp Crame for more than a year on charges he ordered the killing of several supporters of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> during the 1986 presidential election that ended <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year reign. The military also announced that it filed murder and kidnapping charges against a Swede, a West German and a Filipino of German descent who were arrested in a rebel-infested area on Wednesday. They were accused of taking part in a raid by communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas on a town southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in February. Two people were killed and two soldiers were abducted in the raid. Also Saturday, a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> judge ruled that assets held by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> must be returned to his homeland. No figures were given, but the assets involved were believed to be a small part of the $ 1 billion that <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials believe <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> channeled into Swiss bank accounts before he fled to exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was living in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, said Saturday that he was leaving the possibility of an appeal to his lawyers. The raid occurred at Camp Crame, the constabulary's national headquarters. Most of the 160 detainees there are soldiers accused of common crimes, but at least 34 of them are accused of taking part in coup attempts against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said troops were prepared for the raid because of intelligence reports earlier that `` <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> loyalists'' would try to free <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON>. He did not elaborate. He said the raiders broke into one office of the armory and stole some weapons, then sped toward the jail compound in a van and a car but were fired on by sentries who spotted them. The raiders immediately withdrew and were engaged in a brief gunfight by other soldiers near the camp's gym, <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Cris </PERSON> <PERSON> Maralit </PERSON>, a constabulary spokesman, said some of the raiders were believed hit in the exchange, but no casualty figures given. A few hours later, troops were placed on maximum alert nationwide, but officials said the move was not related to the Camp Crame incident. They said the alert was a routine measure to prevent disruption of Sunday's celebration of the 90th anniversary of the declaration of Philippine independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Late Saturday, the army chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, described the Camp Crame incident as an isolated one meant to embarrass the government two days before Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> departs for visits to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` We would like to appeal to our people not to be disturbed by what happened at Camp Crame,'' he told reporters. `` I am very confident that our commanders who are tasked ... to protect public safety will be able to do their job.'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Galido </PERSON>, chief of the military's <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luzon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that murder and kidnapping charges against two Europeans and a Filipino were filed Friday before a civil court in <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province. He claimed his command had `` heavy evidence'' against the Rev. <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, 52, a West German Protestant minister; <PERSON> Stellan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON>, 30, a Swede who says he is a free-lance journalist; and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON>, a Filipino businessman. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON> was the organization's president. It said he arrived in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> on May 18 to gather information for lectures and was to have returned to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> Saturday. <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON> and the two others were being held at the command headquarters in <LOCATION> Lucena </LOCATION>, 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Hernani </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said the charges stem from a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> raid on the <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> province town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> last February in which two police officers were killed and two soldiers abducted The soldiers, who eventually escaped, identified <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> as being with the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> raiders, <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON> denied the charges, said <PERSON> Eha </PERSON> <PERSON> Arg </PERSON>, first secretary of the Swedish embassy. He visited <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON> on Saturday. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Hermansson </PERSON> -RRB- denies the charges, because he was not in the country in February,'' Ms. <PERSON> Arg </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. A West German embassy officer visited <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> but could not be contacted for comment because the mission was closed on the weekend. The military has accused the three of helping train communist guerrillas.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> proclaimed a decade of nationalism Sunday and urged Filipinos to be steadfast in the struggle against `` forces at home and abroad'' who want to keep the country poor and subservient.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Godspell' Opens at the Lamb's Theater</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seventeen years after it first opened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` Godspell'' has come home with its simplicity, good humor and joyous sense of wonder intact. The production, which arrived Sunday at the Lamb's Theater, is not so much a revival as a repolishing of the original material while adding bits and pieces from today's follies and foibles to bring it up to date. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is here. So are <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. Even Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> gets into the act, although he and the other names from current events are not the essential part of the story. The musical remains a carefully crafted piece of street theater that seeks to instruct if not convert. The book, devised by <PERSON> John-Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tebelak </PERSON>, follows the Gospel According to <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, reinterpreting the live of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as well as the parables he told. <PERSON> Tebelak </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is a clown, a harlequin with a heart painted on his forehead and a big red Superman `` S'' on his chest. He's a teacher and his lessons come right from <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>'s version of the Bible. He reinterprets many of the most famous parables such as the prodigal son. That reinterpretation is accomplished through a series of vaudeville turns directed with a sure sense of style and wit by <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON>. There's low comedy, high camp and just about every type of dumb joke in between. But the concoction works, primarily because of <PERSON> Scardino </PERSON>'s inventiveness and the exuberant score, most of it written by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. `` Godspell'' remains the composer's most beguiling work. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> later went on to write such musicals as `` Pippin,'' `` The Magic Show'' and `` The Baker's Wife,'' but it is in his first show that he found the best inspiration. From an anthem like `` Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord'' to an obvious uptempo show stopper like `` We Beseech Thee,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> tailored his music to a young, enthusiastic cast and still managed to produce one song, `` Day by Day,'' which found a life outside the musical. It's been fashionable to dismiss `` Godspell'' for its naivete and simple-mindedness, but this revival contains some surprising moments of power, particularly at the end of the evening when <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is betrayed by <PERSON> Judas </PERSON>. The scene is memorable for a fine bit of acting by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Steefel </PERSON> as the street version of the messiah and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON> as his betrayer. But then the entire cast exudes a precision and passion uncommon in most revivals. They are among some of the best young musical comedy talent around. The others include <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a bewitching seductress; <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>, a sweet-faced singer; <PERSON> Trini </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, a striking woman with a low, sexy voice; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Damaschke </PERSON>, a goofy, likable performer; <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jemmott </PERSON>, a fine comedian and a belter as well; <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Korbich </PERSON>, a real song-and-dance hoofer; <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Korf </PERSON>, who manages to make `` Day by Day'' sound fresh, and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrineau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a sturdy soul singer. The scenery by <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> is a generic street scene, while the costumes by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolard </PERSON> are thrift-shop eccentric, making up in color what they lack in high fashion. But this resurrection of `` Godspell'' has plenty of style, high spirits and sense of fun, which make it impossible to resist. It should win plenty of new converts.

<HEAD>Canadians Stage Nationwide Protests Over U.S.-Canada Trade Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of Canadians nationwide protested the U.S.-Canada trade bill on Sunday by lighting candles, parading in cars and stuffing phony ballot boxes with mock votes against the agreement. Several groups of demonstrators in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> also rallied near bridges and other border crossings at <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sault </LOCATION> Ste. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. Opponents of the Free Trade Agreement, which is to begin relaxing trade barriers between the nations on Jan. 1, demanded that Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> call new elections for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> before the bill goes into effect. `` We want a vote _ now,'' demonstrators chanted on Parliament Hill in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. Trade bill opponents also shouted `` Lyin' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>,'' a reference to <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s 1983 statements opposing free trade between the nations. Protesters stuffed carboard boxes with mock ballots rejecting what they called `` the sell-out of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' Elswhere, demonstrators sang protest songs, paraded in cars and lit candles. Protests were reported in <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>; St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>; and numerous cities in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. The protests Sunday were orchestrated by a coalition called the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of labor, social, women's, farm and other groups. They say the bill will sell out <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s economy, culture and social programs. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the agreement Jan. 2. It would eliminate tariffs and reduce other barriers in nearly every facet of the $ 150 billion annual trading partnership. The changes would begin next year and be phased in during a 10-year period. The agreement, however, must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and it faces staunch opposition from lawmakers in both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls 208 seats in the 282-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, but public opinion polls show Canadians are sharply split on the agreement. Opposition stems from a variety of areas. <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> grape growers, for example, are upset because the agreement would eliminate an automatic 65 percent markup on U.S.-made wine. <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, the industrial and financial giant of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 10 provinces, has also seen strong opposition to the agreement. Liberal <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Axworthy </PERSON> and New Democrat <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Langdon </PERSON> both told the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> crowd Sunday they will continue attempts to block the government's legislation in the Commons, where the bill is up for second reading. `` We will make sure that Canadians get a full opportunity be heard,'' said <PERSON> Axworthy </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, about 100 protestors gathered at city hall and others picketed the homes of conservative ministers of Parliament.

 Democrats agreed Sunday that their platform must brand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, but bickered over whether to call for a freeze in Pentagon spending. Winding up a long weekend at this quaint resort, the Democrats' platform drafting committee sidestepped the question of the federal budget deficit and whether to call for higher taxes on the rich as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants The 16-member drafting committee left that and other issues that separate the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps for another day. It took no votes, but will meet again sometime before the full 186-member <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> convenes in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> June 25-26. Before adjourning, the Democrats released working papers on 10 issues hashed out behind the scenes by the committee staff and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign officials. These briefs call for appointment of a federal drug czar, adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, ending homelessness, expanding AIDS research, and providing advance notice of plant closings. `` I found more areas of agreement that disagreement,'' Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the drafting panels' chairman, said after wrapping up the three-day meeting. Those who hoped for blood `` will find the floor is clean,'' said <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s platform chief. But significant gaps remained between the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stances on taxes, defense and foreign policy that could be fought out in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> or on the convention floor next month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. There was no argument, though, over the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign's insistence that the platform denounce <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a terrorist state Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said, `` We have no problem calling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, but let's go beyond that. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s foreign policy adviser, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor favors passage of the tougher sanctions in the Dellums-Wolpe bill that would give the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> 60 days to decide whether to put <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on a list of terrorist nations with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Divisions among the platform drafters quickly resurfaced when the discussion turned to freezing the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget and whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should renounce any first use of nuclear weapons. Two <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> leaders on the panel counseled against too dovish a stance. <PERSON> Rachelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said the Democrats must root out waste in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, but also `` honor our treaty obligations and defend democratic institutions and our freedoms. I hope this platform will call for a stable defense budget and not for any specific freezes or cuts.'' <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> McLemore </PERSON>, a political science professor and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stalwart from <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, replied, `` The defense budget is not a sacred cow. I wish to see <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> persons and commissioners and judges and everybody run on this platform and feel comfortable with it, but we can not dupe the American people.'' `` As Democrats, we owe the country a serious look at freezing and cutting that defense budget and shifting those funds'' to social programs, <PERSON> McLemore </PERSON> said. `` I really do n't think we can get out of the maze by saying to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that we'll deal with it in the sweet by and by.'' <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> defended the notion of a stable defense budget, saying, `` You just ca n't say we're going to pull out of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or pull out of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the next 12 or 24 months.'' And when <PERSON> McLemore </PERSON> urged the party to join the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops in renouncing any intention of using nuclear weapons, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Booe </PERSON>, the secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, rose to the defense of deterrence. `` Over 40 years of negotiating with a lot of people ..., I'll tell you I do n't tell any adversary for sure I'm not going to do anything From a bargaining standpoint, from a diplomatic standpoint, I want to keep them off balance,'' <PERSON> Booe </PERSON> said. Another <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, lawyer, urged that the platform embrace <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> views on self-determination for the Palestinians, but there was no reply by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces. But <PERSON> Albright </PERSON> told reporters flatly that the platform will not contain language that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants endorsing self-determination for the Palestinian people. The working paper on defense and foreign policy, as well as one on government and voting reforms, will be written later and distributed to the drafting committee before its second meeting, which <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said may be held June 24 in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> on the eve of the full panel's session. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chief platform representative, said, `` There are differences and the differences are important.'' But he predicted, `` We are going to leave -LRB- <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> -RRB- united and determined to win that election in November.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> told reporters, `` We are not seeking floor fights.'' He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has enough delegates to force a floor fight on any issue he chooses, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will have a large enough majority to prevail.

 An AIDS drug can dramatically boost the intelligence of youngsters whose brains are damaged by the AIDS virus and even restores their ability to walk and talk, researchers said Sunday. Damage to the brain is one of the earliest and most devastating of the effects of the lethal virus in children. The research suggests that the drug AZT can reverse these symptoms and apparently bring virus-damaged brain cells back to health. AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is the only medicine routinely used to suppress the AIDS virus, called HIV. In adults, it can slow the progression of AIDS but does not cure it.

 Southern Baptists squared off Sunday for another battle over control of the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination, now firmly in the hands of the fundamentalist wing. As thousands of `` messengers'' gathered here for their annual convention, some observers said the moderate camp might make a comeback after nine years of defeat. `` It looks as if moderates could win in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>,'' wrote <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, editor of the `` <ORGANIZATION> SBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>,'' urging the other side to bring in voters to avert such an outcome. Convention business begins Tuesday after a day of preliminary meetings and preaching. Up to 40,000 people are expected to attend as representatives of the church's 14.7 million members.

 On a small dairy farm tucked under the Canadian border, the `` For Sale'' sign has come down. Vermonters, worried that the small farmer might become an endangered species, hope it is the beginning of a trend. What prompted <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> to change his mind and stay on his 100-cow farm was the promise of $ 5,000 cash this year from the state. Most of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s 2,700 farmers are eligible for the subsidy under the first such program ever enacted by a state. Farmers have until Wednesday to apply; a maximum of $ 5,000 will be paid each farmer. The subsidy was born out of fear that the farms that play such a large role in the heritage of one of the nation's most rural states would soon vanish from the landscape.

 It may look more like a coffee klatch than researchers hard at work on a new product, but that's the whole idea. The concept of group decision-making triggered by spontaneous encounters is shaping the design of a $ 75 million research and development center being built at <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's leading designer and manufacturer of office furniture Not only does the new seven-story, pyramid-shaped building represent a shift in <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION>'s own corporate culture; the company also hopes to market the concept of group creativeness to its customers. `` Buying new furniture and computers wo n't get people to be more productive,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> said. `` Customers are coming to us with a larger agenda. They want to understand how they can work better and how their people can work better. `` But before we can be the office environment company for anyone else, we have to be it for ourselves.'' Though teamwork and spontaneous meetings are nothing new, it's unusual for a company of <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION>'s size to tinker with success The 76-year-old company had about $ 1.5 billion in sales last year. It controls about a quarter of the office furniture market, according to <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallucchi </PERSON>, editor and co-publisher of Facilities Design and Management, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> City-based trade magazine. The new <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is architecturally designed to foster communication among all levels of the organization, putting in practice the theory that spontaneous interaction is the best catalyst for creativeness. About 400 of the 8,000 workers the company employs in Grand Rapids will be moved into the building, just south of its headquarters early next year. `` We're trying to provide as many opportunities as we can in this building for people to run into one another,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Veneklasen </PERSON>, organizational environmental psychologist for <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION>. `` Research shows that 80 percent of professionals' ideas come from face-to-face communication.'' To encourage that kind of spontaneity, there are few barriers in the building; escalators are used instead of elevators -LRB- `` People never talk on elevators,'' <PERSON> Veneklasen </PERSON> said -RRB-; and four entrances to the building feed into a central meeting place, or `` town square'' in the atrium. Using what designers have dubbed the `` cave and commons'' approach, each employee will have his or her own private space, or `` cave.'' But in the middle of a circle of caves will be the group's commons area, also dubbed `` interaction nodes,'' for group meetings. Each of these areas will be equipped with a coffee and soft drink bar _ and a marker board for when the conversation turns to product ideas. `` We know that people are going to talk about the stupid neighbor's dog that kept them up all night long and they're going to diagram football plays ... But they're also going to talk about product ideas,'' <PERSON> Veneklasen </PERSON> said. `` If one product idea comes out of only one of those coffee areas, they've paid for themselves for the life of the building, given our manufacturing abilities,'' <PERSON> Veneklasen </PERSON> said. Executives will be in the directors' cluster, a ring of private offices in the middle of the building. For the `` lone rangers,'' there will be small offices without telephones or other potential distractions, <PERSON> Veneklasen </PERSON> said. There will be terraces with outdoor work areas and a fitness trail. Prairie grass will replace the traditional grass and shrubs. The company will be structured not by departments, as it is now, but by projects. All the people involved in a project, whether they be in the engineering, marketing or design departments, will be grouped together. `` At most companies, the process of developing a product is usually linear, like a relay race where the person does his part and passes it on to the next person,'' <PERSON> Veneklasen </PERSON> said. `` We're taking the rugby team approach. The designers, the engineers, the manufacturing people, the marketing people and the corporate communications people will ... pass the ball back and forth, but all going in the same direction at the same time.'' The 573,000-foot building will feature state-of-the-art laboratories for perfecting the office environment, including research on office acoustics, lighting and temperature control. <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> has said the center will serve as a springboard for its future plans: to add 8,000 employees to its worldwide work force of 17,500 by the turn of the century. It sees the consulting service as a natural extension of its existing business, where single chairs carry price tags of up to $ 900 and big orders for major companies can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> says <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION> plans no extra charge to customers for its logistical advice. Indeed, such consulting is fast becoming a popular addition to the industry's sales pitch. `` It's not just a question of putting in a desk and a couple of file cabinets anymore,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Groot </PERSON>, communications director for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` The aim now is to create an environment that allows office workers to take full advantage of new technology and be as productive as possible.'' But when it comes to advising clients, is <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION>'s open style for everyone? Some researchers say the concept of group creativeness, at the heart of Japanese industry, may not work in a society where individualism is king. `` It's like changing somebody's religion,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmon </PERSON>, an assistant professor at <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> who has been studying how well <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are adjusting to Japanese work practices. Even for <ORGANIZATION> Steelcase </ORGANIZATION>, the team approach may make some managers uncomfortable. `` It's going to take time for everybody to get used to it,'' admitted <PERSON> Veneklasen </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Study Urges Mexico to Encourage Ties with U.S. Auto Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study commissioned by the Mexican government says <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> should strengthen its ties to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automobile industry by making it easier to export cars assembled in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and by upgrading its auto parts industry, according to a report published Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which obtained the study, said it notes that a closer alliance between the two nations' auto industries might develop only if <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> distinguished itself from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and other nations competing in the market. The study, conducted by the consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Booz-Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was commissioned last year by the Mexican government and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> as part of efforts to obtain <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans for industrial restructuring. `` The Mexican government must differentiate <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from other countries -LRB- <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -RRB- in the eyes of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public stressing proximity, cultural ties, common problems and the long period of constructive relationships,'' the study said. `` If <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protectionism grows and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is lumped together with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in retaliatory <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade legislation, all of the recommendations in this report are moot,'' it said. The study estimated that salaried auto workers in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are paid 20 percent to 25 percent of what their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts receive. The study argued that the lower costs were part of `` Mexican economic advantages within a North American auto production system -LRB- that -RRB- saves jobs for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. workers.'' `` Without access to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, to selectively provide low-cost labor as part of the overall process, more vehicles ... and parts would be obtained from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and various <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> countries with the consequent loss of both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican jobs,'' the study said. <PERSON> Booz-Allen </PERSON> recommended that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> immediately upgrade its auto parts-making industy, which accounted for more than half of that nation's $ 900 million auto exports trade surplus in 1986. The study also called for easing regulations on companies already assembling cars in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to encourage more exports to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. It also recommended that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> establish a technical center in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to keep pace with technological developments. The Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers each have assembly, engine and parts plants in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said they were unaware of plans to increase investments there. A <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said company does n't discuss possible investments. <PERSON> Booz-Allen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> would have to convince the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union that an automotive alliance would benefit both countries. But <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON> said the union remained opposed to Mexican auto investments that he said exploited workers there and caused the loss of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs. `` If the Mexicans develop a more competitive industry, it will mean the loss of more jobs,'' he told the News.

<HEAD>New Breed of Farmers Dealing Directly with Commodities Exchanges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMPSHIRE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The successful farmer of the future may be the one who pays the closest attention to the futures, say a new breed of computerized farmers who deal directly with the nation's commodities exchanges <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagemann </PERSON>, 44, who grows soybeans and corn and fattens feeder cattle on his family's 1,800-acre farm near this <LOCATION> Kane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community, is typical of the new breed. Although <PERSON> Hagemann </PERSON> wears a soiled cap from a fertilizer company, he does n't resort to the marketing strategies many other farmers in his area still use. Instead of delivering his corn and beans to the local elevator every year and selling them through a forward contract, <PERSON> Hagemann </PERSON> sells his crops and cattle months in advance in complex contracts directly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hagemann </PERSON>'s computer and his constant electronic display of commodity price quotes are as important to his farming as his combine and his corn dryer. Experts say that by using the futures exchanges to market their products, farmers can obtain price stability _ particularly in volatile markets like the one being driven by the current drought _ along with marketing versatility, and they can maximize profits. <PERSON> Hagemann </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> recently that he has been dealing directly with the exchanges for 20 years, which makes him something of a pioneer in the process, used by only 10 to 15 percent of the nation's farmers. Farm experts, commodities brokers and farm economy consultants say farmers who learn the new marketing techniques have a definite advantage over their more tradition-bound neighbors. `` The family farm is romantic history,'' says consultant <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, who conducts marketing seminars for farmers throughout the nation. `` Farmers must use modern business tools if they are to survive, and that specifically includes the use of futures and options.'' Another farmer who hedges by selling and buying futures and options contracts is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 44, who operates a 3,000-acre corn, soybean and hog farm east of <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who studied the marketing techniques at a local junior college, says he does n't understand the attitude of other farmers who staged demonstrations outside the Board of Trade some years back to protest what they believed was price manipulation. `` The speculator does not set the price of the commodity; rather the market sets the price,'' says <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and others advise them to make a serious study of marketing techniques before attempting to use them. `` You can not get too close to the market; particularly during these times of extreme price volatility,'' warns computerized Shabbona farmer <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, 23. `` A lot of farmers come in here and just watch the quotes as they come across the screen, when they should be out watching their crops.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its biggest shareholder, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, may be headed for a showdown this week that could determine the course of their acrimonious takeover dispute. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is waging a proxy fight for five seats on the 14-member <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> board in an effort to pressure the oil giant to let shareholders vote on his $ 60-a-share offer for the 85.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock that he does not already own. The bid values the entire company at $ 14.6 billion. The deadline for the proxy votes on the board seats is Friday when <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> plans to hold its annual shareholders meeting in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has rejected <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s buyout proposal, and has questioned his ability to finance it Wall Street has also been skeptical about the offer. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> finished last week at $ 51.87 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has said he is so certain he could arrange the financing that he says he would put $ 300 million in escrow for payment to shareholders if he failed to arrange it by the date of the shareholder vote on the offer. Meanwhile, a published report over the weekend said court documents show an investment firm that has a large stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> considered selling its stake and <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> once tried to bring in Canadian investor <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> to buy it. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that the court papers indicate the deal never took place, however, because the parties could not agree on a price. The Times said its report on Saturday was based on documents unsealed at the newspaper's request by Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, who had earlier denied access to depositions taken in suits between <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> related to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s takeover effort. The Times story said that <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, the chairman of Bears, <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage house that bought stock for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a deposition that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> once considered selling his shares to the buyout firm. The newspaper said <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> was acting as a go-between, and in several proposed transactions, the buyer and seller were unaware of each other's identities. It said <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> did not identify <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> in his deposition, but that a Bears <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> lawyer did later. It said the deposition makes clear that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and not <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> recruited <PERSON> Belzberg </PERSON> as a potential buyer. The newspaper said <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>'s deposition indicates the transaction never took place because the parties could not agree on a price. On Friday, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said he was forming a new holding company to act as his sole vehicle for acquisitions, including a possible hostile takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. He said the holding company intended to raise up to $ 3.25 billion through an offering of stock and debt securities. The <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> group of companies also will contribute equity to the holding company, including its 36.1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> and its interests in <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ACF </ORGANIZATION>, a leasing company. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> board refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer, he would consider making a hostile bid for it through the new holding company at yet to be determined terms.
