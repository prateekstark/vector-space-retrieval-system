 TV evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who has threatened a libel suit for a stripper's story of an alleged sexual liaison with him, said Wednesday that he knows of another effort being planned to discredit him. Speaking to about 600 people at his Family Worship Center, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> again accused Penthouse magazine of scheming to destroy his ministry with a story in which <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> said she performed sex acts for him while he watched. Without revealing any details, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said his ministry had uncovered another move against him. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said the plan involved different people. `` There's another effort afoot, as preposterous as this one ... If you have enough money you can get anyone to say anything,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s allegations are similar to those raised last year by a prostitute, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>, which led to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ouster from the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination, and reversed the fortunes of <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swaggart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s employer labeled the stripper's allegations, detailed in Penthouse's current issue, `` a pornographic fairy tale.'' The magazine said Monday that it was standing by its article. On Monday, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said there was `` not one shred of truth to these allegations. I have never met or seen the woman.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s attorneys said they had evidence the story was a hoax, but refused to discuss specifics Wednesday night, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said the ministry was approached by a man in December who knew of <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s allegations `` and spilled his insides ... he said he believed it was a hoax.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> also said a woman he identified as <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s employer also called the ministry and said she knew the story was false. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not reveal the caller's name. <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Shear </PERSON>, co-owner of a `` strip-o-gram'' service that employs <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said Monday that her sister, <PERSON> Nona </PERSON>, told her <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> made up the story after seeing the Penthouse story on <PERSON> Murphree </PERSON>'s relations with <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. Shear's sister, contacted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said a lawyer had advised her not to comment. Efforts to reach <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON> for comment have been unsuccessful. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said the man who revealed <PERSON> Kampen </PERSON>'s story to the ministry had told him Penthouse publisher <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Guccione </PERSON> was angry because of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s work in pressuring convenience stores to discontinue carrying the men's magazine. A telephone call after business hours Wednesday, seeking comment from Penthouse's spokesmen at their <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> offices was not answered. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said that during the past year, he had `` learned not to judge people. I've learned that I'm not God.'' He also advised his congregation not to `` get to the point where it's ` us' and ` them.''' His ministry would continue with expanded television programming to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. `` We are going to go forward to tell the story of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as we have never gone forth before,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a telegram to Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> that he was `` willing to work for peace,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also met on Wednesday with former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> both are in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' inauguration ceremonies this week. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> brought with him a new peace proposal which he showed to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> declined to discuss specifics, but told reporters it dealt with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and its neighbor, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, which the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels have used as a base for some operations. A source close to Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' inauguration, said the plan had to do with resettlement of rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> once peace is achieved. Contra leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said that Socialist international leaders familiar with the plan told him it also contained provisions for political prisoners in <LOCATION> Nicaraqua </LOCATION> and for granting civil liberties in the country. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a live interview on <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> television that he sent a letter of congratulations to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president's inauguration, and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent him a telegram in response `` in which he said he was willing to work for peace.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he reminded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of the time they shook hands at the inauguration of Brazilian President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> in 1985, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vice president, and how `` all the leaders of the world applauded this unanimously.'' In a press conference after the interview, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said that `` the conditions are not yet ripe for a direct dialogue'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he would be meeting with Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON> and other Central American presidents this week in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> to discuss regional problems. `` This will give us an opportunity to talk about common problems -LRB- including -RRB- the -LRB- peace -RRB- plan, its advances, and a meeting of Central American presidents,'' he said. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> on Wednesday would be before a meeting <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> plans to hold with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Friday. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said this week that the five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents have agreed to a summit on Feb. 14-15 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to discuss the peace plan, adopted in August 1987. The presidents are expected to be in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> for the Perez inauguration. After meeting with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said in a communique that the meeting was `` a great step towards the solution to the problem of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' although it did not elaborate. It emphasized that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was not acting as a representative of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government during his stay here. The former president moderated a forum on the Latin American foreign debt and noted in his brief comments that last year alone poor nations transferred $ 35 billion to rich countries in debt payments. `` We must seek solutions to the crises of nations, desperately poor and suffering, who spend sometimes half their export earnings just to pay interest on their debt and in the process the debt continues to increase,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` This reunion of world leaders is a wonderful opportunity to assess this crucial problem,'' he said.

 Schools were ordered closed for the rest of the week in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> amid warnings that temperatures would go to 40 below, as the Alaska-born cold blast pushed south and east, stretching the big chill from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Closed roads and icy highways took their toll as at least one motorist was killed in a 17-vehicle pileup in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, a tour bus crashed on an icy stretch of <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> interstate and 100-car string of accidents occurred near <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` February is going to be quite different from January,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Snider </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Midwesterners who chuckled at the weather in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> over the weekend while polishing their golf clubs got their comeuppance as winter set in with a vengeance The normally rainy Pacific Northwest got a rare snowfall, and Easterners counted the waning hours of springlike weather as the cold front moved their way. <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, reported gusts over 100 mph early Wednesday and 60 mph by midday, knocking out power to as many as 15,000 customers. Snow caved in the roof of <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>'s soccer center, causing $ 250,000 damage, officials said. At least 20 people were injured when a tour bus carrying about two dozen passengers overturned on icy, wind-swept Interstate 80 in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, and six people were hospitalized, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol reported. The big winter storm, with 60 mph gusts, knocked out electrical power to a `` big chunk'' of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday night, with blackouts extending 40 miles to <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskelsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Eskelsen </PERSON> said engineers believed the outage was the result of `` dirty rain'' coating insulators on power poles and blowing fuses, and some crews had reports of burning power poles. In northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, authorities blamed a night of minus 20-degree temperatures for the hypothermia death of a 31-year-old woman whose frozen body was found on a sidewalk in Coleraine. As the cold pushed into the country Wednesday, temperatures fell 18 degrees in one hour at <LOCATION> Ardmore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, which shared the nation's high of 84 degrees Tuesday afternoon, had readings in the lower teens a day later and wind chills in the 30-below-zero range. With <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s wind chills expected to dip as low as 80 degrees below over the next several days, Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> ordered all schools to close until Monday. `` The weather forecast for the next two days calls for bitter cold to the extent that our young people are at risk, particularly those being transported to school,'' Sinner said. A wind-chill reading of 90 below was recorded Wednesday morning at <LOCATION> Tioga </LOCATION>, in northwestern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The wind chill reading at mid-afternoon was 67 below at <LOCATION> Williston </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where high winds and chill temperatures forced the closing of many roads, crews worked to clear wreckage from a pileup on Interstate 84. Eight semi trucks and nine other vehicles were involved, and at least one person was killed, said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Twin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. Not counting <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, was the nation's icebox at midday Wednesday, with a reading of 31 below zero, and temperatures in the state were forecast to dip below 40 below by Thursday morning. Electric power in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, a city of 57,000, and several smaller towns in north-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> was knocked out for nearly an hour Wednesday morning when the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> hydroelectric dam broke down. `` We do n't know what caused it,'' said <PERSON> Cort </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` There's a lot of things that can happen in weather like this.'' In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, where it all began as the thermometer went as low as 60 below over the weekend, temperatures moderated Wednesday over much of the state except for the area near the Canadian border. While <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> was reporting just 11 degrees below zero and no wind, <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Highway near the Yukon had a 7 a.m. reading of 59 below. <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION> posted an extreme of another sort when the barometric pressure reached 31.85 inches late Tuesday, a record high-pressure reading for the North American continent. The reading there eased off Wednesday morning but was still a high 31.31 inches. It was the effects of the high pressure system on the jet stream that created the unusual weather pattern. The barometric pressure was so high that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminitration </ORGANIZATION> early Wednesday issued an order restricting instrument and night flights over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, saying that altimeters that use barometric pressure might not calculate a plane's altitude accurately at that high pressure. The snowfall at <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was enough to shut all runways at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for nearly an hour Wednesday morning. The snowfall at the airport, 2 inches and counting at midmorning, plus temperatures in the teens made it the worst wintry weather in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in more than three years. In the Plains, agriculture experts said the cold snap could reduce the evaporation from farm fields, already dry from last summer's drought and the dry winter. But that was the only good news for farmers in the forecast. Fruit growers worried that trees had begun to bud in the warmth and would now be in danger; the thirsty winter wheat crop in the southern Plains faced new stresses without the blanket of snow that usually keeps it safe during the winter; and ranchers across the Plains worked Wednesday to shelter cattle from the sudden cold. `` Now we've got something that's unbelieveable _ record highs, and suddenly within one day we go to cold temperatures,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Baenziger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska-Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>. But in the East, record highs continued to topple Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, normally known for its wintry weather, the record high for the date of 53, set just last year, was broken at 3 a.m. with a reading of 56 degrees. There was no snow on the ground, and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> was not frozen. It was 66 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; 67 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; 67 in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>; 59 in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and 70 in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, all records for the date. As winter swept toward the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region, ski operators said it could n't come soon enough. `` The crowds just do n't see snow, and it stops them from coming out,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerych </PERSON>, ticket office manager at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. `` As soon as it hits, we'll get ourselves fixed up again.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Guerrillas Reject Lawyers For Treason Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have refused legal representation for their treason trial. They said they did not recognize the court's authority and would not enter a plea. The four black men, in a statement read by one to the <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delmas </LOCATION> on Wednesday, said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s judicial system `` is founded on injustice and oppression.'' The defendants, who could face the death penalty if convicted, are charged with treason, terrorism, murder, attempted murder and other offenses in connection with a mine blast that wounded 17 people in 1986 and the killings of two policemen, a black politician and a black woman. The four, who said they have been tortured during eight months in solitary confinement, are <PERSON> Obed </PERSON> <PERSON> Masina </PERSON>, 56; Ting-ting <PERSON> Masango </PERSON>, 28; <LOCATION> Neo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Potsane </LOCATION>, 26, and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhura </PERSON>, 26. In their statement, read by <PERSON> Masina </PERSON>, they acknowledged their membership in the military wing of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and described themselves as soldiers who should not be tried in a civilian court. Dozens of supporters in the courtroom raised clenched fists and cheered when <PERSON> Masina </PERSON> said the four would not enter a plea. The guerrilla group was outlawed in 1960 after decades of non-violent political activity and has been waging a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending white minority rule. <PERSON> Delmas </PERSON> is a farming town about 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The country's longest treason trial, involving senior anti-apartheid leaders who last year received long prison terms, began there in 1985 before shifting to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Under the country's apartheid system, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Taiwan Officials Concerned Gambling Will Disrupt Booming Economy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With money pouring from a booming export business, a lust for gambling has taken hold and turned this Nationalist Chinese island into a massive underground casino. Officials say it threatens to disrupt the economy. The gambling craze is attributed to the flood of idle cash created by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s economic success and of limited investment opportunities. `` It's worse than a huge casino,'' said a dismayed <PERSON> Jaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Shao-kang </PERSON>, a legislator of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't even have fair gambling rules and decent bookies.'' Gambling is illegal in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, but an estimated 2 million people, or roughly one-tenth the population, play an underground game based on results of a twice-weekly lottery in nearby <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. They are lured by the chance to win 10 to 500 times their bets, which typically are 500 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 18 -RRB- or more. Only a tiny fraction of players, about 6,000 people, were arrested or fined last year. The game became a favorite with farmers, factory workers and market vendors after the government suspended its own lottery in 1987 to break up underground gambling based on the drawing. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, when the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> lottery is held, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s telephone lines are jammed by people calling bookies for results. Gamblers pray to folk gods for winning numbers and often celebrate at <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples when they win. `` The lottery gamblers have gone too far,'' fumed <PERSON> Ching </PERSON> <PERSON> Mei-hsien </PERSON>, principal of <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which is near such a temple. `` Their noisy celebrations often disrupt our students in class.'' <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s two largest cities, <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION>, recently proposed running their own lotteries to raise funds for social welfare programs. Cabinet approval is needed for the drawings to begin later this year. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Taiwanese have turned to gambling on futures prices on commodity markets in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. An estimated 500 local companies, including jewelry shops and investment firms, accept daily bets totaling about 5 billion <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 179 million -RRB- based on the movement of futures prices on the overseas markets, according to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON>, a financial consultant with the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which advises businesses and government agencies. Newspapers estimate each company has about 160 clients, meaning about 80,000 people gamble on commodity prices. Even the local stock exchange is widely viewed as little more than a legal form of gambling. Many inexperienced players such as housewives, office clerks, retired servicemen and college students view the market solely as a way to make quick money through speculation. The exchange reported in January that about 1.66 million people have opened accounts with stock brokers. Trading volume totaled the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollar equivalent of about $ 280 billion last year, the third largest in the world after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. On average, each of the total 34 billion shares changed hands nearly three times last year, even though roughly two-thirds of the shares were closely held and not for sale. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien </PERSON>, chairman of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, believes the gambling craze has changed traditional values that helped <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> improve its economy dramatically, with per capita annual income in 1988 of 157,400 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 5,512 -RRB-, a 56 percent increase from 1983. `` So many people are obsessed with speculation,'' <PERSON> Chien </PERSON> said. `` They want to become rich overnight, and they no longer work so hard for the money.'' In a recent speech, Economics Minister <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Li-an </PERSON> said the trend could eventually erode <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s economic achievement. He complained that businesmen increasingly prefer the pursuit of quick profit through gambling and speculation over productive investment. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shou-hsiang </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, said the lack of channels for investment is a major reason behind the upswing in gambling. Most bonds are purchased by banks, real estate is too expensive and only a few mutual funds are allowed. The government has taken some steps to help open up new investment opportunities in recent years, easing foreign exchange controls to stimulate overseas investment. Some Taiwanese still fear overseas investments as an unknown risk, however, and have been reluctant to diversify.

 A man whose pregnant wife has been in a coma for seven weeks urged asked a judge Wednesday to appoint him her legal guardian so he can authorize an abortion that he says will save her life. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s 32-year-old wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, was critically injured in a car collision on Dec. 13 and is in a coma at north <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhasset </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 34, a self-employed accountant who lives in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brookville </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, told the court that physicians have advised him that an abortion is necessary to save his wife's life and assist in her recovery. His petition is opposed by anti-abortion activists <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, who have asked the court to be appointed legal guardians of the fetus, which is about 16 to 18 weeks old. The case, considered unprecedented by legal and medical experts, is being heard by Justice <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> of the trial-level state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, attended Wednesday's hearing and said they too were in favor of ending their daughter's pregnancy. Mrs. <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON> told the court that her daughter and son-in-law, who have a 3-year-old daughter, had been looking forward to having a second child. Asked if she agreed that ending the pregnancy was in her daughter's best interest, Mrs. <PERSON> Zusselman </PERSON> replied: `` Absolutely.'' Three physicians, called to testified by <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Schutz </PERSON>, said that a continued pregnancy could endanger Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>'s well-being Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Einstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said he felt strongly that ending the pregnancy was necessary to save her life and should be done immediately, he said. `` A continuation of this pregnancy would push her over the cliff,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carras </PERSON>, chief of neurosurgery at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shore </LOCATION>, said that the prognosis for Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was guarded because of the pregnancy and other conditions. The <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office was allowed to monitor the proceedings to `` ensure that there is no criminal violation of law,'' according to Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schutz </PERSON> objected to the prosecutor's involvement. `` What is this nonsense of a criminal statute?'' he said. `` We are doing nothing criminal here. We are only asking the court to appoint an guardian for the welfare of a woman in a coma.'' The case was continued to Thursday, at which time the judge was expected to consider the petitions of the two Right-To-Life advocates.

 Police arrested about 20 people during a protest against <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s alleged repression of ethnic Hungarians and its campaign of demolishing villages, a spokeswoman for the activists said. The demonstration outside the Romanian Embassy was organized by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and Solidarity trade union movement, said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Zuzanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabrowska </PERSON>. Both organizations are banned. Ms. <PERSON> Dabrowska </PERSON> said a small group of protesters on Tuesday gathered in front of the embassy and shouted `` We are in solidarity with the Romanians.'' The group distributed leaflets to about 100 people across the street from the embassy before police began making arrests. `` We would like Feb. 1 to become the day of solidarity with the Romanian nation. The situation there has not changed and it's important we establish such a tradition,'' <PERSON> Dabrowska </PERSON> said Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s plan to demolish up to 7,000 villages in his Soviet bloc country and replace them with huge agro-industrial complexes has been widely criticized as a flagrant violation of human rights. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is particularly concerned that many of the villages to be razed are inhabited by ethnic Hungarians, and last year the official Polish press pointed out that a few of the villages are populated by ethnic Poles.

<TEXT>
 Spurred by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to open talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, Israelis have embarked on a serious debate about a subject once virtually taboo here: talking peace with the Palestinian organization. The subject is debated almost daily on radio shows and in newspaper columns. At least two members of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> and ex-Minister <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, have called for talking to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s representatives. The broad-based Peace Now movement recently changed its position to support talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must speak with them, we must listen, we must exchange words ... We have to talk to those we want to make peace with,'' said <PERSON> Galia </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON>, a leading Peace Now figure. She and <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> are attending a conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> along with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, despite an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law against meetings with members of `` terrorist'' organizations. For many Israelis, accepting the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is not just a political but a psychological hurdle. For years, they have associated it with atrocities, such as the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. But a public opinion poll late last year indicated 54 percent of Israelis support talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, provided the organization renounces terrorism and accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The change in opinion is due in part to the Palestinian uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and in part to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements in December renouncing terrorism and accepting <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence. Strong tactics aimed at quelling the 13-month uprising, or intefadeh, have brought international criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. At least 370 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the rebellion. `` Before the intefadeh, we saw the Palestinians in the occupied territories as construction workers, and Palestinians outside were terrorists,'' said <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirov </PERSON>, who was kicked out of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc for holding talks with pro-PLO figures two years ago. `` Now there is a whole new image: the image of a 14-year-old boy who throws stones, and who can not be beaten by our army.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief's new moderate stance has isolated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to open a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December, and several European nations are urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to do the same. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, repeated Tuesday he would never speak to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. His party's coalition agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> takes that stand, but dovish members of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> are starting to call for changes At least two Labor members are among the four Israeli legislators who have attended meetings along with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in the past month. <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a former air force officer and defense minister, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> last week <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> should drop the ban on talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today the only party able to deliver what it promises in the territories _ able to bring about an end to the rioting _ is the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said But opponents _ including <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, which won the most votes in November elections _ say the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has not changed, despite <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statements `` The bottom line is they want a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samarea </LOCATION> just as a down payment to throw us out of here,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Tzahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanegbi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Samarea </PERSON> are the biblical names of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Security risks are a persuasive argument. Even Israelis who support talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> are aware of the risk a Palestinian state might pose to the Jewish state. Israelis have fought five wars with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states in 40 years and still remember the vulnerable narrow borders before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 It takes a special tusker to carry <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>'s tooth. That task will fall to <LOCATION> Indiraja </LOCATION>, a 4,884-pound elephant from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> named in honor of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Indiraja </PERSON>, who will be shipped to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> next week to begin years of training in the sacred service of <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>, has a tough act to follow. The new elephant will replace <PERSON> Raja </PERSON>, a popular pachyderm who served for half a century at the Temple of the Tooth in <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Neranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, the temple's chief custodian. <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> was long in the tooth himself, reaching the age of 82 before dying in July. The 13-year-old Indiraja, also a male, was selected for his proper posture so that he may carry the sacred tooth of <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> in one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s most colorful pageants. `` It will take couple of years to train the elephant,'' <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said Wednesday. He picked out <LOCATION> Indiraja </LOCATION> during a visit to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> after Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> announced plans to donate an elephant to the temple in <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>, 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The death of the beloved Raja, whose name means `` King'' in the Sinhalese language, plunged Sinhalese Buddhists into grief. <PERSON> Raja </PERSON> was so popular that former President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> declared him a national treasure. <PERSON> Indiraja </PERSON>, who will arrive in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on Feb. 8, measures 7 -LCB- feet from head to toe and has a flat back. Both his tail and trunk touch the ground in the arc deemed proper for elephants. The main task for Indiraja will be carrying the sacred tooth, revered as coming from <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>'s own mouth, at the annual <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION> pageant, which is held for two weeks in July and August. Because Indiraja still will be in training at the time of this year's festivities, the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION> is trying to find a local male elephant _ only males can carry the tooth _ for the task. Efforts are on either to reduce the amount of fireworks and noise so that the untrained elephant wo n't panic, or have an elephant who is unaffected by noise and fireworks in the tooth-carrying ceremony. According to historians, the tooth was smuggled into <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in the 4th century for safekeeping during a war. The tooth is kept in a golden casket at the temple at <LOCATION> Kandy </LOCATION>. During the festival, it is paraded around the town on an elephant's back Buddhism was founded in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> about 500 B.C. when <PERSON> Siddhartha </PERSON> <PERSON> Gautama </PERSON>, born a prince, achieved enlightenment. He later came to be known as Lord <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>. Sinhalese Buddhists make up about 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. There are about 5 million Buddhists in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.

 Teacher <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> has received honors from law officers for trying to fight off a gunman who invaded her school a year ago. But she is proudest that no children were harmed in the 12-hour ordeal. `` I thought about that when I heard of children getting killed and wounded at other schools in the country recently,'' she said. `` I was glad our children did n't have to see any blood. Blood is life.'' Recent shootings at schools in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, `` made me realize how thankful I am that it was n't our school,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carden </PERSON>, headmaster of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't want to turn our schools into prisons, but we've got to do something to protect our children.'' West End <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is planning to build another campus, he said, `` and the first thing we thought about is security.'' Last Feb. 2, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, wearing denim clothes, a baseball-type cap and carrying several guns, entered the school's elementary building at 8:30 a.m., accompanied by an unwitting accomplice, and took more than 80 children hostage. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> allowed his companion to leave in the middle of the day but he remained until 8:30 p.m., when officers subdued him as he emerged after hearing a videotaped fae pardon sent from <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> by Gov. Guy Hunt. As the hours of the seige crept along, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> at times allowed groups of hostage children to go free, but at the end Mrs. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>'s and another class _ 26 people in all _ were still in their rooms <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> pleaded guilty in October to charges he kidnapped 110 children and adults at the private school, and was sentenced to a life term and five 20-year terms, with the judge recommending psychiatric help. Two of <PERSON> Carden </PERSON>'s children, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, were in the third and first grades. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> said, does n't seem to show any after-affects but <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> has developed a fear of being left alone at times. When <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> was freed that night, <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> said, the child's only complaint was, `` I did n't get to eat my lunch.'' When released, most children tended to react to their parents' emotions, he said `` The reason some kids were crying was because their parents were crying.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> who was called in that day to try to alleviate concerns of parents, said he believes the children have bounced back remarkably. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of the psychology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> is working with colleagues in other cities where gunmen have appeared at schools to develop ways to help children. `` It's amazing, but there have been very little psychological studies of such things,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to come up with a network to study long-range effects.'' When <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> entered Mrs. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>'s room, she attacked him with a Bible story book before he ordered his accomplice to tie her up with tape. `` I feel like when the children are at school they are my children and I have to take care of them,'' she said. After <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> pleaded guilty, the Madison County Sheriff's Department made Mrs. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> an honorary member, and last week the <ORGANIZATION> Tuscaloosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> gave her a certificate signifying she had done more for law enforcement in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION> in 1988 than anyone other than officers While in the school, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> demanded to see an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter, and told the reporter he was trying to make a statement on behalf of the nation's homeless and hungry. <PERSON> Carden </PERSON>, 35, said in an interview this week that he had expected enrollment to drop because of the takeover, `` but we did n't lose a single student. We have 410 enrolled now compared to 360 then.'' Meanwhile, with the elementary building separate from the rest of the school, <PERSON> Carden </PERSON> has taken steps to try to prevent any recurrence. An inter-com and a telephone line have been installed in the building, and the school's athletic director, `` a big, burly man,'' spends a lot of time there. In addition, `` panic doors'' have been installed, so no one can enter without a key or without being admitted from the inside.

 <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> has been barred from coaching his 10-year-old daughter's intramural basketball team because he has AIDS, but <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> hopes he wo n't be benched for long. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was dismissed last week after only one game as a volunteer coach at <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Already, he has launched a petition drive to get himself reinstated and to protest the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Community Schools policy dealing with AIDS. `` The next step may be to keep me out of the school altogether,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` My daughter will be there for four more years and if we let them defeat us now, I might not ever get to go to the school.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 37, contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from tainted blood products during open-heart surgery in 1984. The disease, which attacks the body's immune system, is transmitted primarily through bodily fluids, such as during sexual contact, intravenous drug use and blood transfusions, but not through casual contact. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> volunteered to coach the team of fourth -, fifth - and sixth-graders when his daughter <PERSON> Dande </PERSON> decided to play at the school, 60 miles southeast of `` I have no physical contact with them at all,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` I might throw a basketball to them, but if they're going to get it that way, we're all in trouble.'' Principal <PERSON> Odell </PERSON> <PERSON> Calihan </PERSON> and Superintendent <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON> refused to comment, saying only that they are following the school district's policy `` I know the situation, but I ca n't comment and I wo n't confirm any names,'' <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON> said when asked about <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s dismissal. `` It's just ignorance,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` They have n't educated themselves on AIDS and how it's transmitted. But the way the disease is spreading, they ought to start getting educated. Four or five years ago, I did n't think I'd ever come down with something like this either.'' A similar argument was made after school authorities in <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> barred young <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> from his classes because he has AIDS. His family later moved to another town and his story was told recently in a television movie. Under the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school district's AIDS policy approved in September, employees suspected of carrying the AIDS virus must submit to a medical examination by a doctor selected by the school board. If an employee tests positive for the virus, a committee decides whether the employee is an immediate public health threat. The superintendent serves on the committee and selects its members, which include a public health physician and school officials. `` If it's not discrimination, I do n't know what is,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` The superintendent chooses who he wants on the committee, so he can select people who support him. I ca n't even go to the meeting to defend myself.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said many of the basketball players' parents have signed a petition to reinstate him as coach. `` I'd like to fight it and win it. But at this point in time, we've been struggling just to make ends meet and we're not going to be able to put out a lot of money,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, whose family lives on his Social Security payments and the salary from his wife's factory job <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, has agreed to coach the team in the meantime, but school officials say she first must be tested for the AIDS virus. Until his case is resolved, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> plans to attend games as a spectator. `` My daughter is on the team and they ca n't keep me from going to the games,'' he said. `` What I do n't understand is what's the difference if I'm sitting on the bench with the team as their coach, telling them when to go in and when to come out, or sitting in the bleachers as a parent with the other kids all around me, eating my popcorn?''

 The patient with the bug in her ear screamed, `` Get that sucker!'' That rang a bell for her doctors who failed to nab the critter with had been considered the best roach approach. The doctors were excited when the woman came to the hospital with a cockroach in her ear. It was their long-awaited chance to try out a squirt of the anesthetic lidocaine, which a report four years ago said was the best way to remove a bug from an ear. `` With hurried anticipation, we sprayed the drug briskly into the ear canal and quickly jumped back, fully expecting the beast to come hurtling forth at first contact with the noxious substance,'' they told their colleagues in a letter in today's New England Journal of Medicine. Alas. Nothing happened. They tried again, this time dousing the intruder with a bigger dose. Still nothing. `` Get that sucker outa my ear!'' the patient screamed. `` What a brilliant idea,'' the doctors agreed. They hooked up a wall suction device and gently slipped the tip into the young women's ear. With a satisfying `` schloop!'' they nabbed the roach. `` Got him!'' the doctors wrote. `` Sure enough, there he was, plastered to the suction tip like a fly to flypaper.''

 Home pregnancy tests are frequently misinterpreted by ordinary people, says a report that questions whether the kits should stay on the market even though they are accurate when interpreted by lab workers. In a letter in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, Drs. <PERSON> Jocelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> of Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mariet </PERSON> <PERSON> Iosefsohn </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said they asked secretaries, clerks, messengers and janitors to analyze 200 urine samples using two brands of home pregnancy kits. Ten percent of the results of one test and 13 percent of the results of the other were wrong. However, when a lab technician used the kits, one was 100 percent accurate. The other kit gave no false results, although the results were indeterminate in four cases. The researchers noted that the manufacturers claim the home kits are 90 percent accurate. `` It seems clear from our observations that the discrepant results produced by laypersons were due more to difficulties in using the home test kits and interpreting results than to problems with the kits themselves,'' they wrote.

<HEAD>Study Concludes Allergies To Blame for All Asthma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A study today concludes that virtually all asthma attacks are triggered by allergies, challenging a widely held belief. Experts have long believed that asthma attacks in children and young adults were usually caused by allergies, while in grownups they were usually thought to have other causes. The study, based on tests of 2,657 people, suggests that all asthma victims have the allergic variety, regardless of age. `` This helps us to understand better why allergic and non-allergic asthma look so much the same,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>. `` It's all the same disease.'' <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, published his results in the New England Journal of Medicine. His team's conclusions were based largely on measurements of an antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, which plays a key role in the allergic response that leads to asthma. Youngsters with asthma have high amounts of IgE, but these levels drop as people get older. The study found that even though older asthmatics' IgE levels seem low compared to children's, they are still higher than those of grownups who are free of asthma. The doctors concluded that because of the adults' relatively high IgE levels, their asthma was caused by allergies. They noted that routine skin tests that are used to pinpoint the cause of allergies frequently fail to show anything wrong. <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> said this is probably because the tests do not include the specific substance _ called an allergen _ that is triggering the attacks. `` The message is pretty simple,'' said <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>. `` For many years, people thought there were two different kinds of asthma, only one of which was an allergy problem. Even when it's not easy to demonstrate what the allergen might be, the immunoglobulin in the blood suggests that virtually all asthma has an allergic basis.'' The finding, if true, may have little effect on how doctors deal with asthma, since allergic and non-allergic asthma are usually treated with the same drugs.

<HEAD>Study Finds Effect of Fish Oil on Inflammation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fish oil's ability to lower the body's production of two important substances that cause inflammation may explain why it sometimes seems to relieve arthritis and other diseases, researchers reported today. The researchers studied the effects in the blood when nine healthy people took 18 fish oil capsules a day for six weeks. `` We found a very dramatic reduction in the ability of their white blood cells to make tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinarello </PERSON>, who reported his study in the New England Journal of Medicine. `` This is the first time that any dietary manipulation has been shown to change the production of these inflammatory compounds.'' Doctors have long noticed that <PERSON> Eskimos </PERSON> and others who eat lots of oily ocean fish have less heart disease than other people. They also are less likely to get arthritis, juvenile diabetes and other diseases that involve overactive inflammatory responses. Some studies suggest that fish oil supplements can lower blood cholesterol, protecting the arteries from damaging buildups. <PERSON> Dinarello </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said the latest work implies that fish oil also protects the heart by reducing inflammation in the arteries that may lead to thickening of the artery walls. Ten weeks after they stopped taking fish oil, the volunteers' production of interleukin-1 had fallen 61 percent and tumor necrosis factor had dropped 40 percent <PERSON> Dinarello </PERSON> cautioned that the study did not include a comparison group, and said other kinds of oil supplements could have similar effects. While tumor necrosis factor was first noticed for its ability to shrink tumors, doctors believe its most important role in the body is causing inflammation in response to injury. Tumor necrosis factor has failed to work as a cancer treatment, and <PERSON> Dinarello </PERSON> said there is no evidence that reducing its levels in the body would increase susceptibility to cancer.

<HEAD>A Search for Jurors Capable of Judgment But Ignorant of History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> courtroom, a judge is looking for that rarest of creatures _ the person who barely knows anything about <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The judge selecting jurors to try <PERSON> North </PERSON> is making some progress, but the question arises: Will the jury that results be a cross-section of the community, capable of rendering an informed judgment? In the legal sense, it will be a jury of North's peers. The law only requires that it be a cross-section of citizens from which no one has been excluded by reason of sex, race or other arbitrary criteria. It need not be people comparable to North in any other way. What Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> seeks is a jury `` ignorant'' of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s activities _ people so removed from world affairs during the summer of 1987 that they were unaware that <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had lied to it, believing his duty to his country required such deception. Such searches are conducted to ensure that jurors do not enter a case prejudiced either for or against a defendant. But in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s case, it means the exclusion of an enormous number of potential jurors who, at one point or another, read or heard something about him Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., who served on the <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and is a former state judge, said the exclusion of knowledgeable people as jurors `` has inherent problems in it and raises real questions,'' but he does n't know the answers He said some people simply do n't watch television out of choice or because they are too busy. `` On the other hand, you have the chance they did n't have any interest and you would think they're lacking in the necessary intelligence to serve on it,'' he said `` Whether they will differ from normal, average jurors remains to be seen,'' he said. `` If a man never saw anything of it, what type of individual is he?'' Others go further. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON>, a well-known criminal defense lawyer, questions whether a fair verdict can be rendered by people who knew nothing about the Iran-Contra affair before stepping into <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s courtroom. `` I would n't want people who lived in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the seat of government, on that jury who were so uninformed,'' said <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON>. `` Are they going to be interested in what goes on inside the courtroom if they were so uninterested for so long on what went on outside it?'' <PERSON> Moffitt </PERSON> said justice would be better served if six of the jurors could be drawn from the uninformed and six from those who followed the Iran-Contra affair, though he concedes that is not practical. On the other hand, say some legal experts, the jury system works well even with jurors who, for whatever reason, arrive innocent of knowledge of the case. `` Jurors are asked to bring a certain common sense into the jury room and try to determine whether a particular story makes sense and look witnesses in the eye to tell who is telling the truth,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacovara </PERSON>, a former prosecutor in the Watergate trial, another case drenched in publicity before it reached trial. `` It is not necessary for people to be highly educated or current in world affairs to make that assessment,'' <PERSON> Lacovara </PERSON> said. `` It's a burden to find qualified jurors, but I'm not saying it ca n't be done,'' added <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFave </PERSON>, a criminal law expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>. `` Do n't forget that all the pre-trial publicity has n't been unfavorable,'' added <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Do n't forget the movement to pardon North. Not many people facing serious felony charges are asked to speak in support of the re-election of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. So the government has to be as careful about prejudiced jurors as the defense.'' The jury's ignorance of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s activities is crucial because he was compelled to talk to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' Iran-Contra committees. In exchange, he was given limited immunity, a promise that his testimony would not be used against him in court. Prosecutors developed their case independently and charged <PERSON> North </PERSON> with obstructing presidential and congressional inquiries, lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and shredding evidence. For all the attention focused on North, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, before the trial started, expressed confidence that an unknowing jury could be found to hear the facts and draw its own conclusions. He said the same questions were raised in the Watergate case, but a jury was found, a verdict was rendered and justice was done.

Scientists believe condors lay eggs 30 to 35 days after fertilization, but mating does n't necessarily result in fertilization, <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said. The seven Andean condors, donated by zoos across the nation, were freed into rugged mountains 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in an experiment meant to help biologists learn the best way to handle, release and monitor <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors once they reproduce in adequate numbers. About 1,000 to 2,000 of the wild Andean birds remain in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The most recent release was Jan. 21, when biologists removed netting from a roost box and feeding platform that housed four Andean condors in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary. On the same day, a hostile encounter occurred between two golden eagles and one of three other Andeans, which had been freed Dec. 17 from the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Hopper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said. The 10-month-old Andean, condor Y1, flew from <LOCATION> Hopper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> onto the eagles' turf, where `` the eagles made several ` stoops,' or aggressive drives, toward the condor and forced it to the ground,'' said a Fish and Wildlife Service news release. <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said the condor soon returned to the air and `` made a beeline to the security of its home -LRB- roost box -RRB-. It was intimidated by the eagles,'' which have 5-foot wingspans. The Andean condors, which will be recaptured and re-released in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when the experiment ends next year, will encounter a number of other birds in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s mountains and `` recognize some will be territorial and others may serve as pilots to where food is present,'' he said. There has n't been much flight activity among the four Andeans released Jan. 21, <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said. Condor R4 immediately flew 120 feet into a brushy thicket and could n't figure out how to get back to her roost box. Biologists caught her Tuesday and returned her to the box, where <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said `` she ate right away _ carcasses of stillborn calves.'' <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said it will be months before the biologists place food for the carrion-eating condors away from their roost boxes in an effort to teach them to forage. Two of the three Andeans freed from <LOCATION> Hopper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in December flew about three miles on Tuesday and passed over the Sespe roost box, but the four condors there `` did n't notice them. They were sleeping,'' <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said. Back at the zoos, the six males court the females by arching their necks, looking at the ground, and trying to encircle the females with their outstretched wings. <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said each female `` will try to come up under the male and nibble at his beak. That's a positive reaction. <PERSON> Dowhan </PERSON> said the breeding season runs from January to April.

<HEAD>Origin Of Dolphin-Killing Red Tide Puzzles Experts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists say they are certain that a natural poison caused the massive die-off of bottlenose dolphins in 1987 and 1988, but they still are puzzled by the persistence of the deadly `` red tide'' that arose in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and moved up the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` We have never found this before in history,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON>, a wildlife specialist who headed a team of federal researchers. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON> said laboratory findings confirm that the dolphins that died had eaten fish contaminated with a powerful poison, called brevertoxin, originating from the persistent bloom of red tide algae. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a federal fisheries expert, estimated that 50 percent of the dolphins living off the coast were killed, and said it could take 100 years for their numbers to recover. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials said laboratory findings `` are unequivocal'' about the cause of death, but just why the red tide made its rare and lethal invasion of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is not known. Fisheries expert <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said red tides occur naturally, but are normally confined to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> where they arise and decline swiftly. But the 1987 red tide persisted for months, moved with the gulf current from the west coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and then was driven northward along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said satellite photographs show that eddies of warm water lingered for long periods off the coast of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and neighboring states and that this may have enabled the algae to continue blooming. Occasionally, he said, the eddies would be shoved into coastal bays, bringing toxin-contaminated fish into dolphin feeding grounds. A red tide is considered dangerous for oyster fishing in the gulf if the count of cells reaches 5,000 per liter of water, <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> said. During the time the dolphins were dying, he said, some tests along the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast found cell counts of more than 20 million per liter. Bottlenose dolphins are mammals that live in the water. They breathe air, give birth to live young and nurse their calves. The animal is highly intelligent and is popular in marine shows because it is easily trained and is long-lived. During the summer of 1987, hundreds of dead and dying dolphins washed onto beaches on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The massive die-off alarmed officials and led to the formation of an investigative team of more than 100 scientists from several federal agencies. <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON> said it took the team 18 months and thousands of laboratory tests to confirm that red tide toxin killed the animals. The dolphins, said <PERSON> Geraci </PERSON>, either `` died as a direct consequence of the toxin'' or were poisoned by it `` and lived long enough to become weakened and susceptible to other organisms,'' such as bacteria and viruses. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said the poison seemed to affect younger dolphins, aged 3 to 6 years, more than others. Some nursing calves died from their mothers' toxin-poisoned milk. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said that though only 742 dolphin bodies were found along the beaches, it is likely that hundreds upon hundreds of others died unseen just offshore. `` The population was reduced on the order of 50 percent,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. `` The recovery to the original stock levels could take from 14 to 100 years.''

 The local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appear at odds over how to proceed with a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student suspected of creating a virus that paralyzed 6,000 computers nationwide. The difference has to do with whether <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, should be charged with a felony to deter similar computer attacks, or whether he should be offered a plea bargain and provide information under a grant of immunity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has requested <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval to offer <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> the chance to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and has granted him limited immunity, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said Wednesday, confirming a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The limited immunity grant `` caused a lot of consternation down here,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, unlawful access to a government computer can result in a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $ 250,000 fine. If fraud is proved, the punishment can reach a maximum of 20 years in prison. `` As far as we're concerned, the legal problem was still intent,'' the source said. He added that the officials were uncertain whether <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had planned to create and spread the virus last November that infected a government computer network. A computer virus is a tiny program that spreads throughout computer networks and disrupts their normal operation. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who is on a leave of absence from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> and living with his parents in <LOCATION> Arnold </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, has told friends that he created the virus but did n't intend for it to invade computers around the nation. The virus that began Nov. 2, 1988, infected 6,000 university and military computers nationwide connected by the ARPANET network, which is used for transmission of non-classified data among universities and military contractors. The system was virtually shut down for several days, but no information was destroyed. ARPANET is part of INTERNET, which has another network called MILNET, used by military facilities. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who is considering what charges should be brought, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, referred questions to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to discuss the case because it is an ongoing investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said he understood the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which enforces the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, was extremely upset over the limited immunity grant to <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scullin </PERSON> was out of his office Wednesday afternoon and not available for comment, his secretary said. `` The matter is still pending before the department,'' said department spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney for <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, said no plea bargain had been worked out. `` They have not told me what they've recommended, and I've not offered on behalf of my client to plead guilty to anything,'' he said. `` I have told them we wo n't plead guilty to a felony. I'm very emphatic about that.'' He refused to confirm or deny that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> had spoken with prosecutors. Phone calls Wednesday to the <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> home in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> went unanswered. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, chief computer scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, did not immediately return a phone call to his office. <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> is on a year-long leave of absence from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>, where he was a graduate student in computer science. `` He's doing as well as can be expected under the circumstances,'' he said, noting that <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has a temporary job but `` would like to get the case resolved.'' <PERSON> Guidoboni </PERSON> said he did n't know if the temporary job involved work with computers.

<HEAD>Congressional Agency Pegs 1990 Deficit Higher than Reagan Did</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last budget would produce a deficit far larger than the law allows and would not produce a surplus by 1993 as the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has claimed. Using gloomier economic projections than those employed by the administration, the nonpartisan <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spending plan would create a $ 120 billion shortfall in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, and leave $ 80 billion in red ink by 1993 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> projected a $ 92.5 billion imbalance for next year and a $ 2 billion surplus in 1993, the year the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law requires a balanced budget. Gramm-Rudman sets a $ 100 billion deficit limit for 1990. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president fail to whittle the deficit to within $ 10 billion of that amount, automatic spending cuts occur that reduce the imbalance to $ 100 billion. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will submit his budget plan a week from today, and his blueprint _ not <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s _ will dominate this year's budget battles between the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal _ and <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>'s examination of it _ retains some significance for two reasons. First of all, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides have said they are likely to use the economic forecasts used by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, projections that many private economists and congressional fiscal experts say are too optimistic. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION>'s report shows just how far apart <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his congressional foes are likely to be when the debate begins over needed savings. Secondly, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will incorporate large chunks of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal in his own plan. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> also said that: _ This year's budget deficit will be $ 159 billion, about $ 2 billion lower than the administration projects <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> had projected the 1989 deficit at $ 155 billion just last month, but increased that figure based on expectations of higher spending for agriculture, housing and the savings and loan crisis. _ If none of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposals is adopted, next year's deficit would be $ 146 billion, $ 5 billion more than the office projected last month, and would shrink only slightly to $ 135 billion by 1993 The administration has said the deficit, without <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed savings, would be $ 127 billion next year and $ 37 billion in 1993. _ The government would spend $ 1.19 trillion next year under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan, $ 38 billion more than the administration estimated _ The government will collect $ 11 billion more in revenues than the $ 1.059 trillion estimated by the White House _ The cost of bailing out the nation's financially ailing savings and loan associations will cost $ 11 billion more next year than the administration estimated The CBO figures are often used by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to argue that the administration deficit forecast is too optimistic and that more savings are needed. Nonetheless, the Gramm-Rudman law requires the use of the administration's figures when calculating the deficit. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in recent years has ultimately accepted the administration's figures, thus making it easier to create savings. The administration has forecast that the economy will grow at a rate of 3.2 percent this calendar year, that inflation will be 3.8 percent and that short-term interest rates will drop to 6.3 percent, two points below current interest rates. <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> used a forecast that included 2.9 percent growth for the economy, an inflation rate of 4.9 percent and 7.9 percent short-term interest rates.

 Some backers of the 50 percent pay raise for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> say they need it because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is such an expensive place. Lucky for them the Capitol is n't in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Or <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Or <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. All of those places are even more expensive than <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, according to various private studies that index the cost of living in cities around the country Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> currently are paid $ 89,500 a year, except for congressional leaders who earn more. If the proposed pay raise goes through, their pay will jump 50 percent to $ 135,000. Many argue that the costs of keeping up homes back in their district and in the Capitol strain their budgets. But they also argue that just living in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> or its <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburbs is a strain, too. Whether they should n't have to make do is another question. But they do get some private support for their argument that the city is among the most expensive places in the nation to live. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which produces quarterly cost comparisons for 263 urban areas, puts <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at close to the top _ with above standard costs in all categories including housing, groceries, utilities, transportation, health care and miscellaneous goods and services. The chamber's report for the third quarter of 1988, the most recent available, established a composite index of 127.2 for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ based on a scale with 100 the nationwide average. Thus they rate <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 27 percent more expensive than average. Among the big cities, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was rated the highest, at 164.1, followed by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> at 144.7 and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> at 127.7. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was just behind at 123.9. <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, were just ahead of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at 129.2. The biggest item in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is housing, which the chamber says is 68 percent higher than average. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> it's 225 percent higher than average. There are private companies that make their own cost calculations and make recommendations to businesses on salaries when moving employees or setting pay for different cities. One of them, <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a management consulting firm based in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, made such a comparison for congressional salaries. It established a basic mean for expenses in the country and called it <LOCATION> Standard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S.A </LOCATION>. If a person there with a family of four was earning $ 89,500, and then got elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and moved to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION> figures he or she would need to earn $ 101,681 to maintain the same standard of living. That's 14 percent more. If the same family had moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Runzheimer </ORGANIZATION> figures it would need $ 115,296, or 29 percent more. For <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, it would need $ 117,625, or 31 percent more. `` That's to continue the same lifestyle he would have, to live in the same size house, drive the same car, have the same expenditure pattern,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, director of consulting services for the company. Still another way to compare would be to look at the costs of homes, the biggest budget item for most families. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>' figures for the third quarter of 1988 showed the median price for existing single-family homes in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area was $ 135,800, above the national median of $ 90,200. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was ninth on the Realtors' list of housing prices, behind <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. It was among the most rapidly escalating in costs, too, with that median home price up more than 15 percent in one year.

 When <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> blows her whistle, bank presidents stand on chairs, attorneys howl and nurses roar like lions, blow passionate kisses and shoot the air with their fingers like gunslingers. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, a registered nurse from <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is a humor consultant whose mission is to rid the world of boredom and help employees lighten up and enjoy their work. `` Inside the crankiest, grumpiest, grouchiest person you know is a child who's dying to get out and enjoy himself,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said Wednesday at a seminar for nurses at a nursing home in this <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb. `` We're not proposing people tell jokes at work or create a circus,'' she said. `` But we are proposing that people have an opportunity to express all that they are _ from tears to laughters, the whole spectrum of feeling.'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> spreads her gospel of humor in lectures, conferences and workshops, and has looked for the funny bone in such unlikely places as the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. Acting more like a stand-up comic than a consultant Wednesday, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> prodded her audience of 100 nurses and other health-care professionals into acting silly. She encouraged them to seek support by asking for a standing ovation or express boredom by making a sign that looked a lot like someone picking their nose. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said she knows many people may feel `` this overwhelming urge to bolt for the door'' when she requests particularly unusual behavior, so she does n't require a response. Few people, however, just sat back and watched. `` I set up ground rules for people where they only do what feels safe to them,'' she said. As she bounced from one routine to the next, trading one goofy mask for another, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> cited research that indicates humor can help in the healing process while stress can delay recovery. `` The prediction is that by the year 2,000, 80 percent of workmen's compensation claims will be stress related,'' she said. `` We need to find a new way of doing business in this country that supports people being whole, healthy, happy, satisfied, so that they come to work and find they really have an opportunity to express themselves, to impact the world, to make a difference. And humor is a part of that.'' Research supports the theory that laughter is important for good health. Laughter releases endorphins, which are natural painkillers and help the body deal with stress. Recent studies show that people who can laugh it up under pressure seem to have greater resistance to stress-related ailments, and that humor therapy helps relieve painful muscle-bone disorders and depression. A good hearty laugh provides a mini-workout by exercising the diaphragm, thorax, abdomen, heart and lungs. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> suggested nurses try a little humor on the job. Taking vital signs while wearing a clown nose or writing with a pen shaped like an eggplant can bring a smile to most people's faces, she said. `` Patients love it. Walk into a patient's room and tell a joke and everyone in all the beds will be paying attention, even the person who is hearing impaired,'' she said with a laugh. `` Everyone wants to get into the act.'' `` I'm not ready to walk into a patient's room with a clown nose, but I think she reminded us that we need to lighten up,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, a nurse from suburban <PERSON> Dormont </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Price Rises Offset Some Drought Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last summer's devastating heat and drought shriveled crop production, but in some cases market prices rose enough to offset much of the financial loss, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. In the case of 1988 corn production, for example, the harvest dropped 30 percent to 4.92 billion bushels. The average yield was cut to 84.6 bushels per acre from the record of 119.4 bushels in 1987. But the corn crop nationally was worth more than $ 13 billion, down only about 7 percent from its value in 1987 of slightly less than $ 14 billion. It's a big-stakes numbers game, of course, with losers and winners. A farmer who was wiped out entirely had no corn to sell at the higher prices. But many did have something to sell, and that's what <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s national figures are about _ averages, and how those stack up from one year to the next The department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported on Tuesday that the $ 13 billion corn harvest of 1988 was valued at $ 2.60 per bushel, compared with $ 1.94 for the 1987 crop. Analysts cautioned that the prices used in the report are based on preliminary averages during the marketing year and do n't take into account <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> price supports and other benefits. Moreover, the `` value'' of a crop is basically determined by multiplying production by price. It is not the same as cash sales by farmers. For example, if a farmer had a 100,000-bushel corn crop and fed part or all of it to livestock, the corn would still have a production value _ whether used or sold. Overall, the report showed that major crops in 1988 had a production value of $ 70.2 billion, up from $ 68.5 billion in 1987. A dozen carried a production value last year of $ 1 billion or more, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total. Rounded off, those included: corn, $ 13 billion; soybeans, $ 11.9 billion; hay, $ 10.6 billion; wheat, $ 6.63 billion; cotton, $ 4.1 billion; tobacco, $ 2.2 billion; potatoes, $ 1.92 billion; oranges, $ 1.69 billion; grapes, $ 1.37 billion; sorghum, $ 1.36 billion; apples, $ 1.22 billion; and rice, $ 1.04 billion. Other examples of 1988 production values included: oats, $ 562.3 million, down from $ 606 million in 1987; barley, $ 790,295, down from $ 982.3 million; and dry edible beans, $ 571 million, up from $ 426.4 million. Some drought states declined in crop production value much more than others last year. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, for example, was reported at $ 4.81 billion for 1988, down only 2 percent from $ 4.89 billion in 1987. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, severely hit by drought, was shown at $ 1.2 billion, down from $ 1.93 billion in 1987, a 37 percent drop. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> showed an increase in crop production value to nearly $ 3.7 billion from less than $ 2.9 billion in 1987. By states, here are the comparisons of total crop production values, in thousands of dollars. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was not listed. The first column is for 1987 and the second column is for 1988.

 If you did n't know that today is National No Talk Day, you're not alone. The third-grade teacher who founded the holiday does n't talk much about it. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachelor </PERSON> came up with the idea for the annual bit of peace and quiet 13 years ago. `` It was a dull time and I wanted to do something to bring my students to life, to give them a challenge,'' she recalled. So she told her class at <ORGANIZATION> Garner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> to write notes and play charades for one entire day, except during recess. Celebrated on the first Thursday in February, the holiday is likely to be overshadowed this year by a better-known holiday, Groundhog Day.

 Nobody noticed that flags were disappearing from <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> until police spotted two college fraternity brothers at the top of a flagpole. `` We did n't know flags were being stolen,'' police Capt. <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Canestrino </PERSON> said Wednesday as he announced the recovery of 10 stolen flags.

<TEXT>
 A proposed joint operating agreement between <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two major newspapers raises issues so significant they deserve another hearing on appeal, says a motion filed by a coalition of readers and advertisers to delay the deal. The motion filed Wednesday by the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> says the 100-year agreement between The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> would cost 500 jobs, cause higher subscription and newsstand prices and probably lead to higher advertising rates. For their part, the two newspapers would suffer `` comparatively little harm'' should the agreement to combine business and production operations be put off past the scheduled Monday completion of the agreement, opponents said in their motion. Under the agreement, the papers would maintain separate news and editorial departments. A three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> on Friday rejected opponents' argument that the partial merger should be forbidden. The court said the attorney general had the power to interpret the Newspaper Preservation Act, the law under which the newspapers applied for an exemption from federal anti-trust laws. The opponents argued that the appeals panel gave the attorney general undue power. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said through a spokesman that the delay is costing about $ 50,000 a day. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the News, declined comment from its <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, headquarters

 The anticipated appointment of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> as the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs shows the desire of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to forge a bipartisan policy in that region, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, a Democrat and one-time aide to former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, is best known for helping President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> build congressional support for military aid for the Contras in the summer of 1986. It was the last time such aid won approval on Capitol Hill. Although early signs are that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not seek a renewal of Contra aid and instead will seek a diplomatic solution in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> is viewed on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as a moderate who could appeal to members of both parties. The anticipated appointment of <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> comes at a time when both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government are showing signs of interest in a more accommodating relationship, possibly including the first direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in four years. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had considered a long list of alternate candidates for the post before settling on <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> to become assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, widely regarded as one of the most demanding jobs in government. The selection of <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> indicates that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are intent on avoiding the kind of friction with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that accompanied the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's support of the Contra rebels. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has indicated that he believes the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's inability to come up with a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy acceptable to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was a major contributing factor to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inability to achieve its objectives in that region He has been engaged in consultations with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and has elicited favorable comments from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, D-Tex., who helped engineer the defeat of the Contra aid request a year ago Former Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> has called that vote perhaps his biggest disappointment in 3 -LCB- years as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top aide for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> He maintains that the Sandinista government responded to the vote by increasing repression, accelerating aid to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and continuing to accept disproportionately high levels of military aid from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He lists the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> aid figure at $ 500 million. One long-time Contra aid opponent, Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., said he is cautiously optimistic he will be able to work well with <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> from 1977 to 1981 was a vice presidential speechwriter and deputy assistant to President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and currently is on a Council on Foreign Relations study group on Central America. The officials who confirmed his appointment spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure appears to have had a dramatic impact on Sandinista attitudes, including its policy towards <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas announced on Inauguration Day that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be allowed to send envoys to replace eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats who were expelled from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> last July. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said last week he wants to `` normalize all aspects of U.S.-Nicaraguan relations,'' and he also has announced cutbacks in military spending, a sore point for the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for years. Contra fighters, many of whom are languishing at camps inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, will be welcomed home without conditions, he said. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> extended a unilateral cease-fire with the Contras and lifted suspensions on two radio programs that had been in effect since last fall and drawn critical <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> comment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, has said little about <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since he began his election campaign last year, leaving the impression that he does not subscribe to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s view that the Sandinista government, left unchecked, will eventually represent a major security threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Leading Southern Democrats are lining up to help <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> counter complaints about his liberal ties and smooth his transition to the chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Govs. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> planned to greet <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as he opened a two-day swing through the region where his links to <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> produced the most objections from conservative Democrats. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of elected and party officials around the country found strong support for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, coupled with advice that he quickly establish his independence and demonstrate a commitment to keep the party in the political mainstream. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s four rivals for the party chairmanship have dropped out of the race, leaving him a sure winner when the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> elects a successor to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Feb. 10. `` He's a terrific guy and will do a great job,'' said Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> also suggested that the task ahead for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will not be easy. `` I just think the party is in more difficult shape than it has admitted nationally,'' he said. `` I think the general drift of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since the mid'60s has been downward nationwide. I think that large numbers of people are feeling that in the national scheme of things, we're not speaking to them.'' While Democrats control the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and hold a majority of the nation's governorships, they have lost five of the last six presidential elections. Southern states have voted solidly <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> in recent presidential contests. `` If we want to win we have to bring the so-called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats home,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. He called <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s man'' but said the incoming party chairman will demonstrate his independence if he works hard to find a presidential candidate who appeals to moderate and conservative Democrats. `` He was not my choice,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, `` but I look forward to working with him.'' <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to appoint a task force to address the concerns of party moderates. `` I think we should give him a chance to address the concerns of those who are out there,'' said <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Campaign committee. `` If he does n't, thenhe'll be open to criticism.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager last summer and received credit for helping bring the session to a harmonious close. He was general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was chairman and then served as deputy manager of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> senator's 1980 presidential campaign. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s ties to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> triggered suggestions he would make it more difficult for Democrats to shake an image that the party was too liberal. `` His ideology as far as I'm concerned is insignificant,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` His task is simply to get in there and get the party organized. His role is to build an organization that can win elections.'' `` I do n't know <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>. `` But people I've talked to are concerned it might hurt us.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said there is a conservative trend in the country and `` a lot of people are concerned we're moving away from the national trend. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, talk of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s liberalism was n't an issue. `` That question might be better asked of whites in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, director of the nonpartisan <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said the identity of the national chairman `` has damned little to do with the state party.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellstone </PERSON>, who was a leader of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said the fact <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> is black `` is an issue for many people in the country. ... Race is a huge factor in American politics, more than most of us want to admit to. The sooner the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> confronts it the better off we are.'' `` It's a very positive step for us to pick a black chairman,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` That's because we do n't look at <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as simply being black. We look upon him as someone who can unite all Democrats and put it together.''

<HEAD>Board Rules Cocaine Use Contributed to 1988 Colorado Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> says cocaine use by the pilot of a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> commuter flight contributed to a crash that killed nine people. The five-member board reached the conclusion after a year's investigation into the Jan. 19, 1988, crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Colorado </ORGANIZATION> flight into <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, in which the pilot, co-pilot and seven passengers died Eight passengers survived. The decision came even though investigators said the cocaine found in pilot <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>'s blood and urine was insufficient to make him `` high'' during the flight and co-pilot <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> was controlling the <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> 3 aircraft before it crashed into a hill five miles short of the <LOCATION> Durango </LOCATION> runway. `` Contributing to the accident was the degradation of the captain's performance resulting from his use of cocaine before the accident,'' the board said. It blamed both `` the first officer's flying and the captain's ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized approach which resulted in a descent below the published descent profile. The board said the plane began its descent at too high an altitude and speed to land safely. Investigators found no problem with the aircraft or air traffic control instructions that might have contributed to the crash but raised some questions about the landing approach path the pilot chose to use. The board asked the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to examine procedures that approved the steep `` slam-dunk'' approach used by the now-defunct airline, called for more <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> assistance in screening of pilots and urged greater dissemination of information about detecting drug use among airline personnel. The board opposes random drug testing of all airplane crew members as called for in a program set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, saying it prefers testing before employment, after accidents and when warranted by a `` wide range of safety related errors.'' Investigators said <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, 36, lied about previous drunken driving convictions to obtain a medical certification to fly and noted that co-pilot <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s record of training with Trans-Colorado and previous employment indicated `` deficiences in performing instrument procedures.'' The plane leased by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, crashed at night in light snow. The board staff also noted that <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, 42, had a history of alcoholism although no evidence of alcohol was found in either crew member's body. Family members and friends said earlier that <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> had overcome his alcoholism. The board, in its conclusions and recommendations, did not address drug testing, but member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> noted board disagreement with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> program. The program requires drug testing of all airplane crew members during first medical evaluations and random testing thereafter. Medical analysis after the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> crash found traces of cocaine in the pilot's blood and urine, investigators said. They also said a girlfriend of the pilot reportedly claimed he had taken cocaine the night before the crash, although she refused to talk to investigators. Board investigator <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauch </PERSON> said evidence showed that Silver had used cocaine between 10 and 18 hours before the flight. He said there was not enough evidence to determine whether <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> was a heavy user of the drug. Board staff member <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> <PERSON> Birky </PERSON>, a chemical expert, said that regular use of cocaine could cause fatigue and a preoccupation with cocaine, affecting performance of a pilot long after any `` high.'' Two negligence lawsuits have been filed against <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as a result of the crash. Both cites Silver's cocaine use. One also alleges that the airline failed to check records of both Silver and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar weakened against the Japanese yen Thursday, while stock prices rebounded moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar opened at 130.15 yen, and traded in a wide range between 129.67 yen and 130.23 yen before closing at 129.75 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's close of 130.40 yen. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which lost 220.62 points on Wednesday, climbed 137.62 points, or 0.44 percent, on Thursday and closed at 31,498.30. Exchange dealers said the dollar was still bearish but players were cautious about trading ahead of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> major industrialized countries scheduled for Friday. The meeting, to be attended by finance ministers and central bank heads from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, will likely focus on the recent fluctuation in currency rates. Dealers said many market players were also sidelined because of the upcoming Friday release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment figures for January. They added that securities players on the stock market were also inactive because of the meeting and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment rates announcement. `` The most bullish shares today -LRB- Thursday -RRB- were ones which lost substantial points yesterday,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese brokerage, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Players seem to be trying carefully to determine the direction of the February market.''

<HEAD>EPA Wants to Ban Use of Alar on Apples</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Growers who welcomed Alar 20 years ago because it made apples firmer, better looking and less likely to spoil will have to come up with a substitute because of concern the chemical causes cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it plans to order a ban on the chemical, formally known as daminozide, but that the regulatory process is likely to take 18 months or more. The agency is meanwhile urging growers to voluntarily stop using the chemical. According to current <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and industry estimates, only about 5 percent of the more than 200 million bushels of apples grown each year are sprayed with the chemical. Four years ago it was found on about 35 percent of the apple crop. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said the health risks of continued Alar use have been calculated to produce an estimated five additional deaths from cancer over a lifetime for every 100,000 people exposed. The risk for children is likely greater because they consume more apples and apple products such as juice or sauce, he said. `` There is an inescapable and direct correlation between exposure ... and the development of life-threatening tumors in test mice,'' he continued, citing preliminary results of a series of tests still under way. The first indication from laboratory tests on animals that there might be a link to cancer came in l977. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said in the early l980s that it planned to review whether Alar should be taken off the market, finally directing a ban three years ago, only to back off after its test data were brought into question. In recent years many apple processors, who provide apples for juices and sauces as well as baby food, have refused to buy Alar-treated apples. So have some grocery chains because of the health concern, said <PERSON> Derl </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Alar, which is absorbed into the apple, began being used extensively by apple growers in the early l970s to spur even growth, reduce spoilage and help preserve apples so they can be sold all year. <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, the only producer of Alar, disputes that a health risk has been proven. `` All the studies that have been done since 1985 have supported our position that Alar poses no significant health risk,'' said Uniroyal spokesman <PERSON> Yanis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bibelnieks </PERSON>. He said it was `` inappropriate to make any judgment based on interim results'' cited by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the company has no plans to take the produce off the market. The company produces 75 percent less Alar today than it did in l985 because fewer growers now use it, he said. A lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which has filed a lawsuit to stop Alar's use, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> for not taking emergency action to ban the product immediately. `` EPA has a sufficient amount of data to take this chemical off the market today,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>, an attorney for the Washington-based group. `` It's a very hazardous cancer-causing chemical. ... Any further debate should occur in the courts after the product is off the market.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, where a third of the country's apples are grown, industry representatives said many growers likely will stop for fear of future legal liabilies and a possible public backlash. `` We know it's a greast tool for us to use, but by the same token if it's going to hurt our image we do n't need it,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> celebrated the 10th anniversary of its Islamic revolution by marking the minute <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> arrived home from exile. Millions of the 88-year-old leader's supporters cheered, rang bells, exploded fireworks at the appointed hour Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said. There were sports tournaments, cultural festivals and street reenactments of revolutionary events. The celebrations will climax Feb. 11, the anniversary of the day the last government formed by the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> collapsed and the revolutionaries took over to proclaim the Islamic republic. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, living at that time in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, returned to triumph in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. But the festivities that began at 9:03 a.m. Wednesday to mark the minute <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> touched Iranian soil a decade earlier come at a deeply troubling time. Infighting between pragmatists in the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> hierarchy and radicals has led to a wave of political executions and a bitter power struggle that is expected to flare when <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> dies. The nation also is struggling to recover from a devastating eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which ended after a humiliating military collapse by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that forced it to accept a cease-fire on Aug. 20. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s failure to defeat <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> led some pragmatists to abandon the goal of exporting the Islamic revolution to the Moslem world through militant action. It also led the moderates to call for less religious, political and social restrictions and for normalization of relations with the West. Still, the revolution has survived the internal upheaval, the hostility of much of the world and the punishing war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which left hundreds of thousands of Iranians killed or mutilated. `` This year we celebrate a decade of resistance and struggle against the enemies of humanity,'' Culture Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatami </PERSON> said earlier this week. `` We celebrate the 10th year of a revolution which has been strengthened by thousands of martyrs and thousands of disabled.'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s streets, spruced up by teams of workers, were decked out in <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> flags, revolutionary posters and portraits of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> did not say what <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was doing to mark the day of his triumphant return two weeks after the shah left <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to go into exile, his regime crumbling from within, his army unable to quell the revolution. The celebrations came as dissident factions claimed that Parliament <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, whose pragmatic faction holds the upper hand in the political struggle, has been executing hundreds of opponents, including supporters of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseil-Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s designated successor and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s rival. The anniversary also comes as <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> attempts to normalize <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s relations with the West and the Soviet bloc. He said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is ready to restore relations with <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which broke ties 10 months ago after accusing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of subversion and terrorism.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Says Leave Tax Overhaul Alone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The proposal by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to cut the capital-gains tax could cause the 1986 tax overhaul to unravel, a key architect of that legislation says. `` I want to retain the'86 act because this is the first year the full force and effect of that legislation will take place,'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. If the capital-gains tax is reduced, he suggested, there is a real possibility that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would couple it with an increase in the top individual tax rates. `` That bothers me,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> said, when a questioner at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesaler-Distributors </ORGANIZATION> asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. The president says he will ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the 33 percent top tax rate on capital gains to 15 percent. `` That scares me,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said. To applause from the audience, he said his talks with business leaders make clear that the best thing to do with the tax law now is leave it alone. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> was one of the chief authors of the 1986 tax overhaul, which reduced tax rates significantly and cut or eliminated several deductions, exclusions and credits. Among those changes was wiping out the preferential rate for capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other property.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said Thursday he was leaving for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> for a meeting requested by deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was in critical condition in a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospital. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was `` very, very weak'' and placed on a respirator Wednesday after emergency surgery at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON>. But President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> gave no indication she was prepared to lift the ban against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> returning from exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and said the former president's condition `` is neither critical nor serious.'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said in a statement that he had informed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and Executive Secretary <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> of his trip and would immediately relay to her <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' message. Since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> could not communicate directly with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, `` he is asking me to help communicate with the Filipino people,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> was acting on his own and not as an emissary of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, telephoned him from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> requesting the urgent meeting because doctors had advised <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` that he has n't much time left to live.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 59, fainted while accompanying her husband to the emergency tracheotomy, and fell and hit her head, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. She was listed in satisfactory condition in the same hospital. Laurel's statement followed rumors in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> that he and Filipino industrialist <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> were trying to work out a deal under which <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> could be allowed to return. `` If what <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> wants to convey to -LRB- Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> -RRB- and the nation will heal the wounds that have been fragmenting our people and finally lead to national reconciliation, then something good can come out of this trip,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. A spokesman said the vice president, whose relations with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> have been strained since he quit her Cabinet in 1987, was to depart later Thursday. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been living in exile since a February 1986 civilian-military uprising ended his 20-year rule and swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return for reasons of national security. The 71-year-old former president was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 15 for treatment of pneumonia and bronchial asthma. In December, he was hospitalized twice for treatment of congestive heart failure. In October, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife were indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on racketeering charges for allegedly embezzling $ 103 million from the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government to purchase real estate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent before a federal judge later that month, but <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' arraignment has been postponed because of his health. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government accuses the Marcoses of robbing the country of up to $ 10 billion during their rule and demands the return of the `` ill-gotten'' wealth as a condition for allowing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' return.

 The Arctic air mass that created havoc in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> before moving to the lower 48 froze fountains in usually mild <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> residents tried to dig out from under a foot of snow. Officials attributed at least 13 deaths to the cold and driving winds that have paralyzed much of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since Monday. Cold and blowing snow was blamed for eight deaths in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Among the dead were six <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> men who suffered heart attacks after shoveling or pushing vehicles. The snow that fell Monday and Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION> area was the heaviest January storm recorded there since Jan. 31, 1885. Most roads and highways in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> were open on Wednesday, although about 20,000 residents in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fraser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> were without power due to high winds that blew trees and branches onto the lines. In <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, the fountain in front of the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> legislature was frozen solid as the mercury dipped to 10 degrees on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Temperatures remained around minus 22 on Wednesday throughout <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, where the wind-chill factor made it cold enough to freeze exposed flesh in less than a minute. `` What has happened the last couple days is quite spectacular,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radomski </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He said the air had a chance to cool longer than usual in the north because it was trapped by westerly circulation that kept most of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> warm much of the winter. The upper level winds then shifted and forced the cold air south at last. `` It has affected all of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and in fact is going to the states and will affect them as well,'' <PERSON> Radomski </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Radomski </PERSON> said the weather pattern generally was heading south and southeast from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and was expected to hit hardest the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, the Lower Great Lakes and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The cold air that lingered over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> for a week broke temperature records and resulted in at least one death. On Monday, it was 51 below zero in <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said there were unofficial reports of temperatures of minus 75 in the state.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will shut its <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> auto assembly plant in August for an indefinite period and lay off about 2,000 workers because it has not decided what cars or trucks to make at the facility. Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to go to the plant today to assure employees he will work to `` reduce the uncertainty associated with layoffs.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials announced Wednesday that they would be stopping production at the plant, which makes the <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Oldsmobile </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutlass </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciera </PERSON>, about 300 cars a day. `` There is no product allocated to the <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> facility after we build out the 89 model,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Dilworth </PERSON>, a spokesman for the automaker. A government official, speaking on condition on anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may request federal aid for the workers and hoped to set up meetings with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> to discuss long-term plans for the plant. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has had some success with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> before. When he returned to office in 1983, the plant was closed. But after negotiations between the state, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials, the plant reopened later that year. It closed again in November 1987 and reopened last May. It currently has 2,100 active employees. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, plant manager, said a transition program will be developed for plant employees to provide them with benefits information and counseling. <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a plant spokesman, said between 100 and 200 employees will remain on the payroll in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> after August to handle security, staff the fire brigade and administer employee benefit and placement programs. <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> is about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` We'll be working with people to find them jobs both within <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and even outside of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> also stressed that the company wanted to make the distinction between closing a plant and idling it. `` The difference is that we're going to leave the facility in a condition that it can be run'' if a new product is allocated to <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON>, a trustee of the local <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said most employees took the news calmly. `` If you've been with the auto industry any amount of time you believe something like this when it happens,'' he said. `` I know what they told us, -LRB- but -RRB- what could actually happen come July or August could be subject to change between now and then.'' `` The newer people naturally are more concerned, which they have a right to be. You tend to worry a little more,'' <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON> said. `` Most of your seniority people have been through this before, so they've more or less adjusted their lives around it.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar declined today against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as the market waited for an international monetary meeting, and stock prices rebounded moderately. The dollar opened at 130.15 yen, and ranged between 129.67 yen and 130.23 yen before closing at 129.75 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's close of 130.40 yen. Since last Thursday, the dollar had gained nearly three yen before today's decline. Exchange dealers said the dollar was expected to remain strong, but the market was cautious about trading ahead of a meeting scheduled in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday among the finance ministers and central bankers of seven major industrial countries.

<HEAD>Koreas Agree To Develop Resort, Shipyard, Rail Plant In North Korea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a joint venture unprecedented for the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, the south's <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate has signed agreements to develop a tourist resort, shipyard and railroad plant in the communist north. The agreement between the sometimes bitter rivals, reported by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s media on Wednesday, is considered a business deal with political connotations because it is still technically at war with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The countries have no official ties. South Korean tycoon <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju-yung </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'s honorary chairman, confirmed today after returning from a 10-day trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that he had agreed in principle with the north to undertake the projects along its east coast. He was the first <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> business leader known to have visited the north with the approval of both governments since <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was split in 1945. The Koreas went to war in the early 1950s and have long remained at odds. Under the agreement signed in the north's capital, <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government will jointly develop a resort around scenic <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kumgang </LOCATION> to attract <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> and foreigners, <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kumgang </LOCATION> area, known for its beauty, is about 20 miles from the demilitarized zone that divides the Koreas. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> told a brief airport news conference that the two sides also agreed to jointly develop resources in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and to jointly operate a railroad rolling stock plant and a shipyard, both at <LOCATION> Wonsan </LOCATION> in the north. He had already discussed the Siberian projects with Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The agreement, in the form of a protocol, was signed by <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Taesong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of the Promotion of Asian Trade. Because both are state agencies, the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government's approval of the projects was seen as guaranteed. While <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said the projects are subject to approval form both governments, one <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> official said the south would approve the undertakings as a sort of pilot project to stimulate inter-Korean cooperation. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has been seeking direct trade and other exchanges to ease tension between the two Koreas with an eventual goal of reunification. Both Koreas recently have made contacts to arrange high-level government and parliamentary talks to pave the way for peace. Some observers said the communist north, known for its reclusiveness, now appears ready for deals with the capitalist south to overcome its economic backwardness. Some see this venture as a way for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to attract scarce foreign currency. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said he and a 20-member survey team would visit <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in mid-April to discuss financing and other details for the resort project. He said he would be allowed to enter the north through the demilitarized zone _ a route previously permitted only for a few exchanges of official delegations for north-south talks in the 1970s and early 1980s. On his just completed trip, <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> traveled via <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials refused to allow direct travel across the north-south border. For visits to the new resort, he said, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is ready to allow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to cross the border near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kumgang </LOCATION> if they possess proper travel documents. It was not known how soon such visits could start. The planned projects in <LOCATION> Wonsan </LOCATION> would make rolling stock and ships mainly for export to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as well as repair ships, <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said. Wonsan is the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> port where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy ship Pueblo and its crew were taken after their capture by the north in early 1968. Sources said <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>'s visit to the north followed years of private contacts with the north abroad.

 The judge hearing <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial is questioning the motives of a television account of initial trial proceedings and says he may hold the reporter responsible in contempt of court. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said Wednesday that an account by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> `` appears to be a deliberate effort to obstruct'' jury selection in the trial. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s report, aired Tuesday night, included testimony in which <PERSON> North </PERSON> admitted lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at 1987 hearings. North gave the previously nationally televised testimony under a grant of limited immunity but it covers the same subjects on which <PERSON> North </PERSON> now faces 12 felony charges. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he had `` not made up my mind'' but was considering whether <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s account of Tuesday's proceeding provided an `` appropriate basis for a contempt action.'' Jury selection for the trial has been hampered by concerns about the finding jurors unfamiliar with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s previous testimony about the Iran-Contra affair. North's admissions to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not be used against him as evidence, and <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has ruled that no one who heard the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide's congressional testimony could sit on the jury. The judge excused three prospective jurors Wednesday because they had seen <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s congressional testimony. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> `` took pains'' to tell viewers that if they had watched the excerpts of the testimony included in the report they would not have to serve on the jury. <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: `` Correspondent <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> reported fairly and accurately what has been said in public regarding the North case.

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Flight Is Delayed To Replace Turbopumps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The launch of the space shuttle Discovery has been delayed and may be scrubbed because of cracks found in a high-speed turbopump of the spacecraft's counterpart, Atlantis. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers said Wednesday that the delay of the Discovery flight until at least mid-March could force a postponement in a scheduled April launch of Atlantis. But the Atlantis flight has priority and could force the cancellation of the Discovery launch, space agency officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement after shuttle managers reviewed an engineering analysis of cracks discovered in one of Atlantis' high-speed turbopumps after a December flight. Failure of the pumps could cause an explosion that could kill the crew. Officials said Discovery will be moved to the launch pad early Friday and three suspect pumps are to be replaced in conjunction with other launch preparations. Because of the uncertainty of the availability of new pumps and the length of time to make the replacements, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it would not set a firm launch date until a flight readiness review in late February. The agency had been aiming for a Feb. 23 liftoff for Discovery, but a series of technical delays not related to the pumps already had delayed that date several days. If the date slips past March 18, the planned April 28 launch of Atlantis will have to be delayed, officials said. Officials have said the Atlantis mission in April has priority because <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> will be carrying the <LOCATION> Venus-Magellan </LOCATION> probe, and will have only a 25-day `` window'' to launch it. Discovery is to carry a communications satellite. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials had said previously that its flight would be put off until later in the year if it could n't get off the ground by about March 15. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it could delay the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> flight a few days, although it would prefer not to do so. Officials would like to preserve the entire launch window in case of problems. Only one shuttle launch pad is currently available. A second is being refurbished. Questions were raised about the three turbopumps when engineers found two tiny cracks in a bearing unit in one of Atlantis' pumps after it completed the second post-Challenger mission in December. They believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion resulting from moisture trapped inside the bearing housing during the manufacturing process. But they are not certain how the moisture penetrated the metal. A search of records disclosed that two of Discovery's pump bearings had gone through the same manufacturing process as the cracked one, so shuttle managers decided at Wednesday's meeting to remove all three pumps and replace them with new, carefully inspected units. The turbopumps, which convert liquid oxygen into gas in the shuttle's three main engines, operate in flight at extremely high speeds, pressures and temperatures and a failure of one of them could set off a fatal engine explosion. The cracks on Atlantis were too small to cause trouble, but if such cracks widened and split the bearing unit, it could be dangerous, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals judge overturned a lower court decision and barred the release of a businessman who authorities said tried to export nerve gas and possessed classified documents. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> on Wednesday ordered <PERSON> Juhwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> held until a three-judge panel of the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reviewed the the $ 2 million bail set by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. The review may take place as early as next week, a prosecutor said. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Short </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, is jailed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for allegedly conspiring to export nerve gas, possibly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s release by Wednesday afternoon, ruling that a condition of virtual house arrest would be adequate to prevent him from fleeing. <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> stayed his ruling long enough for <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> to consider the matter. `` It's perfectly apparent to me it would be irresponsible not to grant a stay'' of <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s release, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> agreed with prosecutors who argued that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s release would be risky in light of the charges against him and the discovery in his office of documents on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence gathering capabilities. Moreover, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s international travels indicate he could easily flee She said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s wife and three children have spent most of 1988 in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> planned to travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and his native <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> The prosecutor also cited evidence of links between <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and `` high-level military and civilian'' officials in foreign countries. Because of the sensitive nature of the case, she said, several governments would prefer that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> not go on trial. `` He has contacts all over the world where he could find assistance,'' Ms. <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said. Defense attorney <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Littman </PERSON> contended the difficulty of communicating with his client in jail would hamper his ability to prepare for trial, tentatively set for May 1. He said the strict release conditions set by <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> _ including travel limited to his home, office and church _ were adequate. He also objected to the prosecutors' use of the newly discovered documents as more justification for keeping <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> in jail when that discovery has led to no charges. Though charges against <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> deal only with illegal weapons export, new evidence has begun surfacing suggesting <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s involvement in exporting sensitive information as well. In a letter Tuesday to <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> had classified documents revealing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' capability to intercept enemy communications. The government believes the documents could divulge information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic warfare capabilities and knowledge of `` enemy threat,'' a Joint Electronic Warfare Center official said in a memorandum to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A British national, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, also is charged in the case. The two are accused of plotting to buy the nerve gas sarin and other military equipment for export. Authorities have said the nerve gas was possibly headed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Suspend Attacks on U.S. Targets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas say the favorable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to their proposal to take part in elections has moved them to suspend attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> institutions and personnel. Wednesday's announcement reverses a rebel stand that held <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel or property as legitimate targets because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has given President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government about a million dollars a day economic and military aid. The insurgents last week offered to take part in presidential elections if the vote were postponed from March 19 to September and their security concerns were met. It was a major turnabout for the rebels, who had condemned all previous elections this decade as shams. The government has reacted negatively to the proposal, which it terms unconstitutional. Even so, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has said he is reserving final judgment. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the proposal `` was worthy of serious and substantive consideration'' and several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers have said it could be an important development in the search for an end to the 9-year-old civil war. On Oct. 27, guerrillas fired a rocket-propelled grenade at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The house of a high-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat was also the object of a grenade attack on Nov. 25. No one was injured in either attack. The insurgents issued a communique in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday announcing an immediate suspension of attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> targets. A guerrilla spokesman called <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> radio stations, which broadcast the communique locally. The statement says the suspension was motivated by `` the positive reception that our proposal has had in diverse sectors of North American society.'' It also cited `` hope of a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy'' with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The communique says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers based at <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> military installations are not covered by the suspension. In another development, the mayor of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s fifth largest city announced that he was resigning because of guerrilla threats. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliseo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Usulatan </LOCATION> joined about 80 other mayors who have resigned since mid-December, when the guerrillas began a campaign of threats against them. The country has 262 mayoral posts. Rebels killed nine mayors between March and November before adopting a policy of warnings. They consider the mayors instruments of the counterinsurgency plan of <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government, the army and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, in the election proposal, the rebels offered to respect the mayors `` if they sever their links with the army's plans.'' The guerrillas' Radio Venceremos on Wednesday said rebels killed or wounded 851 soldiers in January. It did not break down the figure. The armed forces press office said troops killed 120 guerrillas and wounded 115 during the month. Neither side gave its own casualties. Figures from both sides often appear to be inflated.

 The luck ran out this week at K.I. <ORGANIZATION> Sawyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, whose personnel had miraculously survived two aviation accidents in the past four months. `` It's a fairly sad place right now,'' <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychologist <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said Wednesday as the people at <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> grieved for 17 colleagues and relatives killed when a KC-135A air tanker crashed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The two other people aboard also were killed. Flags around the base, 10 miles from the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> shoreline in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, stood at half-staff, shivering in a bitter wind. `` That's eerie, to see that flag,'' said one airman. `` It's even worse to see the families -LRB- of victims -RRB- coming in.'' A military refueling plane from <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> crashed and exploded in a mesquite field Tuesday as it tried to take off from <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on a training flight to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Military officials said Wednesday that an investigation into the crash could take weeks, perhaps months, in part because the KC-135A Stratotanker was n't equipped with a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder. In addition to the seven-member crew, the aircraft carried at least three active-duty personnel and seven military retirees and their relatives. The identities of two victims were not released. For $ 10, military retirees and dependents of active-duty personnel are allowed to fly aboard training flights to destinations outside the 48 continental states on a `` space-available'' basis, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. Military personnel can fly free. When the plane left <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, it carried a crew of seven, plus 10 passengers. At <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, two more passengers boarded, including <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, a retired technical sergeant who was taking advantage of the military's `` space-available'' flight option for the first time since he retired in 1973, his wife said Wednesday. <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said her husband, a 23-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, was going to <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> to visit his son, who is in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and who married recently. `` He had time on his hands and decided he would take advantage of this flight,'' she said. At <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION>, 350 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, members of the close-knit base community reacted with silence and sadness Wednesday. Routine operations were carried on, but participation in a national prayer breakfast today was canceled. `` Our family is going through the process of mourning. We're caring for our people,'' the base wing commander, Col. <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Joersz </PERSON>, said in a terse meeting with reporters He walked out without answering questions. Memorial services at the base chapel are planned for Friday. <PERSON> Joersz </PERSON> said the base community would remain closed to the news media until after the service. About 1,900 families live at <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. The somber mood at the base contrasted with an atmosphere of relief at <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> following the Dec. 6 explosion of a B-52 bomber going through touch-and-go landings on the base's main runway. All eight crew members survived in what base personnel called a miracle. Just three months earlier, 10 <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> personnel had leaped out of an exploding KC-135 in a crash that killed six people at a sister <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> base. `` When you narrowly escape disaster, you feel like there was divine intervention, but underneath the dandruff is the notion, ` is it going to be there the next time?''' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> psychologist. With this third crash, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> personnel must cope with the feelings they had ignored, he said. `` Now the ultimate has happened. This will stimulate all sorts of reaction,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Statement: Group That Staged Argentine Assault Plans More</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A statement purportedly from the leftist group that raided an Argentine army base last month claimed troops killed guerrillas who had surrendered and promised to fight on `` until victory.'' `` What the soldiers did was take advantage of their superiority of arms to tread on our companions with tanks after they had fallen, to incinerate them with phosphorus after they had fallen, to shoot them after arresting them,'' said a half-page statement signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and published Wednesday in the Uruguayan newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION>. `` From now on, they -LRB- soldiers -RRB- are going to pay,'' it stated. `` We swear to continue the fight until victory.'' The newspaper said it was convinced the communique was authentic. It did not say how or where the statement was obtained. A long declaration signed by the front was found among the guerrillas who were killed or captured at the 3rd Infantry Regiment at <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tablada </ORGANIZATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> during a 27-hour battle Jan. 23-24. Twenty-eight guerrillas and 10 soldiers and police were killed, and 63 troops were injured. Fourteen commandos were captured. Spokesmen for <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s ministries of defense and interior declined to comment on the statement and said there probably would not be an official response. The communique repeated parts of the declaration that said the group acted to prevent an imminent right-wing coup and crackdown on leftist activists. No evidence was offered to back the claims. It said 46 front members with grenade launchers and ground-to-ground missiles staged the raid. The statement said more attacks are planned. The front, recently formed and little known, is thought to be small, but Argentine officials do not discount the possibility of another armed attack by it or a related group. `` The motivation of our companions ... is the increasing misery of the people,'' the statement said. `` In a country with 50 million head of livestock, every day children die of hunger. ... Retired people do n't earn enough to eat. `` A future of peace for our country will only be possible if measures are taken that assure a life of dignity for the people, justice realized and criminals punished.'' The Argentine government said the front is composed of leftist subversives from the Everyone for the <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and former members of the disbanded <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which openly fought in the 1970s against <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s then-military government. However, members of the Everyone for the Country Movement denounced the incident and deny involvement, saying members such as lawyer <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Banos </PERSON> who participated did so on their own. The communique did not mention the man Argentine officials say organized and possibly led the assault, former <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorriaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlo </PERSON>, for whom an arrest warrant was issued last week President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> formed a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to assess the risk of leftist subversion and canceled a planned trip to attend today's inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Attorney General <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alessio </PERSON> said last week that further assaults can not be discounted. Security precautions for the 14 guerrillas under arrest are tight.

<HEAD>Riot Erupts After Drug Arrest; Suspect Dies In Custody</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gunshots, rocks and bottles rained down on more than 100 police officers as they put down a riot triggered by the arrest of a black drug suspect who later died in custody, authorities said. Wednesday night's three-hour disturbance was the third riot in the predominantly black College Hill section in two years and the second in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in two weeks. A 22-square-block area of the neighborhood was cordoned off after the violence began as undercover officers struggled to arrest the 6-foot-3, 300-pound suspected cocaine buyer. `` The man fought us and punched one of our detectives three times in the nose,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. At least four officers received minor injuries, including the detective involved in the arrest, who suffered a broken nose, police said. No other injuries were reported. Police did not say if any arrests were made, and no damage estimates were available. A crowd, estimated at 150 at its peak, began to toss rocks and bottles at the officers. Before the violence was quelled, a grocery store was looted and set ablaze and a television news van was damaged by two shotgun blasts, police said. The drug suspect, whose name was not released, collapsed in a police cruiser and died at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Neither hospital nor police officials would discuss the nature of his injuries, but police spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said no shots were fired. The suspect was carrying a derringer, a small pistol, in his back pocket, said <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bexley </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Bexley </PERSON>'s Bar-B-Q in the neighborhood, said youths looted a grocery store before it was set on fire. `` Once they broke it, it took 10 to 15 minutes and they cleared it out,'' he said. `` Some went in, then things come flying out windows and doors.'' The fire also forced choir members at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Deliverance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to toss an organ and other valuables into a truck as a precaution. A youth with a shotgun fired on a <ORGANIZATION> WFLA-TV </ORGANIZATION> van, said cameraman <PERSON> Rugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` I knew he was empty after the second shot,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who was not injured. `` I almost went back to get him. That's what made me mad. I guess the little guy was having a ball.'' Mayor <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> showed up at the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> neighborhood wearing a formal gown. `` People who are out there and causing this are hoodlums,'' said the mayor, who had been attending an awards dinner. The unrest apparently spilled over to a <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> housing project, where youths attacked firefighters called to extinguish fires in two trash bins. In October 1987, rock - and bottle-throwing broke out in <LOCATION> College </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> after a black teen-age girl was hit by a vehicle that ran off the road and the driver fled Eight people were hurt and 11 arrested. Violence also flared in February 1987 after a 23-year-old black man died while in police custody. A white police officer who had used a neck hold to subdue him eventually was cleared of wrongdoing and the neck hold was banned. Last month, blacks in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> rioted for several days after a police officer fatally shot a black motorcyclist who was being sought for speeding.

<HEAD>Three Members of Teamsters Board Resign, Endorse Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three Teamsters executives settled civil racketeering charges by agreeing to endorse reforms sought by the government to curb alleged mob influence on the nation's largest union, officials said. The three also resigned as international vice presidents and members of the union's executive board but said the resignations were not in exchange for dismissal of the case. The settlement, however, does not affect the 14 remaining defendants in the lawsuit to oust reputed Mafia-dominated members of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' executive board, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastro </PERSON>. `` The case goes to trial at the end of February,'' <PERSON> Mastro </PERSON> said. In exchange for the union reform endorsement, <PERSON> Mastro </PERSON> agreed to drop <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Schurr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> as defendants in the lawsuit, filed last June under the civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations -LRB- RICO -RRB- Act. The suit claimed mobsters dominated the union's executive board and thus deprived the rank and file of their rights through a `` campaign of fear, bribes, extortion and theft.'' <PERSON> Mastro </PERSON> declined comment on whether the three would testify at the trial, although he noted the agreements for <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> stated there were no plans to call them as witnesses. In addition, the agreement called for the government to drop all claims against the pension and benefits they might receive from the union. <PERSON> Mastro </PERSON> also declined to confirm or deny whether settlement talks were under way with the union. Telephone calls for comment to the office of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoeller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, were not returned Wednesday night. Published reports indicated that Teamsters leaders had rejected a government proposal to settle the lawsuit, brought by then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, in exchange for the resignation of 16 international vice presidents named as defendants. As part of the agreement, signed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, who will preside over the nonjury trial, the three former board members will permanently resign all of their union posts and `` endorse the objective of preventing <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION> corruption of any elements of'' the union. The settlement endorsed also called on <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> to appoint an individual or committee not affiliated with the union to oversee Teamsters elections and guard against corruption. None of the three officials admitted any wrongdoing in signing the agreement. They did endorse changes in the union's constitution for the direct election of top executives by the 1.6 million members and other reforms. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> DuMouchel </PERSON>, said the government's action was a `` complete vindication for <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>,'' who announced his resignation Sunday, after more than 50 years with the union. `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> was not asked to resign and never offered to resign as part of any settlement discussion in this case,'' <PERSON> DuMouchel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schurr </PERSON> announced in October he was resigning effective the following month. That announcement came as then-new Teamsters President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> tried to oust <PERSON> Schurr </PERSON>, who had opposed <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in the election, as did <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>.

 Two helicopters crashed during training flights at the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base, killing one soldier and injuring three others, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. Investigators were trying to determine today if the two choppers, each with two soldiers on board, collided before they went down 150 yards apart Wednesday night, said Capt. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, an Army spokesman.

A loss by <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON> in the next game would bring the match to an end, said chessmaster <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. He said that for <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON> to keep the match alive, he would have to score 1.5 points in the next two games. A win is worth one point, and a draw gives both players a half point. As in the first game, <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON>, who played white, used a <PERSON> Ruy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> opening but then chose a more energetic game plan than in that game. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> defended with the Flohr-Zaitsev variation.

The deal with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was announced in the afternoon. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s contract at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was not yet up, but it included a `` window'' that allowed her to leave if <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> could not offer her an anchor position. `` <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was an important contributor to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> for more than a decade. We thank <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> for her fine work and tireless efforts with us and wish her the very best in the future,'' CBS News President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said in a statement released by the network. <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in 1978. In 1981, she became co-host, with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuralt </PERSON>, of the `` CBS Morning News.'' She joined `` 60 Minutes'' in 1984.

<HEAD>20 Members Of Communist Party's Central Committee Resign Or Ousted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A meeting called by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to stress unity ended after three days with the resignation or ouster of 20 senior officials, including a former party president. Those who resigned late Wednesday from the 165-member policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> included <PERSON> Vidoje </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarkovic </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s party chief from 1985-1986, and three of the largely formal state presidency's nine members: <PERSON> Lasar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sinan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasani </PERSON>. The ouster of <PERSON> Zarkovic </PERSON>, a Montenegrin, had been demanded since street demonstrations in <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> last month that led to the replacement of that republic's entire ruling elite. Ousted from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after a secret vote were <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Svetislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolasevic </PERSON>, the ethnically troubled province's senior Communist official. Critics held the two responsible for not preventing intercommunal strife in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, where the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority is allegedly persecuting minority Slavs and forcing them to leave the province. The three-day session ended without compromise on any of the political or economic issues convulsing this country. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, who survived attempts by Communists from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> to oust him as national party leader, issued a plea for unity. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> in his closing speech said unity was needed `` to enable the communist party to stop losing battle after battle.'' He added that <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s `` political stability is jeopardized.'' The country of 23 million people is a loose federation of six republics and two autonomous provinces that is plagued by ethnic rivalries and economic mismanagement. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>'s appeal came as officials announced the rate of inflation for January in this nonaligned <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> nation was 14 percent, bad news for a country ravaged by a record 250 percent inflation rate in 1988. Over the three days, more than 85 speakers delivered impassioned speeches but offered no solutions to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s deep economic and political crisis. In a related development, the party announced it would hold its 15th congress by Dec. 31, a year ahead of schedule.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The best-selling hardcover book in the nation last year was `` Cardinal of the Kremlin,'' a spy novel by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Clancy </PERSON>, a newspaper survey shows. The book, about the race by a member of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to rescue an American mole in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, was published in July and has 1,277,611 copies in print, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions Leading the nonfiction hardcover list was `` A Brief History of Time,'' by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawking </PERSON>, in which the author reviews efforts to create a unified theory of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Published in April, it has 825,000 copies in print. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Turow </PERSON>'s big-city murder tale, `` Presumed Innocent,'' was 1988's best-selling paperback novel, the Times said. The top-selling nonfiction paperback was `` Love, Medicine & amp; Miracles'' by <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, about the importance of the patient's mind and emotions in the treatment of serious illness. The leader in the hardcover advice and miscellaneous category was `` The 8-Week Cholesterol Cure'' by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> _ which has been on the Times' best-seller list for 82 weeks. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Watterson </PERSON>, creator of the <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> and Hobbes cartoon characters, dominated the paperback advice and miscellaneous category, with three of his books occupying the top five slots.

The survey was based on computer-processed sales figures from 3,000 bookstores and from representative wholesalers with more than 28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and supermarkets. The figures are statistically adjusted to represent sales in all such outlets across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Governor Calls For Clemency Hearing For Farmworker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has ordered prosecutors in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to investigate new claims that a farmworker was framed in the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven children. `` Justice ought to prevail, whatever it may be,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Wednesday as he ordered <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to continue a 3-month-old probe begun by the governor's legal office. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> also called for a clemency hearing for the farmworker, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 53, who is serving a life sentence at the <ORGANIZATION> Tomoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Such a hearing requires approval from three of six independently elected Cabinet members. `` There were seven deaths. We ca n't forget that,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Seven little ones died and someone was found guilty. If there was a wrongdoing at that time, we would like to know about it.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he was handing the investigation of the case over to Ms. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> because the probe by his office revealed conflicting information about the killings and because she has subpoena power. The governor's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> have been investigating the matter since October. In December, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s lawyers petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for another trial based on new evidence. A Feb. 9 hearing has been scheduled on that request by lawyers <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>. They claim prosecutors framed <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and that a neighbor who frequently baby-sat the children was the killer. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said Wednesday's action would not change the course of his petition. `` I do praise the governor for having enough integrity to look at this case and say something is wrong,'' he said. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and his wife were picking fruit on Oct. 25, 1967, when their children, aged 2 to 8, ate a parathion-laced lunch of beans, rice and grits. The lunch had been prepared ahead of time, but was served by neighbor <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> at the family's <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> home. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> killed all seven children, but he was convicted of only one first-degree murder count in May 1968 for the death of his 8-year-old stepdaughter, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> today ended eight days of harassing a Japanese whaling fleet off <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, leaving whale-shaped gingerbread cookies to the crews with a note, `` If you want to eat whales, eat these.'' The environmental group said its ship, the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION>, was steaming toward a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base on <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, which it claims is heavily polluted. `` We have finally finished our project here,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, interviewed by radio telephone aboard the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION>. `` We spent 90 minutes flying over the factory ship and three catcher boats, lowering the packages as a parting gift.'' <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> said the note attached to the cookies dropped by helicopter read: `` We bear no animosity to the Japanese people or members of the Japanese ships.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> informed the Japanese skipper of Kyo Maru No. 1, the factory ship, that the environmental organization filmed and photographed the harpooning and electrocution of minke whales during the past week. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _ despite a moratorium imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi restaurants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> helicopter dropped a box of cookies for each crew member with an attached note saying: `` If you want to eat whales, eat these.'' He said one of the Japanese catcher boats then relayed a message thanking the group for the package. Japanese whaling officials in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> have accused <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> of engaging in terrorist tactics and endangering lives. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said its presence temporarily halted the hunt and drew international attention to the plight of whales. The group estimated the Japanese had harpooned 55 minke whales. In <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> supporters in blood-spattered overalls today delivered bags of imitation whale meat to the Japanese Embassy and cultural center to protest the whale kill.

<TEXT>
 A Japanese soap opera is so much the rage in fundamentalist <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that sacrilegious praise of its heroine during a live radio call-in program led to the brief imprisonment of four <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> executives. An unidentified female caller had contended the series' persevering protagonist is a better role model for Iranian women than the daughter of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, the founder of Islam Those remarks in this predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem land of 50 million people triggered an outcry similar to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>'s remark during a 1960s news conference that the Beatles were `` more popular than <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> angrily demanded the radio executives be punished for offending Islam and his wish was heeded. Theology aside, the television show `` Oshin,'' which depicts a girl's travails in devastated postwar <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, is wildly popular among Iranians as they recover from their eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Traffic stops and blackouts are postponed during broadcasts of the serial, whose heroine, <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON>, suffers every imaginable hardship and setback. The four executives were sentenced to prison terms by a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> court Tuesday for broadcasting the phone-in program. Broadcast Director <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazar-Yazdi </PERSON> got five years and each of the three others _ <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abulqasemi </PERSON>, director of Islamic ideology; <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khunmeri </PERSON>, head of supervision; and <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasekh </PERSON>, editor of ideological programs _ received a four-year sentence and 50 lashes. But the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> today quoted the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Jomhuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islami </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> agreed to pardon the broadcasters on Wednesday after receiving an appeal on their behalf from Chief Justice <PERSON> Abdolkarim </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardebili </PERSON>. The news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had stressed in a letter to the state-run radio's director that `` if proven there was a deliberate insult'' the caller should `` receive the death sentence.'' The revolutionary patriarch's fierce reaction to the call underlined the religious passions that flow through <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But those passions have not kept the soap opera from captivating Iranian television viewers. The drama, whose broadcasts began last year in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, was chosen by officials who thought <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON> an exemplary role model for Iranians suffering hardships that included Iraqi rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and the loss of, by some estimates, a million of their countrymen. It became an instant hit. Week after week, <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON>, struggles on despite food shortages and cruel relatives, loses her house in a fire, and faces trial after trial. After <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON>'s father died in one episode, an Iranian newspaper published a full-page obituary. Letters of condolence and telegrams poured in from all over the country. When the heroine could n't find enough rice to feed herself, sympathizers sent the TV station some of their own precious rice rationing coupons for her. An Iranian schoolboy who recently traveled to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> brought with him a prized possession: a pocket-sized poster of <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON>, which he said he bought outside his school for about $ 2.50. <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON> has become a popular brand name for everything from shoes to electrical appliances. According to travelers from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, it's also a favorite name for new-born baby girls Daily power outages, which last up to six hours in the larger cities, are never scheduled for Saturday nights, when <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON> is broadcast. Just before the hour-long episodes, TV announcers ask viewers to switch off all unnecessary electric lights and appliances so the power supply will not be overloaded while the show is running. One <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> woman who experienced an unexpected blackout on Saturday recently while <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON> was showing, called a taxi to take her to another part of the city where the power was still on so she could see the show. The driver raced her to a cafe, where both sat down to see the program over a cup of tea. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s hectic traffic grinds to a halt while <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON> is on TV. `` If you want to hail a taxi while <PERSON> Oshin </PERSON> is on you're out of luck,'' one traveler from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said. Thus, on Saturday, birthday of the prophet's daughter <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahra </PERSON>, when the woman who telephoned in to the daily `` Family'' radio program was asked whether <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahra </PERSON> was a fitting model for Iranian women, her answer was an emphatic ` No.' `` <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahra </PERSON> is not acceptable because she lived 1,400 years ago,'' she said. `` I prefer Oshin.''

A letter was mailed recently to more than 200 businesses on the stationery of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pistol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. It was signed by <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Griisser </PERSON>, a leader of the 1988 campaign against a law that bans cheap handguns. `` We're going to give the people a chance to explain themselves before we declare a boycott,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurray </PERSON>, membership chairman of the gun group. `` We are going to declare a boycott against those who do n't respond.'' The association already has withdrawn its funds from <ORGANIZATION> Signet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in retaliation for a contribution the bank made to gun control backers, he said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general, said he learned of the letter Wednesday from a printing company that received a copy. `` It's deeply offensive and it's just not the way our system operates,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said. `` What's so troubling is the election is over. The voters made their decision, and now there appears to be an effort of economic retaliation to those who participated.'' <PERSON> McMurray </PERSON> said 225 to 250 businesses that made contributions to the Citizens Against Saturday Night Specials were sent letters. The letters say an explanation of why businesses supported the law would be helpful for consumers to `` make a more informed decision when selecting products and services.'' They also note that the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pistol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` represents the interests of the more than 650,000 <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> voters who thought this -LRB- the handgun control law -RRB- a bad and dangerous law.'' Last November's ballot measure to repeal the law lost by a 58 percent to 42 percent.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> expelled four Lebanese today from the Israeli buffer zone and killed three Palestinian guerrillas in an ambush, police said. A police spokesman identified one deportee as <PERSON> Yahya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, an educator attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The names of the other three men _ all Shibaa natives like <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> _ were not immediately available.

Most were expelled after allegations that they refused to cooperate with Israeli-sponsored local administrations in their villages or defied orders to join <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> ally, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said militiamen of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> drove <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> and his three companions from Shibaa to the edge of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone In Tyre, militiamen of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> ambushed during the night a guerrilla unit near the village of <LOCATION> Srobbine </LOCATION>, five miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, and killed its three members, a security source said. No casualties were reported among the Christian force, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear if the guerrillas were headed for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or planned an attack within the security zone. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> created the zone, which runs up to 10 miles into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, when it withdrew most of its occupation army from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the summer of 1985, ending a three-year invasion. The strip is designed to serve as a buffer against guerrilla attacks into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but the infiltrations have continued.

 Demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans clashed with police outside a meeting of right-wing extremists, and authorities said today that six people were injured. The demonstrators, many of them young leftists, protested outside Wednesday night's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which shocked mainsteam politicians with a strong showing in weekend voting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Police said about 1,000 protesters jammed into <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, and later started throwing rocks and bottles in this historic northern Bavarian city. `` Nazis out! Nazis out!'' they chanted outside the restaurant where about 400 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members were meeting. The demonstrators also clashed with police, leaving four policemen, one demonstrator and a news photographer injured, police said in a statement. There was no word on the conditions of those injured.

<HEAD>More Than 1 Millions Greek Workers Mount General Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 1 million workers closed banks, stores and most government offices in a nationwide general strike today to pressure the socialist government into granting wage increases. About 20,000 factory workers, teachers and white-collar employees marched through downtown <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> shouting `` No to austerity, yes to substantial pay increases.'' The demonstrators tied up traffic as they marched through the city center, but police reported no serious disturbances. Local labor centers in 30 cities and towns throughout the country organized similar demonstrations. Hospital were accepting only emergency cases during the 24-hour strike, which included workers in the private sector, officials said. The strike also paralyzed public transportation nationwide and closed down offices of the state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said the state-run carrier's ground staff and technicians also walked off the job, causing cancellation of today's domestic and international flights The walkout came a day after educators nationwide locked students out of classrooms to demand more government spending on education. The teachers plan to continue the stike through Friday. In addition to across-the-board wage increased linked to inflation, today's strikers want a three-hour reduction in the 40-hour work week, five weeks of annual leave and an immediate curb on price increases. Greek workers, who have a monthly average take-home income of $ 467, now have four weeks of annual vacation. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> imposed nearly a complete freeze on wages in October 1985 to combat annual inflation that had risen above 24 percent. Inflation now runs at about 14 percent. However, real incomes dropped by an estimated 12 percent during the two-year austerity program, which ended December 1987.

 Anthropologist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, who resigned as director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> nearly two weeks ago, was back at work today, but he refused to explain why he had changed his mind. The scientist declined to discuss the circumstances that led him to return Wednesday as director and chief executive of the museum. His secretary told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> was back in his office today, but `` says he does n't want to talk to the press.'' <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, 45, son of the late anthropologist <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, had headed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> for 20 years when he resigned Jan. 20. At that time, <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> had appointed a new board of trustees for the museum without consultations, and that he was helping carry out the ministry's `` reorganization. The museum houses <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best collection of fossils and human artifacts. The ministry on Jan. 27 issued a statement reinstating the disbanded board, on which <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> had served as secretary. The ministry did not mention its earlier action. <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> on Sunday told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he was waiting for the old board to reconvene and formally offer him his job back. `` Until then I'll stay in my shamba -LRB- farm -RRB-,'' he said. Last month, a <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> newspaper, The Standard, quoted unidentified museum employees as blaming <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> for an exodus of African scientists from the institution, which has a staff of 300. Museum employees later signed a public letter defending their director. <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> citizen, is a high school dropout who learned anthropology at the knees of his parents, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, pioneers in the discipline. In 1972, at age 27, <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> found a skull of a man-like creature while leading an expedition near <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turkana </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. The skull was later established to be 2.5 million or more years old, pushing mankind's family back at least a million years. The skull is known simply as 1470, its catalogue number in the Kenyan museum. Until <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s 1972 discovery, the oldest precusor of man was thought to date 1.5 million years.

 A moderate earthquake centered in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> shook a wide area of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, startling residents but apparently causing no damage or injuries, authorities said. The temblor, which struck at 8:51 p.m. Wednesday, measured 3.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, which measures earthquake activity. The quake was centered five miles southwest of Point Dume. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nosker </PERSON>, a waitress at <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>'s Restaurant on the nearby <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pier </LOCATION>, said the front of the restaurant trembled when the quake hit. `` All the windows were rattling and everybody stopped talking,'' she said. The quake was followed by up to a dozen small aftershocks, <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said. The location of the quake is 15 miles west of the epicenter of a 5.0-magnitude quake that struck eight miles off the <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> coast Jan. 18. But <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said Wednesday's shaker was not an aftershock of that one. The Jan. 18 quake, which was followed by more than 150 aftershocks, injured three people, shattered windows and knocked out power to 100,000 people. Wednesday's quake was felt across a wide area of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> counties. `` We've had a couple of calls of windows shaking -LRB- but -RRB- no damage,'' said sheriff's Deputy <PERSON> Venita </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>. `` As one guy put it, his cat did n't even look up.'' The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded on a seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.

 The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed today that progress is being made in resolving the <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> conflict, which has hampered Sino-Soviet efforts to end a generation of strained relations. The Soviet, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, also concurred with the Chinese position that international supervision will be needed to ensure peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ends its 10-year occupation of the Southeast Asian country. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s nearly three-hour meeting with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> focused on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and did not touch on the main purpose of <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit _ setting a date for the first Sino-Soviet summit since 1959 The meeting between Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Chinese senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, expected this spring, is likely to be discussed when the foreign ministers meet again Friday. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is the first Soviet foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> came in 1959 with <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Krushchev </PERSON>. Today's official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was a welcome change from the `` unyielding position'' of the stone-faced <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s `` grasp of foreign affairs is by no means second to his predecessor,'' the report said. `` He has a great amount of authority and quickly understands the essence of a problem.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> as saying the process of settling the Cambodian question is `` speeding up.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> agreed, saying: `` The situation concerning the Kampuchean -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- question has been developing.'' <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said the three Chinese-backed resistance factions and the Vietnam-backed government should be allowed to solve the question of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s future free from outside interference. Asked by reporters if <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has ceased to be an obstacle to better Sino-Soviet relations, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said: `` Both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> maintain that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should pull out all its troops from <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> as early as possible. The two sides hold that the Kampuchean question should be given a fair and reasonable solution and for this purpose the two countries have been making much effort.'' Differences reportedly remain on the structure of a transitional government and the nature of the `` international supervision'' to be introduced after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised to withdraw its troops by September. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s financial support for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is the most serious of `` three obstacles'' to normalizing political relations strained for the past three decades. The other two were the Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> _ which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says will end this month _ and Soviet troop strength on the Sino-Soviet border. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last month pledged to reduce Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, many of whom are along the Chinese border, by 200,000. Progress on those obstacles paved the way for Qian in December to make the first trip by a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 32 years. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said the `` question of relaxing the situation along the Sino-Soviet border'' was also discussed at the meeting in the Great Hall of the People. The two sides fought a short border war in 1969. Sino-Soviet relations soured in the late 1950s as <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> split over ideological and strategic differences, and <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> ended all Soviet technical and military aid to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1960. Economic and cultural relations have slowly improved in the 1980s, but party and government ties will not be formally normalized until the summit takes place. Also today, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> toured the Great Wall, about 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He will meet Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> on Friday and fly to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for a Saturday meeting with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>.

 An Afghan guerrilla leader predicted today that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s government will collapse soon after Soviet troops are gone and that guerrilla forces will not have to launch major attacks on key cities. `` The regime will fall in weeks, not months,'' <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, headquarters of the seven Afghan guerrilla groups. `` The whole world will be witness to the fact that <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will fall without any major onslaught on the city,'' he said. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said arrangements had been made to secure the fall of major cities without large-scale attacks, but he gave no details. Also today, a senior guerrilla military commander, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, said that while <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government could not survive long, there were indications the regime was making efforts to defend itself. <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, who commands guerrilla forces of the <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON> group around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said 5,000 special troops recently returned from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after receiving training in street fighting to defend cities against rebel attacks. The government was also building up special units to form defenses against the guerrillas after the withdrawal of Soviet forces, he said. <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said the Afghan army, formed largely of recruits forced into the service, has shown signs of collapse and was of little use in major operations. The government forces are increasingly confined to large towns and cities while the guerrillas control the surrounding countryside, he said. Under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. It intervened in the country in December 1979 to back the government in its war with Moslem guerrillas.

Philippine Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said he was leaving for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> today for a meeting requested by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, because doctors had advised <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` that he has n't much time left to live.'' `` He's basically very, very weak and depending completely on the respirator to regulate his breathing,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kop </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` He had been doing better, so this is a definite turn for the worse.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazo </PERSON>, a friend who visited the couple Wednesday, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> `` looks the worst I've ever seen him.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> underwent an emergency tracheotomy early Wednesday because of fluids building up in his lungs, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. During the 40-minute operation, a tube was inserted into <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' throat to make it easier for him to breathe and to clear his lungs He was hooked to a respirator and had a slight fever, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 59, fainted while accompanying her husband as he was being wheeled to surgery, and fell and hit her head, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` She was exhausted, she's gone several days without sleep, and then knowing what they were doing to the president, she just passed out,'' said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON>, adding that he expected Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to be hospitalized for one or two days. No one caught Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as she fell face forward onto the floor because everyone was walking behind her as <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was being wheeled to surgery, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. `` I was so shocked,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. `` All of this is just starting to get to her. ... I hope it's nothing serious. The doctors said she needs a lot of rest.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' head injury was not serious, but she was admitted into the room that had been used by her husband, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. She was in satisfactory condition today. An aide who answered the phone in her hospital room said Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was resting comfortably but unable to take calls. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 15 for treatment of pneumonia and bronchial asthma. In December, he was hospitalized twice for treatment of congestive heart failure. A federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is to decide this month whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering charges accusing him of plundering his homeland and stashing much of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $ 5 million bail. The Marcoses have lived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since fleeing the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> during a civilian-military uprising that brought <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power in February 1986. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> today, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she believed that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' condition `` is neither critical nor serious. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON>'s announcement that he was traveling to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> followed rumors in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> that he and Filipino industrialist <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> were trying to work out a deal to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to his native land. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said he had informed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and Executive Secretary <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> of his trip and would immediately relay message to the president. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> was acting on his own and not as an emissary of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>.

 Authorities have apologized to a man who was arrested more than a dozen times on warrants meant for someone else, but they denied charges that the arrests were racially motivated. `` There have been people of all races arrested on warrants that were issued for another person with the same name,'' said Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. `` We would hope that the person insist he is not the right one and that the officers would listen to him. It would appear that the ball was dropped in this case,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. At a news conference Tuesday, <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he was arrested 14 times over the past 10 years on warrants issued for a <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Both are 39. <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> remains at large, <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. After learning of the mistaken arrests, Sheriff <PERSON> Doyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> issued a memorandum in October alerting deputies and booking officers of the `` existence of two <ORGANIZATION> Sylvester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> with the similar descriptions and dates of birth.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was given a copy of the memo to carry. But the wrongly arrested <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said only one arresting officer gave him the opportunity to explain that he was n't the man named in the warrants. `` There are real racial overtones. I do n't think that a white person would have been treated the same way,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bledsoe </PERSON>, president of the local <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. Lt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Napier </PERSON>, of the police internal affairs division, said his office was investigating the warrants to see when they were issued and why they were never cleared. The police department also plans to issue a memo to all officers informing them of the mistaken arrests, <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> said. `` I can understand Mr. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s position,'' <PERSON> Napier </PERSON> said. `` If it happens once, that's going to upset you, but if it happens repeatedly, you're going to lose your patience. Nobody likes to admit that they're wrong, that they've made a mistake. But that's what happened.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plane carrying tons of equipment and a team of clean-up experts headed to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> today to fight an oil spill that some scientists say could pose a major environmental threat. The huge C-5 plane was bound for the southern city of <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arenas </LOCATION>, where its cargo and the 15-member team will be transferred to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research vessel, the Polar <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> said. In the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists were trying to catch floating oil barrels and propane containers near the spill, which was four miles in diameter and moving to the southwest, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the Argentine supply vessel that released the oil after it ran aground and sank was carrying 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel. It said an `` incurable disaster'' would result if all the fuel leaks into the region's unspoiled waters. In <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, an Argentine navy spokesman said the spill would not pose a serious ecological threat. A spokesman for the Chilean navy agreed. `` The information that we have is that there is no big spill,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barros </PERSON> in a telephone interview today. The Bahia Paraiso -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Paradise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ran aground on Saturday in the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, 600 miles south of the southern tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and 1 -LCB- miles from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The ship was carrying supplies for <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> outposts and sightseers. All 250 passengers and crew were rescued, but the ship floated free in heavy seas and sank Tuesday, dropping barrels of oil and several hundred propane gas containers into the water, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Another foundation spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON>, said most of the oil was in steel drums so the ecological threat may not be great. However, `` There's a bunch of free -LRB- drifting -RRB- oil down there,'' he said. `` The slick has arrived at Palmer Station,'' a scientific outpost run by the foundation. <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON> said personnel at the station had collected some steel barrels of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas near the ship. `` The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200 barrels -LRB- still -RRB- in the water,'' <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON> said in a telephone interview today from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. `` And there's still oil coming out of the ship.'' He said the ship is about `` 80 to 90 percent underwater'' but appears to have settled firmly on a shoal. `` The water surrounding the ship is covered with a couple of centimeters -LRB- about an inch -RRB- of oil. There is a sheen of oil in a much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil on the coastline of the several islands there,'' <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said. `` Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill, the small crustaceans that form the basis of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> food chain, <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said. `` Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior differences,'' he said. `` One dead penguin had been found as of a few hours ago.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> transport left <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday and was to arrive in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> today. <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said its crew and 52 tons of cargo would reach the accident site by Monday. The cargo includes a 35-foot `` skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat; inflatable booms to contain the spill, and a special truck for loading and unloading the equipment, said <PERSON> Renerie </PERSON>. He said it was accompanied by a crew from two private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> clean-up companies, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> is organizing the clean-up mission with assistance from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Artillery fire echoed through the capital today as President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> sought to assure reporters his government will survive once Soviet soldiers are gone and his troops alone face Moslem guerrillas. A Moslem guerrilla leader in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> predicted the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government will collapse as soon as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has left. Also today, Western journalists saw a convoy of more than 100 Soviet trucks and tanks starting out along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, the only road from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the Soviet border. `` State power is in full control of the situation, despite the difficulties,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told a news conference in an unheated room at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Reporters were not allowed to leave the building during the conference for security reasons, and explosions and artillery fire could be heard. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said his Soviet-backed government can not be excluded from any future coalition with Moslem insurgents, who have refused any power-sharing arrangement and are not party to the U.N.-mediated accord under which the Soviets promised to withdraw all their troops by Feb. 15. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said all Soviet forces would be out `` in the next few days.'' He would not elaborate. Afghan troops are `` capable of independently defending the people and the homeland and can give a resolute and mental rebuff to the opposition,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> asserted. Fears have increased in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because of uncertainty about the army's ability to defend the capital against the insurgents, who at several points have shut off the flow of food and fuel. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, guerrilla leader <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> told reporters today <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime `` will fall in weeks, not months.'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, said major cities, including <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, will fall without the guerrillas having to launch large-scale attacks. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> expressed optimism that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> might be able to help in a political settlement to the conflict in a planned visit Saturday to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a key supporter of the guerrillas with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president insisted his <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> will have to be part of any solution: `` Any attempt to exclude the <ORGANIZATION> PDPA </ORGANIZATION> and its allies in a coalition government will be in vain.'' The Soviets intervened in December 1979 to help fight an insurgency that began a year earlier when Marxists seized power in a bloody coup. The Soviet force numbered about 115,000 before the pullout began. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has assured the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government it will continue to provide military assistance after its last soldiers are gone. An estimated 1,000 flatbed trucks carrying rocket launchers, ammunition and small missiles move north along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> every day, Afghan officers stationed along the road have said. Guerrillas bombarded a Soviet convoy on Wednesday two miles past a checkpoint north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Soviets also use the highway to carry flour, eggs, kerosene and fuel to the capital, where food and fuel shortages have been reported in recent weeks, partly due to guerrilla attacks on convoys moving on the highway. The emergency shipments have helped ease the long lines that formed outside bread shacks. Most lines have disappeared or become noticeably shorter. It was unclear how long the Soviet tranport will continue to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, where refugees from the war have more than doubled the population to 2 million. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, officials today said an Afghan military transport plane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed about 20 miles inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, killing at least nine crew members. They said the plane went down Tuesday in a remote area of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frontier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, but would not say if the Afghans were trying to defect. Searchers recovered nine bodies, some clad in Afghan military uniforms, and the remnants of long-range rockets and other arms, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. They would not identify the type of aircraft. There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government or state media. Pakistan-based guerrillas said Wednesday that 400 government troops defected during weekend assaults in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second largest city The report could not be independently confirmed.

 As the crack problem grows ever larger, its victims have become ever younger. The latest two _ an 11-year-old alleged to be a drug courier and a 10-year-old crack dealer _ left officials wondering if they're losing the drug fight. `` Crack and drugs are so pervasive that of course it trickles down into the lower grades,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Berczeller </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. `` You have young kids used every day as drug runners.'' <PERSON> Ginay </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> school board activist for 17 years, agreed: `` I would say in terms of crack _ and we thought heroin was an epidemic _ nothing has spread with such rapidity among our school children.'' The two grade-schoolers arrested in separate incidents less than three weeks apart offered examples of both street and school incidents, authorities said. The 10-year-old was arrested Jan. 15 after police watched him and a 14-year-old partner make a half-dozen crack sales in <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The 5-foot-tall boy had three $ 20 vials of crack and $ 226 cash on him when arrested. A Family Court judge ruled Wednesday that he had committed the crimes and scheduled sentencing for Feb. 10. The boy faces up to 18 months' detention in a youth facility or two years' probation. Charges against the 14-year-old were pending. On Tuesday, an 11-year-old boy arrived at his <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> elementary school carrying what looked like his lunch bag. Inside, school officials found 411 vials of crack, most in 10-packs worth $ 50 apiece. The special education student told police his 17-year-old brother had given him the drugs. A search was on Wednesday for the brother, said police spokesman Officer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>. A Family Court hearing was held Wednesday for the 11-year-old, but there was no ruling. The city also filed a petition seeking to put the boy, his 13-year-old brother and 5-year-old sister in foster care. `` When an 11-year-old child with special learning needs is exploited as a drug carrier, it reaffirms my belief that drugs are the most serious problem our youth must confront,'' said Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> A. Warden, whose <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> district includes the school that the 11-year-old attended, said he was `` shocked and angry'' after the arrest. `` We do n't expect that from an 11-year-old youngster. It's like carrying a loaded machine gun in a playground,'' said Warden. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Terte </PERSON>, saying much of the problem is on the streets around the schools, noted that the number of drug arrests on school property was down in the past year. In 1987, the figure was 114; for 1988, it was 94. `` Remember, you're talking about 180 school days, with nearly 1,000 schools and 940,000 kids,'' said <PERSON> Terte </PERSON>. `` In percentage terms, that's a very small number.'' But <PERSON> Berczeller </PERSON> said the increasing drug problem was at least partially responsible for the increase in violence against teachers in the city. For the period Sept. 1-Dec. 1, 1988, 188 teachers were assaulted; for the same period in 1987, the figure was 119 teachers _ a 58 percent jump, he said To try to stem the drug tide, the city runs a drug education program that runs from kindergarten through 12th grade, said <PERSON> Georgeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> DelCanto </PERSON>, acting assistant director of health, physical education and substance abuse for the city schools. Each city school district is also assigned five to 15 drug counselors, and a special anti-crack curriculum was started two years ago, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, who is also on Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s advisory council on substance abuse, said she believed certain programs in her district were helping students avoid drugs But the two arrests _ particularly the one of a special education student in his school _ have other officials wondering if the tide is turning into a tidal wave. `` Are we losing the battle? I think we're in the middle of the battle. But the schools are not immune from the ills of society,'' said <PERSON> Berczeller </PERSON>. `` If you have kids running drugs on the street, you'll find kids running drugs in the schools.''

 A blast of cold air out of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> brought snowstorms and plunging temperatures to the West and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, triggering hundreds of traffic accidents and closing schools, and threatened to end the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'s record warm spell today `` Today was it. It will get seasonal,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Scura </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where a balmy reading of 69 degrees was one of 51 high-temperature records broken or tied in the East and South on Wednesday. At least two people died in weather-related traffic accidents in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Authorities in <LOCATION> Coleraine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, blamed minus 20-degree temperatures for the hypothermia death of a 31-year-old woman whose frozen body was found on a sidewalk. Snow continued falling today from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to the northern Rockies, northern Plains, and upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and was expected to spread to the Great Lakes. Freezing drizzle slickened roads from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. The foul weather was accompanied by equally foul temperatures in many places. In the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> declared a state of emergency, winds up to 40 mph produced wind chills as low as minus 90 degrees Wednesday. Low-temperature records for the date were set this morning in <LOCATION> Casper </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, where it was 23 below zero; <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, 33 below; and <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, whose 28-below reading beat the old record by 8 degrees. The storms caused traffic accidents in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and knocked out power to thousands of people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Snow closed schools in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and dangerously low temperatures shut them in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> today and in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> through Friday. Farther east, some schools in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> were closed because of freezing rain that made travel hazardous. Pupils at <ORGANIZATION> Richholt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, were `` running down the halls and shouting, ` Sinner for president! Sinner for president!''' Principal <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Buresh </PERSON> said Wednesday after Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinner </PERSON> ordered schools shut. Officials said it was the first time in memory that schools were closed statewide in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> because of cold. Near <LOCATION> Truckee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> 75 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, a tour bus overturned on icy, wind-swept Interstate 80, sending 23 people to the hospital, authorities said. Six were admitted. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, icy roads caused a 100-car string of accidents on Interstate 5 just north of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>. More than 200 accidents were reported in the Puget Sound area. Winds gusted over 100 mph, knocking out power to up to 15,000 customers in the <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> area, and 1,500 others in the western part of the state. Snow caved in the roof of <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>'s soccer center, doing $ 250,000 damage. Snowy runways caused delays at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, ferries were kept at their docks in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, pipes froze and auto parts stores reported runs on antifreeze and tire chains. `` I've already run out of several sizes -LRB- of chains -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, assistant manager of the <ORGANIZATION> McCall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Les </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schwab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, Ore. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, rain cut power to 4,000 people in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and hundreds more in communities as far north as <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION> about 40 miles away. Snow followed the rain in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which ended up with 11.9 inches of snow in 24 hours, a record for a 24-hour period in February. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, up to 10 inches of snow and gusting winds prompted a ban on some snowmobile travel and all backcountry travel at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. As much as a foot of snow was expected today. In western <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, the plunge in temperatures from the 20s Tuesday to below zero Wednesday resulted in a 20 percent increase in business at the Sapp Bros.-Sidney truck stop, said Manager <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Machamer </PERSON>. `` Hot chocolate, hot coffee, doughnuts and hot dogs, anything that's hot'' sold big, <PERSON> Machamer </PERSON> said.

 A 12-year-old boy accused of sexually assaulting a woman in her townhouse has been ordered held on $ 1 million bond. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crew </PERSON> said he set the high bond Wednesday for the boy because of other cases pending against the youth.

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who is recovering from a stroke he suffered two weeks ago, resigned today as the leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but said he will stay on as the nation's president. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, told party officials in a letter that he was resigning the party post to concentrate on his presidential duties and to distance the presidency from partisan politics, state radio reported. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s parliamentary caucus chose National Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as party leader. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> declined to discuss his political agenda. He appears to favor <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s policies of limited and gradual reform of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system of racial separation. The party parliamentary caucus chose <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> by a vote of 69-61 over Finance Minister <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON>, who is considered slightly more moderate, said the state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Other contenders _ including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and the acting president, <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Develpoment </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> _ were eliminated in early rounds of balloting, according to state radio <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> became party leader in 1978 when he was elected prime minister. He became president in 1984 under a new constitution that abolished the post of prime minister. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s president is selected by the political party that controls <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which opens this year's session Friday in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to discuss his possible retirement but has said during the past year he would consider reducing his work load. A bill has been introduced to revive the post of prime minister to share leadership duties with the president. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is recovering from his stroke at his private residence in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and takes daily walks in his garden, his doctors say. The stroke weakened <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s left arm and left leg, and he will need at least one more month of rest before he can consider returning to work, the doctors said today. As education minister, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, 52, has not been associated with any major reforms. He supported a controversial crackdown on anti-apartheid dissent at universities and has tried to halt defections from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said today that if he wanted to propose any policy changes as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, `` I would like first to have a discussion with the state president.'' `` A very special relationship will now have to develop between myself as leader-in-chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on the one hand and the state president as chief executive on the other hand,'' he said at the news conference. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> declined to answer directly when asked if his selection as party leader made him the logical successor to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. He noted that his position had `` no direct or formal constitutional implications.'' The independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said, however, that <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s selection as party leader `` is a firm indicator that, should President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> resign, he would succeed him.'' The president is chosen after national elections are held. There was widespread speculation <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would call for an election in April, but his stroke makes such a ballot unlikely until later this year, observers say. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which codified apartheid legislation after coming to power in 1948, has ruled uninterrupted since then and is expected to maintain power in the next election. Other contenders to succeed <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as president include <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>. All appear to favor <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s policies of gradual race reform, although <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is considered slightly more liberal than the others.

 A court today extended the detention of a Soviet-born Israeli suspected of spying for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

A court spokesman reported the decision to extend the man's detention by 10 days, but the court in <ORGANIZATION> Petah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, barred publication of the suspect's name Israeli radio stations gave detailed coverage of the case and quoted the man as saying he was disillusioned with Israeli society. `` I ask that you take in consideration that all my life I only wanted to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and here I suffered. There were people who embittered my life every day and each hour,'' radio reports quoted the 35-year-old immigrant as telling the court. `` I was a better citizen than those who embittered my life, and I did not understand the severity of what I did,'' he was quoted as saying. He did not cite examples of his problems. The case is the second of alleged spying by a Soviet emigre in the last two months.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has informed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he may authorize the sale of 315 front-line <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tanks to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and 200 to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> while providing a third Arab country, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, with 40 F-18 fighter jets, informed sources said today. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, meanwhile, would get 150 Hawk missiles and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> 200 shoulder-fired Stingers, while <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> again would receive no <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons this year, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The potential Arab purchases could touch off another row with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who were successful during the Carter and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administrations in blocking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales that were considered threating to the Jewish state. But the skilfull management of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, then the White House chief of staff and now secretary of state, and other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration operatives overcame stubborn resistance to the sale of Awacs radar planes to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved 52-48. The <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank is considered the best in the world. Recently, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Egyptian officials completed arrangements for co-production in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> with the aim of providing the Egyptian army with them.

 <PERSON> Punxsutawney </PERSON> <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>, that plump, pampered groundhog long touted as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best mammalian meteorological prognosticator, saw his shadow today, predicting six more weeks of a `` kinder and gentler'' winter. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>'s promoters, declaring today the 102nd Groundhog Day, rousted the brown, bewhiskered forecaster out of his lighted, heated burrow at dawn. `` In honor of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the groundhog stood tall and proud. He spotted a thin, short shadow,'' <ORGANIZATION> Punxsutawney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groundhog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON> told spectators gathered at Gobbler's Knob, a wooded knoll about three miles south of <LOCATION> Punxsutawney </LOCATION>. `` The king of all groundhogs is returning to his burrow with a promise of a kinder and gentler winter,'' Means said. Tradition has it if the weather-wise woodchuck sees his shadow, six more weeks of winter will follow. But if he does n't, they say spring is just around the corner. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>'s unscientific forecasts do n't always hold up, but his handlers nevertheless claim he's never wrong. `` We say he's always right,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Null </PERSON>, secretary of the groundhog club and executive director of the local <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are some people who contest that, usually weathermen, but we stand behind <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> 100 percent.'' Groundhog Day fun has given rise to four-legged forecasters elsewhere, and most of them today broke with <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> and predicted an early spring despite the arctic blast that's been working its way across the country in the past couple of days. But none draws the attention that <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> does. `` <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>'s been at it longer than any of the others,'' Null said. `` He's treated like a real king.'' Some folks in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, made up `` Quahog Day'' and cast a man dressed as a quahog, a type of clam, to come out of his shell today. The quahog did not see his shadow, so <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is theoretically assured of a short winter. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s also off the hook, winter-wise, as a groundhog dubbed General <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> failed to see a shadow today in <LOCATION> Lilburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Concord <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Freddy both failed to see their shadows this morning, as did <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chuck </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Rowdy </PERSON>, a groundhog at the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>. And it was likewise in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> the Groundhog braved wind-chills of 16 below to predict an early But it is this western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> mountain town of about 8,000 people that bills itself as the `` Weather Capital of the World,'' crowns a Groundhog Queen and King, stages a Groundhog Ball, and attracts tour-bus visitors who often buy souvenirs glorifying the exalted woodchuck. Every year, hundreds of people follow a century-old tradition and trudge up to <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>'s one-morning-a-year home atop Gobbler's Knob. Fourteen businessmen of the club's exclusive `` Inner Circle'' don top hats and tuxedos to carry on the tradition. Actually, Inner Circle members decide on the groundhog's prediction beforehand. Several hours before sunrise, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> is taken from his year-round home in a glass-enclosed case next to the town library and shoved into the man-made burrow to await spectators. The woodchuck, whose species usually hibernates until March, is then hoisted at dawn to the glare of television floodlights and popping flashbulbs. Perhaps cleverly, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> has predicted an early spring only nine times _ in 1890, 1902, 1934, 1950, 1970, 1975, 1983, 1986 and 1988, according to Null. Groundhog Day legend is based on an old Scottish couplet claiming, `` If Candlemas Day is bright and clear, there will be two winters in the year.'' Feb. 2 is the Christian holiday of Candlemas. In the late 1800s, the feast appealed to Punxsutawney's German-born farmers, who hunted woodchucks for food For the record, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-day outlook calls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in the Southeast, below normal temperatures and precipitation over the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, near normal temperatures and precipitation in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, and near normal temperatures and above normal temperatures over the nation's central area.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> lost a preliminary round in his impeachment trial today when a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel called for televised hearings before a special committee rather than before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` There will be no question about the fairness of it,'' Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., said after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he chairs called for a special panel of six <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and six <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators to hear evidence Under a two-step procedure recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would first rule upon motions by <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and his attorneys for dismissal of charges that the 52-year-old <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> jurist plotted to get a $ 150,000 payoff. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could act within 30 days. The special committee appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders then would hear perhaps six weeks of evidence in the case, with television cameras on hand and proceedings being taped for viewing at leisure by other senators. The Rules Committee approved the blueprint on a 9-0 vote. It would not be the the first judicial impeachment trial on television. Hearings in the case of impeached <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> were carried two years ago. The Rules Committee left in up to the special panel whether the current one also would be broadcast nationwide or merely to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> offices. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was not on hand for the committee meeting, had asked for evidence hearings before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Short of that, he had sought to have the evidence hearings taped, saying that senators should see the demeanor of the witnesses. `` The video will give us an opportunity to accommodate Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in his request that we watch the demeanor of the witnesses,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> told the Rules Committee. He told reporters afterward, however, that lawmakers would watch only `` if they want to.'' <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was acquitted in 1983 of charges that he plotted with a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney to obtain $ 150,000 in return for assuring that two convicted racketeers would not serve time. Other judges, however, brought the evidence to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which on Aug. 8 voted 413-3 to approve a bill of impeachment. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> maintains he is innocent and says the allegations represent an attempt to oust him for political reasons. The bill of impeachment says <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> plotted to get the payoff, made false statements at his trial and, in an unrelated matter, disclosed secret wiretap information, wrecking a federal investigation in the process. Empaneling a special committee to hear the evidence is not new. The procedure was used for the first time in the 1986 impeachment trial of <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON>, who sought in vain to hang onto his robes even though he was already in prison for tax evasion. The idea of a special committee goes back to the 1930s, when lawmakers themselves said they were appalled by a `` dreary, protracted and involved'' impeachment trial on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor in which evidence was sometimes presented to a chamber that was all but empty. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> told reporters on Jan. 26, however, that the issue was far too important to be shunted into a committee. `` This is not an agriculture bill,'' he said. `` This is my office that is at stake here.''

 A 310-pound man was arrested and charged in the death of his 14-month-old son, who police say was smothered while his father slept in the same bed with him. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strause </PERSON>, 23, was arraigned Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Reading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges of criminal homicide, involuntary manslaughter, unlawful restraint, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person, and endangering the welfare of a child. <PERSON> Strause </PERSON>, who was held in lieu of $ 500,000 bail, was brought to the arraignment from a substance abuse treatment center where he had spent the past 28 days, officials said. Documents filed by Criminal Investigator <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manzolillo </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strause </PERSON> admitted to police he had smoked cocaine for three days before going to sleep for 12 hours on Dec. 23. <PERSON> Strause </PERSON> told investigators he awoke to find his son, <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON>, lying face down and immobile. He removed <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> to a kitchen table and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but could not revive the child, police said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today approved the nomination as housing secretary of former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who has agreed to give up more than $ 55,000 in speaking fees after being told he apparently violated limits on outside income for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s nomination by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to become secretary of housing and urban development was approved unanimously by the committee and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for confirmation. The committee also unanimously approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> to be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> filed financial disclosure forms last week with the committee and the federal Office of Government Ethics reporting honoraria amounting to $ 67,350 above what House rules allow. The Associated Press learned Wednesday that the staff director of the Democratic-controlled committee, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, confronted <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> personally last week with the apparent violation. The former congressman from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, agreed to return $ 16,000 in speaking fees and to forgo another $ 39,400 in fees not yet received. He also deferred receipt of an additional $ 12,500 in fees earned in 1988 until 1989 to avoid violating the limits on honoraria congressmen can receive in any one year. The actions brought <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> $ 550 below his 1988 limit. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>, described the problems as `` just a misunderstanding.'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said today that no objections were raised by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee members because <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> moved quickly to correct the problems and cooperated fully. <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said the former congressman mistakenly believed that money received after leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was not covered by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits, even though it was for appearances made while a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> filed an amended financial report with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> Ethics on Monday to reflect the changes. The changes were made without public disclosure by either <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> or the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s aide and the committee acknowledged the changes in response to questions from the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, which identified the problem in a review of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s financial statements. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was subject to the House rules limiting all outside income, including honoraria, to 30 percent of his $ 89,500 congressional salary _ or $ 26,850. In addition, a less restrictive federal statute limits honoraria to 40 percent of congressional salary, or $ 35,800. In his original filing, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> reported receiving $ 119,000 in honoraria for 1988. He also reported giving $ 24,800 of the money to charity, which under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules is not counted against the limit. House rules also limit honoraria _ fees for speeches or similar appearances _ to no more than $ 2,000 per event. In his original filing, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> reported several well in excess of that $ 2,000 limit. He reported receiving $ 30,000 for two appearances on the television show `` Firing Line'' in September and October, and $ 10,000 each for speeches to <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, A.B. <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. He also reported receiving $ 5,000 from <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assoc </ORGANIZATION>., and $ 2,400 from <ORGANIZATION> Crosby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assoc </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told him he believed the limits did not apply because he was leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and would not receive the checks until after he was out of office. `` Well, clearly the limit does apply, and when it was pointed out to him that it does, he turned around and made the appropriate adjustment,'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> agreed to return $ 8,000 each to <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. He agreed to reduce his `` Firing Line'' fee, which had not yet been received, to $ 2,000 per appearance, or $ 4,000 total. He also agreed to reduce the fees for World Trade and <PERSON> Laffer </PERSON> to $ 2,000 each and to forgo altogether the Crosby fee, <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON> said. Because the remaining total still would have exceeded the overall House limit on honoraria, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> shifted fees totaling $ 12,500 to 1989 _ when he said he actually received or will receive them, according to both <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> and Brunette. That gave him a 1988 honoraria total of just over $ 26,000 and within the limit. <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said that after consulting with staff of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee he decided <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules permitted honoraria to be counted in the year actually received, even though earned in a different year. The manual for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members published by the ethics committee states that honoraria may be counted in the year in which they are received. But it also contains another sentence that raises questions about whether this is permitted if the object is to circumvent the limit. `` A member may therefore not earn income and have it deferred to another year or to when he leaves <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to avoid the income limitation,'' says the manual, titled `` Ethics manual for members, officers and employees of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>.'' Transferring the excess to 1989 solves <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s problem if he is judged to be subject to a limit that is 30 percent of a full year's income _ which is <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>'s interpretation of the rules House rules describe the limit as 30 percent of the aggregate salary received during the year, which might give him a limit of about $ 150, since he earned only about $ 500 as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for two days in 1989. Under this interpretation, the remainder would have to be donated to charity.

 The bomb that blew up <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> was planted by Palestinian terrorists in the luggage of a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent, a radio station said today. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, head of the news department at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forth </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, reported the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer was returning from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with five colleagues after a mission to negotiate release of the nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Investigators In <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, where the investigation into the Dec. 21 disaster is headquartered, refused comment on the report, which cited information from unidentified Scottish police sources. In December, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was among the jet's passengers. They did not give the agent's name. At that time, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s executive assistant director, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, denied the agent was on the jet. Radio Forth did not name the agent it said was on the jet. It said investigators believe a three-pound charge of Semtex explosive and a timing device were slipped into the agent's luggage by Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated the secret <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> mission. It speculated the perpetrators belonged to <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> has been accused in the past of involvement in the bombing and has denied it. On Wednesday night, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> was the principal architect of the bombing. It said <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, was working for <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> but was required to clear the operation with Syrian intelligence officials. Last month, the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s organization was involved in the bombing <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Shehabi </PERSON> as saying, `` I tell you that we did n't do it and we are not involved. We do n't practice terrorism and we condemn such actions.'' In <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, one of the stops on the flight, prosecutor's spokesman <PERSON> Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> said the report of Syrian and <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> involvement was `` just speculation.'' The Radio Forth report quoted sources as saying the bomb was placed in luggage that also carried `` quite sensitive documents.'' It said the baggage was shipped from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where the agents caught the flight for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The timer was believed to have been activated during the stop in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, the report said. All 259 people on board the jet were killed when it exploded in the sky over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Eleven people on the ground in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> also died. Investigators have concluded a bomb was to blame.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is unlikely to grant the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s request that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> help free two imprisoned former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> legislators while they appeal criminal convictions, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said today. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was extremely unlikely that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> would intervene to overturn a judge's ruling on a criminal conviction. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hand-delivered a letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> last week that pleaded for the release of former state Sens. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> while they appeal 2 -LCB- - year prison terms for trying to obstruct a congressional investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal `` The attorney general said that he would take a look at the situation,'' department spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, confirming a report published in today's editions of The Baltimore Sun that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had appealed to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> for help. The department sources noted that the trial judge's decision to deny the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> brothers bail pending appeal was upheld by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, who handles emergency appeals from federal courts in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. In the letter, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said freedom was `` imperative'' for the Mtchells, who are nephews of former Rep. <PERSON> Parren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, D-Md. The Mitchells are the sons of the late <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who was a nationally respected civil rights lawyer. `` I have agreed to assume a leadership role in the effort to bring national attention to ensure justice in this important case,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wrote in the letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. He said a federal judge's denial of the <ORGANIZATION> Mitchells </ORGANIZATION>' request for release was `` unprecedented.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s letter does not directly address racial issues. But after his meeting with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> last week, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained to reporters that several white defendants convicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, including former Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, remained free on bail while the <ORGANIZATION> Mitchells </ORGANIZATION>, who are black, were ordered to jail. The two are serving prison terms at the <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION> Federal Prison Camp in <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, for their November 1987 convictions on federal fraud and obstruction charges. During their trial, prosecutors presented evidence they collected $ 50,000 from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> defense contractor, to help block an investigation of the firm by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, then chaired by their uncle.

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was sworn in as president today before dozens of dignitaries, including Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, and promised to work for peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and a solution to the Latin American debt crisis. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 67, who won a second presidential term 10 years after his first term ended, took office amid a stand-off between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on the region's $ 440 billion foreign debt. He is <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s seventh president in 30 years of democracy and the first to be re-elected. In his first act as president, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> appointed his 22-member Cabinet, state governors and other key government officials. The president has left no doubts he will work ceaselessly for a Latin American common stand against creditors. He has given top priority to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s $ 33 billion foreign debt. It is a different <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> than the one Perez governed from 1974 to 1979, when the oil-producing nation was awash in oil revenues. In a speech Wednesday to the Latin American Economic System, a regional organization, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> called on Latin American nations to `` unite our fears and face together the presidents of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s prime minister'' in debt discussions. More than 20 chiefs of state and government attended the inauguration, including <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, whose country is the Third World's largest debtor. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> conferred with all of them in a series of marathon talks that concentrated on debt and the Central American situation. All the Central American presidents were in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> for the inauguration except <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napeoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, who has cancer. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s visit was part of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s announced intention of bringing <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> back into <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> diplomacy in hopes it will contribute to peace efforts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s last visit to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> was in 1959. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> on Wednesday on his first foreign policy mission, met with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> later that day. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> rejected the idea of a Latin debtors' cartel and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would oppose a move toward one. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> pressed for more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flexibility on the issue, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> promised to relay the request to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said a <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> also is expected to play a key role in efforts to develop a regional peace plan. Nicaraguan Contra leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday he sees <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> as the main leader for resolving the Nicaraguan conflict. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> supported the Sandinista overthrow of Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in 1979, but he now has joined other critics of the leftist regime's curtailment of individual freedoms.

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, moving to limit political damage from a proposed 50 percent congressional pay raise, said today the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would vote next week on cutting the increase to 30 percent. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would also vote on banning members from receiving speaking fees and other honoraria. Because House members currently can retain up to 30 percent of salary in honoraria, those receiving the maximum would receive no actual raise. `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will vote next week to ban all honorariums and to cut the pay raise to 30 percent instead of 50 percent. That'll make it just come out even,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters. A 30 percent raise would hike the current congressional salary by $ 26,850, to a total of $ 116,350. A Democratic leadership aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> planned for the vote to take place after the raise would become law next Wednesday. This would roll back the increase for lawmakers and executive branch officials, but not for judges, whose salary can not be reduced under the Constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> planned to vote today or Friday, and was virtually certain to turn down the 50 percent raise, which would boost most congressional salaries from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. who has met with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and plans further meetings, `` has not signed off on the 30 percent pay raise proposal nor the idea of a vote the following day,'' said <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said `` of course there's always a chance'' that his proposal would be defeated. But he said he was encouraged by answers given by 326 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members to a survey he conducted this week on the pay raise. Without announcing the results, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said: `` They indicate that the members feel that they should give up the honororia and they should substitute a straightforward, upfront way in which they would receive and all other people in the government would receive a decent raise, but not an exorbitant raise, and that they ought to vote to do it. I think it's upbeat.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has tried to convince his colleagues for weeks to reduce the raise to 30 percent but told reporters previously the members were privately telling him they wanted 50 percent without a vote. The raise becomes law unless both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vote to stop it. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> appeared to be going along with these private sentiments until he abruptly reversed course this week and ordered the survey. Aides said the speaker was tired of reading that he was stopping the will of a majority to vote on the raise. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> informal survey of nearly a third of the 435-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> showed about 88 percent of those responding wanted a vote on the larger package. Groups opposed to the increase said their own survey showed that slightly more than 60 percent would vote `` no.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators moved ahead Wednesday with separate but similar proposals to bar speaking fees and restrict other outside income should the raise become law. A bipartisan draft document, given to senators and obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, compared the latest <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposals on outside income. Both packages would ban honoraria, including fees for speeches, appearances and articles, upon enactment of the raise. Leaders in both houses have made clear that honoraria would continue if the pay raise is defeated because members do n't want to suffer a loss of income. House members currently can retain $ 26,850 and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members $ 35,800 in honoraria. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan includes a contingency that would permit retention of some honoraria if the raise is partially scaled back later. The plans under discussion in both houses would permit such fees to be donated to charity on a member's behalf. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would limit the donation to $ 2,000 per appearance and require members to list on financial disclosure forms the amount, the payer and the recipient of the donation. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not get full cooperation from his colleagues in his survey. House Republican Whip <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., told his hometown paper, the Casper Star-Tribune: `` I did n't return the form I do n't do polls. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> contacted 143 congressional offices and found 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the pay raise. Only six said they were against it and seven were undecided. There was no response from 38 offices. The survey released Wednesday by raise opponents, indicating 62 percent of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members opposed to the increase, was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer advocacy group founded by <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, and two conservative groups: the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and Coalitions for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The proposed honoraria plans would allow groups that invite members to an event to continue paying for travel. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would direct its ethics committee to issue rules and regulations defining acceptable limits. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> draft would prohibit members from receiving any pension benefits from honoraria given as a charitable donation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan would go further, prohibiting conversion of any of the donations to a member's personal use. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan would limit all outside earned income to 15 percent of a member's salary, half the current 30 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also would end a provision in federal law that has allowed 190 House members, in office before 1980, to accumulate $ 39 million in campaign funds that could be converted to personal use. The measure would become effective in January 1991, giving <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members one chance to retire with the money. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> already has a rule prohibiting such conversion.

<HEAD>Principal Charged in Paddle Beating of Special Ed Student</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An elementary school principal has been charged in the paddling of a special education student, and police are investigating whether school district officials were remiss in failing to report it. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 48, was charged Tuesday with injury to a child in the May 23, 1988, beating of a 13-year-old boy who was described as emotionally disturbed, police said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who did not answer telephone calls to his home this morning seeking comment, was suspended from his job Wednesday. Police said they knew nothing of the incident until state investigators contacted them six months later. `` The investigation is ongoing and will probably involve a grand jury,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Staney </PERSON>. The boy was hit about the arms, back and head in the principal's office, where he was called after being involved in a shoving match with another student, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said `` The boy was sitting in a chair and the principal told him to get down and bend over,'' <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. `` The boy started crying, saying he did not want to get hit.'' At one point, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> pinned the youth's head between his legs and struck him once on the head with the paddle, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. The boy's hand also was cut during the beating, which was witnessed by several people The principal noticed the bleeding hand, took the boy to the school nurse's office and bandaged the hand himself because no one was on duty there, police said. The parents told investigators their son also later underwent an X-ray to check for head injuries. One of those witnesses eventually became frustrated at school officials' lack of progress in an internal investigation and contacted the state attorney general's office, which contacted police because the district was uncooperative, <PERSON> Staney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Yawn </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said he is unaware of any failure to cooperate with authorities in the investigation.

 The judge in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial added two more people to a pool of prospective jurors today, while rejecting two others, including a woman who said she recalled seeing the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide on television when he gave immunized testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A woman who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for 21 years and a clerk typist at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were sent into the jury pool, which now has 18 people out of a group that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> wants to build to 50 by the end of the week. Prospective jurors have been instructed not to read, watch or listen to anything about the case. The former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee, now a secretary, said she `` did n't even turn the television'' on when she went home Wednesday night `` because if I had I would have had to tell a lie. I do n't want to go to jail.'' The woman said her main source of news was talking to other people and that her husband thought <PERSON> North </PERSON> was `` somehow messing up.'' She said she thought <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities involved `` something about weapons ... selling weapons to the overseas people.'' The clerk typist, a woman in her 20s, said she had heard `` teenie bits'' of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s 1987 congressional testimony in news broadcasts, but that `` I did not pay attention. I saw it and turned the channel.'' North attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said the woman should not be included as a juror because `` she saw <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony,'' but <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the woman heard it `` only enough time to turn it off.'' Rejected for the pool was a contracts supervisor at the government's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, who said she recalled that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had been involved in sending `` some guns to another country,'' although she could not remember the country. The <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> employee also said she recalled something about <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` lying to the committee. I just heard that vaguely.'' Five of the criminal counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON> charge that he obstructed and made false statements to congressional panels in 1985 and 1986 by denying he was assisting the Contra rebels fighting the leftist government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at a time when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras had been banned. The prospective juror said she was n't interested in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s 1987 testimony, but `` I saw him on TV.'' Also rejected for the pool was a man who said `` I do not know that much about'' the North case, but did n't think he could be a fair and impartial juror. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had said Wednesday he wants to start picking a jury Monday after rounding up a pool of 50 prospective panelists before the weekend. So far, 18 people have been identified who remained largely unexposed to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s nationally televised congressional testimony in 1987. In that testimony, the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide discussed many activities for which he now faces criminal charges. North was granted immunity from prosecution for that testimony. North's lawyers say any exposure whatsoever to that testimony would violate their client's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was required to gather information for the criminal charges independently of any congressionally immunized testimony. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> sent nine people into the pool of prospective jurors, saying `` I think it has gone very well so far.'' Seven prospective jurors were identified on Tuesday after the trial opened. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he hopes to pick a pool of 50 by Friday, have the prosecution and defense prepare for in-depth questioning and `` move for jury selection Monday.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has been calling into court for initial questioning only those people who say they did n't see, read or listen to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s congressional testimony in 1987 Even with those restrictions, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers objected to almost all the 16 who were sent into the jury pool, on the grounds that they had been exposed to news accounts of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s 1987 testimony. North faces 12 criminal charges. He is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of lying to the attorney general the about the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s role in diverting money from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Contras. He also is accused of illegally accepting a $ 13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> of tax revenue by using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the Contras.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> apparently offered a government job to a woman after she asked him why he was `` messin' around'' with her teen-age daughter, according to a videotape of the confrontation The 57-year-old divorced congressman also replied, `` I did n't really know she was a teen-ager,'' according to the videotape broadcast Wednesday night by WSYX-TV The case has been investigated by <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> police and turned over to the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it found no evidence that the congressman from <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> tried to bribe <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, who said her daughter was 13 years old when the girl met <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> four years ago. WSYX-TV said it secretly videotaped the Nov. 11 meeting between <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> and and Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> at a fast-food restaurant in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. At the meeting, according to the videotape, Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>: `` I'm a curious mother and I'm concerned, you know, about my daughter and her, you know, her welfare. ... `` I could n't understand a man in your position, you know, why you're messin' around with these teen-agers. ...'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> replied: `` Well, first of all, I did n't really know she was a teen-ager. I did n't know that, no. I do now, of course.'' At the end of the conversation, according to the videotape, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> seems to have offered to find Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> a government job. `` Let me go back -LRB- to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- and see what there is part-time and ... -LRB- inaudible -RRB-. ... I do n't know what, uh, the government has, but I can check and find out. And, uh, I'll give you a ring later today. It may be later today if I find out,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said. Calls by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' residence and office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and to his home in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were not answered Wednesday evening. He declined to comment on Tuesday after WBNS-TV broke the story. His <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office said today the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman had been advised by his lawyer not to comment on the case. The girl, who is now 17, said that in 1985, a friend brought her to <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' penthouse apartment in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, according to WSYX, which said she was able to accurately describe the inside of the apartment. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was a state Senator at the time. `` They took me in this room, and she said get undressed and put on this robe, and I told her that, you know, I was n't going to do nothing, because I was scared,'' she told the station. `` And then she said, ` He just want to see your body.' ... `` And then they started having sex, and then he told her to get up. And then he, like, pulled me on top of him and started having sex with me,'' WSYX quoted the girl as saying. She said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> later paid both girls and gave them a business card, the station reported. She also said that three years later she and a friend went back to the apartment, and that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> encouraged the girls to have sex with each other. The girl said she refused, but that she then had sex with <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> and again was given money, the station reported. `` I was so angry, and I wanted to cuss him out, and get in contact with some people to get this guy away from my daughter and other young people,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 and served two terms. He lost a bid for governor in the Republican primary in 1970. He was appointed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and was elected in 1976. In 1974, he fought allegations that he accepted $ 1,000 in campaign contributions from <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Tongsun </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> during his first stint on Capitol Hill. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, arriving for a whirlwind tour, charmed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fashion elite at a glittering reception and today chatted with formerly homeless women at a community center. Hundreds of residents of a housing project lined the streets as the princess' motorcade pulled up to the Henry Street Settlement, a 96-year-old community center that helps immigrants, homeless people and the elderly. Halfway through her visit to the settlement, the princess, wearing a black skirt and black-and-pink top, emerged from a building and strolled by crowds, waving and talking to some lucky residents. Inside, she spoke with seven women who were once homeless, but had acquired apartments with the help of the settlement on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s lower East Side. `` Her visit does matter,'' said <PERSON> Theather </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 33, a mother of four. `` She's royalty and she'll bring attention to the homeless. She'll help the people realize the problems of the homeless.'' The princess was met at the settlement by <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, wife of Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, then talked for nearly an hour with the once-homeless women. Residents of a housing project, the <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Houses </PERSON>, had cheered her arrival at the settlement. `` It's nice that she came. They cleaned up the place,'' said <PERSON> Efrain </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, a maintenance man who leaned out a window to get a glimpse. `` She should come more often. It was very dirty. It was the pits before.'' On Wednesday night, awed fashion designers and retailers proclaimed <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> radiant and divine when she appeared at a party in her honor. The 27-year-old princess, who had just arrived on her first official visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sounded equally impressed by her host city. `` It was marvelous, quite dramatic,'' she said when asked her first impressions of the city. Tonight she was to attend the American debut of the <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>, which will perform <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Falstaff'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>. As the Princess of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, she is patron of the opera company. <LOCATION> Irish-American </LOCATION> activists opposed to British involvement in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> planned to demonstrate outside the opera performance. But <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s first evening in the city was devoid of controversy. The princess arrived on a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> supersonic Concorde flight at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 5:49 p.m. Wednesday for her three-day visit. Her first public appearance was on the 50th floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, where she attended a gala reception and buffet dinner hosted by <ORGANIZATION> Dawson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, producers of Scottish cashmere. Before she arrived, guests received some last minute instructions from British Consul <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Finlayson </PERSON>. `` For British subjects it's protocol for the men to nod and the women can curtsy,'' he said `` For Americans, ever since the War of Independence, you can do what you want.'' Many of the guests opted to shake hands. The princess arrived wearing a gathered blue satin tunic over a black wool skirt with pearls at her neck. `` She looks divine!'' exclaimed <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s department store. `` She looks great in that color.'' Designer Oscar de la Renta went further. `` She has extraordinary looks and when you have extraordinary looks you can wear anything,'' he said. `` With time, she will be one of the great well-dressed ladies of the world.'' For <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, the gathering was bittersweet. His son, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, was among a group of <ORGANIZATION> Syracuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students who died in the December crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. When it came his turn to greet <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> pulled out a picture of his son and showed the princess. She was `` very sympathetic,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Joffe </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Dawson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, who observed the exchange. `` She said, ` I'm very sorry. He would not have felt anything.' She dealt with it extremely well.'' This week's tour is the first lone official visit abroad by <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> since October 1985, when she went to the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>'s base in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> The princess visited the White House during a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour in 1985 with her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, who remained in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> this week. He will arrive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Feb. 16 for a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S., South Korea Say Joint Maneuvers Will Go Ahead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Thursday they are still planning this year's joint military exercises with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> despite North Korean protests. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said the maneuvers have already begun. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has called for eliminating the exercises as a precondition for continuing a peace dialogue with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, but it made no mention Thursday of canceling upcoming talks. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> command in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> played down the exercises. It refused to confirm this year's maneuvers would be held but acknowledged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officers `` began planning on the training many months ago'' and that `` planning continues.'' South Korean Defense Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-hoon </PERSON> said on state television Wednesday that the `` Team Spirit'' exercises will be carried out as planned. He said, however, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials may consider adjusting the scale and format of future exercises if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> shows a `` concrete change of attitude'' toward <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate. The exercises have been conducted annually since 1976 to test the joint command of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and South Korean forces in the event of a North Korean invasion. The maneuvers usually begin in early February and end in mid-April. Announcement of past exercises were made well before the maneuvers began. This year, however, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to delay a formal announcement until later this month to help promote its dialogue with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` committed a never-to-be condoned crime'' in starting the exercises as the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> talks approach. It said preliminary talks for high-level political and military discussions were scheduled for Feb. 8, and legislators were to meet Feb. 10 to prepare for a large-scale parliamentary meeting. The agency said the exercise `` clearly proves once again that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists and their stooges do not want peace and peaceful reunification of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and have not yet awakened from an anachronistic dream to invade the North.''

The JAS 39 Gripen, designed by a Swedish consortium as a future mainstay of the country's air defense, has been hotly debated because of cost overruns and production delays. TT, the national news agency, said the plane overturned at the end of the runway. Reporters on the scene said it looked intact. The pilot was hospitalized with unspecified injuries. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Charlotta </PERSON> <PERSON> Bjorklund </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>, a leading member of the consortium, said she knew only that the plane had crashed. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nygren </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> TT </ORGANIZATION> the government would have to `` discuss possible consequences'' for the plane's future.

<HEAD>1988 New Home Sales Inch Up After Plunge in 1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New home sales edged up a meager 0.9 percent last year, the government said Thursday in a report analysts cited as evidence that higher mortgage interest rates continue to dampen activity in the housing market. Sales for all of 1988 totaled 677,000 dwellings, up from 671,000 sold during the previous year, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Home sales had plunged 10.5 percent in 1987, with the drop blamed on rising interest rates and a slowdown in demand after five strong sales years. Analysts said they expected continued increases in interest rates and a slowdown in the economy to result in a modest decrease in new home sales this year. `` The bottom's not falling out of the market by any means but we do expect a modest slowing,'' said economist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Fixed-rate mortgages last week stood at 10.6 percent, up from 10.16 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Many economists are predicting interest rates could hit 11.5 percent by the middle of this year. Last year's new home sales ended with a slight upturn, as sales for December rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 669,000 after dropping 7.9 percent during the previous month. All of December's strength came from the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where sales rose a surprising 52.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 104,000. Sales were down 22.1 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 2 percent in the South and 1.3 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. However, for the year overall, the Northeast was the only region to post a decline, with sales down 13.7 percent to 101,000. Sales were up 9.7 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, 1.1 percent in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and 1 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Analysts were puzzled by the December surge in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, saying it might be due to unusually mild weather and difficulties with seasonal adjustments during the winter months. `` The Northeast clearly is fundamentally a weakening part of the country, with the West probably still, on balance, a strengthening part of the country,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the slackening in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> was coming on the heels of several years in which a sales boom resulted in overbuilding and drove up prices. Figures for the West, meanwhile, have been dominated by strength in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the healthy economy and a fear of future restrictions on development are spurring sales. `` People are trying to buy now and get in now, and builders are doing the same thing, in hopes that they wo n't be curtailed by slow-growth or no-growth initiatives,'' <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> said. Nationwide, the median price of a new home rose 9.7 percent in December to $ 121,000, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price of a new home also was up, rising 11.1 percent to $ 152,200. <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON> said the December increase in prices was largely due to the shift of sales to the more expensive Northeast rather than a national trend toward a surging prices. For the year, the median price of a new home was $ 112,500, up 7.7 percent from a year earlier. The average price was $ 138,300, up 8.7 percent.

 With the wave of a sacred evergreen branch over an altar covered with vegetables, seaweed and dried squid, a <LOCATION> Shinto </LOCATION> priest prayed Thursday for the safety of the first high-technology <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 jumbo jet to enter commercial service. The white-robed priest competed with departure announcements inside an airport lounge overlooking the new plane at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as he chanted prayers for the jet _ the latest version of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 _ and for the prosperity of its owner, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the most technologically sophisticated commercial aircraft to enter the skies,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` It will set the pace for commercial air travel through the 1990s.'' The plane, received by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> last week, is the first 747-400 to be delivered by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the first of 10 ordered by the airline. It arrived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday on a test flight carrying five Northwest pilots and four officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Following the blessing by the priest, who was hired by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> executives offered sacred boughs at the altar and bowed and clapped twice, a standard prayer in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s animist Shinto religion Airlines have eagerly awaited the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 _ distinctive for its curved wingtips and extra-long upper deck _ because of its reduced fuel consumption and two-member flight crews, compared with the three-member crews needed on other 747s. But critics of the planes, including some pilots' unions, have questioned the safety of the smaller crews, which do without a flight engineer. `` I feel very confident that this plane will be as safe or safer than the earlier 747s,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Boston </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of flight standards for the 747-400 In the cockpit, multicolored video displays reminiscent of video games replace many of the usual gauges. Sophisticated computers monitor thousands of sensors throughout the airplane, and display the plane's route and location and keep track of radio signals from check points along the way. `` You might say we now have an electronic equivalent of a flight engineer on the plane,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebli </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of 747-400 maintenance. `` It's like something that you saw in ` Star Wars' _ it's a military concept that is being introduced in commercial planes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide delivery of the planes has been delayed for more than a month by bugs in the sophisticated computer software that resulted in false computer messages, but the problems have been solved, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> said. `` I am very confident in the airplane. I think they've done an excellent job,'' he said. Northwest plans to put the 747-400 into regular service in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after its FAA-required proving flights are completed, probably in the spring. Northwest's order of 10 planes, including spare parts, is valued at about $ 2 billion.

 A man who tried to ride a jet ski to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to plant a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag as a publicity stunt was rescued in a combined Navy-Coast Guard operation after nearly sinking 14 miles south of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, rescuers said. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderveer </PERSON> was picked off his foundering, one-person motorized vessel by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday then airlifted by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was treated for hypothermia, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyers </ORGANIZATION> said. The three-hour rescue effort cost about $ 12,000 in <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> fuel and equipment costs, Wyers said. <PERSON> Vanderveer </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, told his rescuers he had tried to go to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as a publicity stunt, Wyers said. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s north coast is about 90 miles south of <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Vanderveer </PERSON> had planned to jet ski across the <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and plant an American flag on the beaches of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and then come back to the Keys,'' Wyers said. A Greek merchant ship told the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> it was in radio contact with a distressed sailor describing his vessel as a `` disabled jet ski'' that was taking on water. Jet skis have handlebars and are considered by some to be the equivalent of a snowmobile for water. They are meant to be used in protected waters and are not sea-worthy vessels. <PERSON> Vanderveer </PERSON> left the hospital late Wednesday, a spokesman said. There is no telephone listing for him in the <LOCATION> Miami-Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION> area.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is questioning officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> about <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-designate <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s connection to a former <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> official convicted of extortion. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is inquiring about former <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON>, who was involved in a financial conflict-of-interest scandal at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> school, where <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is president. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> medical school, said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` talked to me about a range of issues about Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s fitness for the position -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary -RRB-, including that -LRB- Eaves -RRB- and many other things.'' He declined to say what other issues the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> questioned him about. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> wants <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> permission to maintain his connection with the medical school while he serves the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as secretary of health and human services, according to published reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times today quoted sources as saying <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> requested that he be permitted to take a sabbatical as president of the school, possibly with pay. Acting HHS Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> told a staff meeting Wednesday that administration officials initially approved the request, but later reversed themselves, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> sources understood the reversal ruled out a paid sabbatical while <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, but not necessarily an unpaid leave. White House counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that `` nothing has been approved. The -LRB- White House -RRB- lawyers are looking into his -LRB- <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s -RRB- requests regarding leave, retirement and sabbatical policy and will work something out that does n't violate government ethics.'' Sabbaticals are traditionally given in academic institutions over seven years to senior professors to conduct research at full pay. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> officials said that in the past, academic figures have frequently taken unpaid leaves from their institutions to work at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> for a period of time, but not sabbaticals. The White House earlier this week requested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> postpone <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing, saying that the financial disclosure statements and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check were not completed. White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON>' connection to <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> was the reason for the delay. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment. The school paid Eaves $ 675 a month for about four years as a guest lecturer while he promoted the school's positions on several issues before the commission. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said he did not know how often Eaves lectured at the school. Eaves was convicted last May on extortion charges. Aides to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and Labor and Human Resources committees, which will hold hearings on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s nomination, said they were unaware of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s connection to <LOCATION> Eaves </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that `` there is no greater peace than that which comes from prayer'' and later jokingly predicted that those who pray for him to land in hot water will have their prayers answered. The president, speaking to the National Prayer Breakfast, mixed serious talk about the value of prayer with jokes about critics and his pledge to encourage `` a kinder, gentler nation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he prays daily, and `` there is no greater peace than that which comes from prayer and no greater fellowship than to join in prayer with others.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had canceled a speech Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> because of laryngitis. He was hoarse this morning during his brief talk at the prayer breakfast. `` Should n't we also remember that for all we have to be grateful for, to pause each day to offer a prayer of thanksgiving,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the gathering of more than 4,000 people, including dozens of elected and appointed officials. `` All of us should not try to fulfill the responsibilities we now have without prayer and a strong faith in God.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then turned to humor, first recalling a story the Rev. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> had told him about milking a cow in his boyhood days in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, had been told it was a `` kind and gentle'' cow but he got whacked in the eye by the cow's tail and nearly kicked when he tried to milk it. `` It's one thing to request it, it's another thing to see it actually happen,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Maybe a lot of folks out there are thinking that if you folks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stop trying to milk us we'll stop kicking,'' the president said to laughter from the audience. On a more serious note, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` if we're to walk together toward a more caring and a more generous <LOCATION> Amercia </LOCATION>, let us all share in paving the way with prayer.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told a joke about a young boy whose grandmother was always complaining about being cold and the boy's prayer to `` make it hot for grandmother.'' `` I suppose there may be some people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and all over the country who have already begun to pray ` make it hot for <PERSON> George </PERSON>','' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Those prayers will be answered in time. Be patient.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a tough act to follow _ Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> told several jokes that brought roars from the gathering, including one about a boy whose mother, during a Mass, pointed out a memorial to `` the boys who died in the service.'' `` Which one, the 9 o'clock or the 11 o'clock?'' the boy asked. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> also brought down the house by saying, `` Those who travel the high road of humility in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are not troubled by heavy traffic.''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> today criticized former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> for holding discussions with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, saying `` it has a chance of complicating matters.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refuses to talk with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. `` Obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads of state we do n't meet with it has a chance of complicating matters,'' he told reporters following the inauguration of Venezuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, midway through a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, would not meet here with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. The Nicaraguan leader shared his proposal in a meeting Wednesday with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> declined to discuss details. <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had no plans to meet with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, although the two did speak briefly Wednesday night at a reception at the ambasssador's residence. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation are trying to learn more about a peace proposal that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> brought with him to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, but the vice president said nothing has been learned officially. Asked if he had talked to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since arriving here Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a cold and laryngitis. `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used to use that not to have press conferences, but it wo n't be in this administration,'' he said. The vice president sandwiched get-acquainted sessions with heads of state around the inaugural ceremony for Perez. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held bilateral meetings upstairs in the <ORGANIZATION> Caracas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> met briefly with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in the downstairs lobby. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met first with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s prime minister, <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, and then with <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>. The meeting with <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> centered almost entirely on the Latin debt crisis and the one with <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> on a range of U.S.-European political and security issues, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. Ambassador <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seems to be developing a good rapport and handling himself confidently in the meetings. He said the foreign leaders mostly want to ask questions about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policies on the Third World debt situation and Central American conflicts. `` They like him. There is very good rapport. They think he's very open, obviously very interested in listening,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has explained that the new administration's policies are still developing, the ambassador said. `` He's explaining ... that the administration is less than two weeks old.'' Beginning his three-day Latin American trip Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> warned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not look kindly on formation of a `` debtors' cartel'' to deal with the region's creditors, whose hold $ 440 billion in debts. He met with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, with outgoing <LOCATION> Venezuelan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> and with <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> today continued his effort to meet as many heads of state as possible while he was here for the Perez swearing-in. The schedule included meetings with the presidents of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and a lunch with <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> leaders. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Skol </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> specialist traveling with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, said the vice president was taking a cautious approach. `` He's not saying too much when he should n't say too much,'' especially on topics for which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy is still developing. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's first overseas diplomacy mission to find a atmosphere buzzing with talk of the region's financial crisis. During his meeting with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, aides said, the two agreed to disagree on the Third World debt issue, but concurred on the need to push for democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Venezuelan leader has been active in promoting the idea of a coordinated Latin effort to deal with the countries' debts. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposes any organization amounting to a cartel but is not ruling out other kinds of multilateral approaches, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters the new administration is ` absolutely opposed to the idea of a debtors' cartel.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> pressed for more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flexibility on the issue and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> promised to relay the request to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said an aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who previously served as <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s president in the 1970s, also is expected to play a key role in efforts to develop a regional peace plan. Contra leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> told reporters at a reception hosted for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> by Ambassador <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> that he sees <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> as the main leader for resolving the Nicaraguan conflict. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> supported the Sandinista overthrow of Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in 1979, but now has joined other critics of the leftist regime's curtailment of individual freedoms.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday that he prays daily for guidance and, trading solemnity for levity, told those who pray for him to land in hot water that their `` prayers will be answered.'' The president and first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended the annual National Prayer Breakfast a day after he canceled a scheduled appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> because of his laryngitis. Still hoarse, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mixed serious talk about the value of prayer with a handful of jokes, bemoaning that because of protocol his attempt at comedy came after remarks by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., who warmed up the crowd of more than 4,000 with a polished stand-up act <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, beginning on a serious note, said: `` There is no greater peace than that which comes from prayer and no greater fellowship than to join in prayer with others. ... All of us should not try to fulfill the responsibilities we now have without prayer and a strong faith in God.'' He then turned to humor, poking fun at his call for a `` kinder, gentler nation'' with a story the Rev. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> had told him about milking a cow in his boyhood days in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, had been told it was a `` kind and gentle'' cow but he got whacked in the eye by the cow's tail and nearly kicked when he tried to milk it. `` Maybe a lot of folks out there are thinking that if you folks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stop trying to milk us we'll stop kicking,'' the president said to laughter from the audience. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told a joke about a young boy whose grandmother kept closing the windows each time the boy opened them. Despite their running battle, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, the boy prayed God would `` make it hot for grandmother.'' `` I suppose there may be some people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and all over the country who have already begun to pray ` make it hot for <PERSON> George </PERSON>','' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Those prayers will be answered in time. Be patient.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> proved a tough act to follow. He gave a nostaligic version of a childhood he said included federal probation for blowing up mail boxes, rowdy college days during which `` I thought beer was food,'' and a father who when asked at the age of 91 if he had lived his entire life in <LOCATION> Cody </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, replied wryly: `` Not yet.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> drew roars from the crowd with a joke about a boy whose mother, during Mass, pointed out a church memorial to `` the boys who died in the service.'' `` Which one, the 9 o'clock or the 11 o'clock?'' the boy asked. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> also brought down the house with a one-liner aimed at the self-important in the nation's capital, saying, `` Those who travel the high road of humility in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are not troubled by heavy traffic.''

 State legislators say they are getting complaints from constituents who mistakenly think it is the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> lawmakers up for a 51 percent pay raise.

 Runaway railroad cars derailed and exploded early today, knocking out power to 37,000 people in and around <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> and forcing the evacuation of thousands in wind chills of 70 degrees below zero. There were no reports of serious injuries in the 4:48 a.m. explosion, which rocked houses up to three miles away, overturned automobiles and shattered windows in a nearby college and homes, officials said. The explosion occurred in an open area near three major power lines, and authorities believed at least one had been severed. Electricity was restored to all but half the city within 10 minutes. `` It's a miracle no one was killed or injured,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Schild </PERSON>, undersheriff for <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Firefighters fought a blaze near a railroad tanker containing hydrogen peroxide, which threatened to set off a second explosion, police Capt. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbis </PERSON> said. The fire flared up and spread to a boxcar containing plastic pipe, releasing hydrochloride gas, which <PERSON> Carbis </PERSON> described as `` very noxious.'' Authorities urged `` everybody in town to stay inside,'' <PERSON> Carbis </PERSON> said. Emergency workers were pulled back from the scene because of the gas and one paramedic was taken to a hospital after inhaling fumes, he said. Firefighters wore respirators. Snow fell as firefighters poured water on the flames. Temperatures of 29 degrees below zero combined with winds to produce wind chills of 70 below, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. About 2,000 people, including 700 to 800 of the 1,100 students at <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, were evacauted from a square-mile area around the blast zone, officials said. Evacuees went to churches, the <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armory and schools, which were already closed by the cold snap. The blast initially knocked out power to all of the state capital, which has about 27,000 people, and the surrounding <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, population 10,000. `` Our campus has suffered extensive damage,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, who is also head of development for <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. `` There are chunks of rail cars blown from 300 yards away all over campus.'' Virtually all the windows at the college were smashed and stone trim was knocked off the physical education building, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said. The explosion came after <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> freight cars broke loose near the Continental Divide while engines were being switched on <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern tracks, railroad officials said. The cars rolled nine miles east and downhill into <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, where they struck a locomotive and exploded, said Rail Link spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Toppins </PERSON>. `` I jumped out of the way from being squashed,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McNellis </PERSON>, who was aboard the locomotive struck by the runaway cars. About 20 cars derailed, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemm </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION>. One of the cars contained hydrogen peroxide, another held alcohol and the third was carrying an unknown liquid, according to the state Disaster and Emergency Services Division. Hydrogen peroxide is a corrosive and dangerous chemical, <PERSON> Toppins </PERSON> said. The explosion occurred in an open area directly north of the college and between the city dump and city golf course. `` If it was n't for that golf course and the -LRB- adjacent -RRB- baseball diamonds, we'd have a lot of tragedies,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>. `` That really saved our bacon.'' About 300 <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students and nearby residents milled about the main floor of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armory, about half a mile across an empty field from the college. Students generally joked and laughed or dozed in groups, but older people were somber. `` It's funny to see what some people brought with'em,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobdell </PERSON>, editor of the campus newspaper. `` There was a lot of makeup. One girl had her fishtank. And lots of people _ <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> people, not students _ brought their dogs. No cats, just dogs.'' The only injury reported at the college was a girl who suffered a minor cut on her arm, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, vice president for academic affairs.

 The escalating prices of fuel, motorcycles, and bicycles have created a run on donkeys in a northern state, increasing their cost by 500 percent, a news report said Thursday. The military government ordered a 43 percent increase in fuel prices in January, the second big increase in a year. Inflation has put motorcycles and bicycles out of the range of many Nigerians, prompting some to turn to donkeys. <PERSON> Malam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sani-Maijaki </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Katsina </LOCATION> state town of <LOCATION> Jibia </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> that demand for his donkeys had increased sharply because of the higher fuel costs. As a result, the price for a medium-sized donkey has risen to about $ 30, he said. <PERSON> Sani-Maijaki </PERSON> also said some Nigerians had developed a taste for donkey and horse meat during the country's hard times, also driving up prices. The economy of this West African oil-exporting nation has been in a deep recession because of low oil prices and economic mismanagement.

 Searchers today found a 16-year-old youth who had been stranded in his car for 2 -LCB- days on a snow-blocked road with only a light jacket, sweatshirt and car mats for warmth in below-zero temperatures. <LOCATION> Towner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderberg </PERSON> identified the boy as <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> of rural <PERSON> Egeland </PERSON>. He was returning Monday night from <LOCATION> Devils </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, about 40 miles to the southeast, when he apparently became disoriented. Overnight temperatures in the region had dropped to 20 degrees below zero or more. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, a volunteer in the search effort, came upon <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON>'s car shortly before 11 a.m. today. The vehicle was on a lightly travthat was blocked by a snowdrift. The boy was coherent when he was rescued, but was badly frostbitten on his feet and hands, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. He was listed in serious condieled rural road tion at <LOCATION> Towner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cando </LOCATION>. About 20 to 25 people, both officers and volunteers, helped in the search, <PERSON> Soderberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> had driven to <LOCATION> Devils </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> on Monday to take his older brother to the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> station there, <PERSON> Soderberg </PERSON> said. The brother was going to <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> to take a military pre-induction physical, the sheriff said. <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON>'s parents were already in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> visiting a sick relative, and discovered the boy was missing after th `` I'm trying to invest it wisely. I never had that much before and a couple of times I was down on hard times,'' she said, recalling the time she sold blood plasma to a local clinic for $ 30 a week. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON>, an assistant high school principal from <LOCATION> Barboursville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, has followed a similar play-it-safe pattern after winning $ 2 million in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> lottery in the spring of 1986 Flowers, 40, who continues working but whose wife quit her job, said most of his first lottery check went toward buying a new house. On his accountant's advice, 10 percent was placed in a tax-deferred retirement annuity and another 10 percent was reserved for his three children's college education. A small amount was invested in mutual funds and short-term tax-free municipal bonds. Flowers, like some other lottery winners interviewed, has avoided stocks. `` This has raised our overall standard of living and lowered our overall worry level,'' said Flowers. Most prize recipients say their main goal is maintaining a higher living standard, long after the lottery checks cease. Tax expert <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Feola </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaccetti </PERSON>, who has counseled lottery winners, says that can easily be done through diversified investments. But her first advice is that clients take things slow. `` It's the same thing as with someone who inherits a lot of money,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Scaccetti </PERSON>, a tax partner with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horwath </ORGANIZATION>. `` You usually try to slow the pace down, apply all the sound financial decision process ... as you would a wealthy individual who has earned money over a period of time.'' For the first two years most lottery winners might want to keep the money in high-yielding CDs or <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, Ms. <PERSON> Scaccetti </PERSON> said. Some banks, such as <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, offer special accounts for clients who suddenly have $ 1 million or more and need a place to park it. Of course, lottery winners also should be looking for ways to shelter themselves from taxes, such as tax-free municipal bonds or annuities, Ms. <PERSON> Scaccetti </PERSON> said. Later on, `` They need to ask themselves: ` Do I need to have a fixed return because I want to give up working, or do I want to continue working and put a fixed income amount set aside,'' she said. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, 39, a former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> producer from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, fell in both categories after winning $ 9.76 million in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lottery a year ago. Although his annual net income of $ 500,000 has kept himself and his wife out of the work force, they've been cautious. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> opted for investments most likely to appreciate, like a new $ 425,000, 3-bedroom house and a 1964 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud III. For tax reasons <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> obtained a 15-year home mortgage rather than paying cash. `` We're trying to be good stewards of this money,'' he said. `` After all, this sort of thing does n't even come once in a lifetime. Your chances of being struck by lightning are four times better.''

<TEXT>
 Part of an overloaded express train derailed Thursday near the port city of <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>, killing at least 13 people and injuring more than 70, officials and news reports said. The accident came less than three weeks after another train disaster that officials described as <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s worst ever. On Jan. 5, two trains collided head-on on the Dhaka-Chittagong tracks near <LOCATION> Tongi </LOCATION> just north of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, killing 114 people and injuring at least 1,000. The train in Thursday's accident was carrying about 2,100 passengers, three times its authorized capacity, the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sangbad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sangstha </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Many people were traveling on rooftops of the cars, and many others were hanging on the doors as there was a rush for going home for the weekend,'' it reported. People often ride atop overloaded trains in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Although official reports put the number of injured at about 70, the independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> said it was closer to 200. The Dhaka-bound train derailed near <LOCATION> Kumira </LOCATION>, 14 miles north of <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>. The government news agency said there were indications the derailment was caused by trouble with a dining car that was joined to the train at <LOCATION> Pahartali </LOCATION>, the train's previous stop. `` There was a mechanical fault in the dining car and it fell off the track 15 minutes after it was added to the train. It then pulled the two adjoining coaches,'' the agency quoted a railroad official as saying. One railroad official said six railroad employees fled after the derailment but returned about two hours later and were arrested and detained for questioning. Also on Thursday, a government official said investigators blamed railway officials for the head-on train crash last month near <LOCATION> Tongi </LOCATION>. He said railway officials had wrongly cleared both trains to travel on the same track. Earlier reports said the crash was caused by a faulty signaling system which was installed five days before the accident. At least four railway officials were suspended after the Jan. 15 accident. Further action would be taken against them in the light of the findings, he said, but was not specific.

 Former football star O.J. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> has been charged with beating his wife during an argument in which he allegedly hit and kicked her as he yelled, `` I'll kill you,'' authorities said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, 41, struck his 29-year-old wife, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>, and pulled her hair early New Year's Day at the couple's home here, according to police records. The city attorney's office filed the charges Monday. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> is scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 17 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Municipal Court. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rent-A-Car </ORGANIZATION> and a sports commentator, on Wednesday downplayed the incident. `` My wife and I had a fight; that's it,'' he said. `` We put it behind us.'' <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Randa </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, said neither he nor his wife wanted charges filed. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> is charged with one misdemeanor count of spousal battery, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualls </PERSON>, a spokesman for the city attorney's office. If convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in jail and a fine of up to $ 1,000. According to police reports, officers who arrived at the <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> home on Jan. 1 were kept outside by a security gate. They telephoned the home and were told by a housekeeper that no one had been hurt and that they should go away. Soon after police hung up, Mrs. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> ran to the gate and admitted an officer, saying her husband had beaten her up, the reports said. Mrs. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s face was marked with bruises and scratches, police said. She did not require treatment. According to police reports, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> yelled, `` I'll kill you'' at his wife as he struck her. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> initially denied beating his wife, but later told authorities that he and his wife had been drinking when a `` wrestling-type altercation'' began, the records said. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, the 1968 Heisman Trophy winner, was a star running back for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trojans </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bills </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers.

<TEXT>
 A man who sued the <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2 million claiming a bus accident left him so weak he needed a cane to walk, withdrew his claim after the TA showed the judge a videotape of him changing a tire. The case arose from an accident Feb. 27, 1983, in which a bus rear-ended a car driven by <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanafi </PERSON> of the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. `` The man claimed that he was reduced to walking with a shuffle with the aid of a cane and that he had lost so much strength in his upper body that he could no longer work as a counterman at a pizza joint,'' said TA spokesman <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>. `` His lawyer actually claimed in court that he was too weak to lift pizza dough.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Hanafi </PERSON>, who has since changed his name to <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, put <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> on the stand and called doctors to testify that he suffered post traumatic stress disorder. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> offered to settle the case for $ 250,000.'' <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said. `` We declined.'' TA lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Figliolia </PERSON> then produced the videotape, which was shown while the jury was out of the courtroom. The tape, made Jan. 25, showed <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> changing a tire while <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> watched. `` The tire must have weighed 40 pounds and he used one hand to throw it in the trunk and <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> stood around watching,'' <PERSON> Figliolia </PERSON> said. When the tape ended, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> withdrew his claim and the judge dismissed the case. <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said the videotape would be turned over to the district attorney and to the appellate division, `` because we feel the attorney should be subject to some discipline because he was supporting a phony claim.'' The telephone company had no listing for a <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>. A number for <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanafi </PERSON> was unlisted. He could not be reached for comment. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> defended his client saying, `` He was hit in the rear and he went straight to the hospital. He was taken straight from the scene by ambulance. He was unconscious.'' When asked if <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> was still suffering, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> replied: `` His doctors say he is.'' Asked why <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> withdrew the claim, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said, `` It was his decision.'' Last year there were 3,228 injury claims filed against the TA and $ 38.6 million was paid out, either in judgments or settlements.

 Rep. <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, urged farmers Thursday to buy crop insurance and follow `` every known practice of moisture conservation'' because critical drought conditions still prevail across portions of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the West and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, and <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>, chief meteorologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said that they are concerned about the winter wheat crop but that with good early spring rains, this year's harvest could be a good crop. Specific areas of concern they listed are the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> panhandles, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> rangeland and pockets of the Corn Belt from eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> southwest into <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` As farmers prepare for planting this year, their planning needs to include every possible moisture-saving measure, the utilization of drought-resistant plant varieties and a serious look at crop insurance,'' said de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. Although recent snow in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is a positive sign, `` it is not anything that would ease the situation,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` The projection for winter wheat is still a question mark,'' he said. `` There may be some injury with the extreme cold weather, but we ca n't tell yet. Overall, the projection is guarded but somewhat positive.'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said the situation in the winter wheat belt is `` encouragingly optimistic'' with short and long-range forecasts calling for normal amounts of precipitation. With good rains in early spring, `` we have the potential for seeing a significant revival of the crops' condition and the potential for a good crop.''

<HEAD>The Rain, it's Plain, Falls Increasingly in the South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It seems to be getting rainier south of the <LOCATION> Equator </LOCATION>, unlike the north where the moisture trend has been mixed, according to a new climate study. The report, in the January edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> _ Atmospheres, covers more than a century of weather records and indicates increased rainfall at Southern Hemisphere measuring stations. Such a finding would be consistent with the recently popular theory of a greenhouse-like warming of the climate, the study noted. The greenhouse theory holds that carbon dioxide and other gases being added to the atmosphere by humans will trap an increasing amount of the sun's heat, tending to warm the earth, somewhat like a greenhouse warms its interior. Warmer weather evaporating more water from the ocean could then lead to more rain. But R.S. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION>, one of the authors of the new report, was reluctant to tie the findings to that theory. `` We're tending to stay away from that issue. We do n't want to imply it's related in any way. We're just presenting the observed data,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said Thursday in a telephone interview. Nonetheless, the report noted that computer models of possible greenhouse effect changes do call for increased precipitation over the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the increased rainfall, the new report found indications of higher sea-surface temperatures and increased wind speeds over the southern oceans, which could lead to more evaporation and thus more rain. Those findings could also be a result of variations in instrument readings, however, the study said. It noted that because the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> is primarily water-covered there are far fewer weather measuring sites than in the more land-covered North. The strongest rainfall increase was detected in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, while there was a lesser effect in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and no trend was evident for <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the report said. The study contrasts with a 1987 analysis covering areas north of the Equator, which had more mixed results. That report found increased rainfall in temperate northern areas but a decline in rain in the tropics north of the Equator. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> noted that while the new findings indicate increased rainfall in <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> measurig points, that does n't necessarily translate to an overall increase in wetness for the planet's southern half The findings could be reversed if precipitation has declined over the vast southern ocean areas where no measurements are taken, the study said. In addition, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> noted that rainfall, and what amounts to an increase, can vary quite a lot from place to place. A small increase in rain over the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> basin </LOCATION>, for example, could amount to a decade-worth of moisture for the northern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> desert, for example, he said. Overall, the new analysis concluded that rain falling on land areas in the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> has increased since the 1940s, including an increase in the temperate latitudes starting in the 1970s. The report was prepared by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eischeid </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>.

 The city has lost its bid to tax the neighboring city of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> for using airspace over <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION>. A two-judge panel ruled Wednesday against <PERSON> Winooski </PERSON>'s unusual lawsuit, in which the city tried to make <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> pay $ 90,222 for the airspace used by planes at the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The lawsuit said the takeoffs and landings interfere with `` Winooski property owners' enjoyment of land and constitutes taking of <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION> land by <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chittenden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> and Assistant Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretkowski </PERSON> rejected that reasoning. `` Although air rights over land may be bought, sold, developed and taxed, such rights do not include airport runway cones for takeoff and landing,'' they ruled. <LOCATION> Winooski </LOCATION> officials said they were glad the case was taken seriously, although they were disappointed with the outcome. `` We'll appeal, as far as I'm concerned,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCourse </PERSON>, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would have to vote to appeal. The lawsuit was filed in March 1988, nearly two years after <PERSON> Winooski </PERSON> sent the tax bill to <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>. Winooski residents bothered by the noise from planes readily backed the suit. `` It's aggravating,'' one resident, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, said of the noise. `` It always happens right in the middle of the best TV shows.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has developed a tiny new transistor that can be used to build smaller, speedier computers and provide clearer pictures on TV sets, a spokesman said Thursday. The new `` quantum wire transistor'' uses wires one-tenth the thickness of those in conventional transistors, a company spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The new wires are five millionths of a millimeter thick, he said. The new transistor can be used to perform calculations at six times the speed possible with existing high electronic mobility transistors, the spokesman said. He also said the small size of the new transistor would permit the development of lap-top high-speed computers. The transistor also could be used to develop more sophisticated amplifiers for receiving broadcast waves from satellites and other objects in space, the spokesman said. He said the advance would help provide clearer pictures on TV sets.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo will visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the fall, a news report said Thursday, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> announced it was downgrading ties with <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to protest improving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean-Hungarian </LOCATION> relations. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has accepted an invitation to meet <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and plans to go in September or October, said the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> quoting an unidentified senior government official. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became the first communist nation to fully recognize <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by upgrading its diplomatic status with the capitalist country to the ambassador level on Wednesday. State Secretary for Foreign Affairs <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Wednesday that <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> had accepted the invitation to meet <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> FB-111 fighter-bomber jet crashed and exploded today in a wooded area in northeastern <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, but the two crewmen aboard parachuted to safety just seconds before it hit the ground. `` They were at about 1,000 feet when they separated,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Boog </PERSON>, a doctor who saw the crash from his car. `` Then the plane hit the ground and exploded. And it just disintegrated. There are parts scattered a quarter mile in every direction.'' `` It felt like an earthquake,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahr </PERSON>, who also saw the crash. `` If there was anybody left in the plane they would have been killed. It completely exploded.'' The plane, a medium-range fighter-bomber with a two-man crew, was based at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Plattsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, which is about 80 miles west of the crash site. Senior Airman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a public information officer at the air base, confirmed that both crewmen survived the crash, which occurred shortly before noon. The jet crashed less than a mile from a heavily traveled highway. `` We went up into the woods to look for them,'' <PERSON> Boog </PERSON> said. `` Apparently they landed close to a farm house. They radioed the other plane that was with them that they were OK.'' The jet crashed in a wooded area, just next to a field, less than a mile from Route 2 `` They did a good job tucking that plane where they did,'' <PERSON> Boog </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Godbut </PERSON> was in his front yard in neighboring <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, at 11:45 a.m. `` I heard an explosion, and I looked up in the air in the direction of the explosion,'' Godbut said. `` I could see a large giant puff ball of smoke, probably 300 to 400 feet across rising into the sky.''

Mayor <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> sent a letter welcoming the cat group to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>.

 East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is often confused and his behavior indicates he is in failing health, a West German newspaper reported Thursday.

<HEAD>Legislation Attacks Motherhood-for-Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s most conservative members joined with one of the most liberal Thursday to announce legislation against surrogate mother arrangements in which a woman is paid to conceive a child. The measure, introduced by Reps. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., contains no sanctions against the woman or the person who pays her to have a Instead, it is aimed primarily at brokers who take a fee to link women willing to have a baby for pay with couples willing to pay for a child. It calls for a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $ 50,000 fine for conviction of such brokering and provides that such contracts are unenforceable. Introduction of the bill came one day before the first anniversary of the famous `` Baby M'' case in which the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that a surrogate mother contract could not be enforced. While the legislation is designed to effectively end commercialized surrogate-mother contracts even if no broker is involved, <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said they did not propose criminal penalities for either the mother or the person who pays her because they consider both to be victims. `` In the case of surrogancy, there is a desperate, childless couple and a surrogate mother desperate for money,'' said <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>. `` Into this circumstance a commercial brokerage business has emerged which could lead to the creation of a new class of women in our society _ paid breeders, and eventually a new class of children who will be forced to accept the reality that their natural mothers sold them.'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said the practice of paying a woman to have a baby smacks of slavery. `` By reducing childbearing to an occupation, surrogancy arrangements attack the essential human dignity of every person,'' said <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>. The two representatives were joined at a news conference by <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, cochairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surrogancy </ORGANIZATION>. `` Commercialized childbearing denigrates human dignity because it places a commercial bond before a maternal bond,'' said <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>. The Boxer-Hyde bill technically applies only to surrogate mother arrangements in which interstate commerce is involved, but attorneys said the courts have given such a broad interpretation to interstate commerce that the bill effectively would stop almost all commercial surrogate mother contracts if it becomes law. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> is a leading opponent of abortion and <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> is a staunch proponent of a woman's right to have an abortion. Both turned aside questions about their differences on that issue and said just because they generally were at opposite poles on the conservative-liberal spectrum did not mean they did not respect each other and could not work together. After <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> went out of her way to praise <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s integrity, <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said he had always thought of her `` as an honest liberal because she is tolerant of different views.''

<HEAD>Jackson Says West Should Monitor Progress of Soviet Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Thursday the West can test Soviet reforms by cooperating in fund-raisers for Armenian earthquake victims, monitoring human rights cases and visiting factories converting from military to consumer production. `` I believe that at every level of glasnost and perestroika there must be verification,'' said the former Democratic presidential contender, who is visiting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the first time. `` The more people can see the transition taking place, the more people can be relieved of the Cold War tensions that have characterized our relationship for the last 40 years,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had seen signs of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms during a trip to the Armenian earthquake zone, in conversations with Soviet officals, and in a visit to a MiG fighter plane plant being converted to produce household appliances <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Sunday to promote his plan for a joint Soviet-American telethon to aid victims of the December earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and to assess the economic and political reforms under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he had asked to see a military factory being transformed to make consumer goods, because <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> mentioned such plants in a Dec. 7 speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` We could see on one side the production line making the MiGs, on the other side we could see where they were making the new equipment for the conversion,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said the plant would soon shift its production to washing machines, blenders and other household products. During a meeting with <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, a member of the Politburo, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> discussed the upcoming trials of five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, who were arrested in connection with ethnic unrest that has been festering between Armenians and Azerbaijanis for the past year. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> assured him the trials would be open to the press. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said four Jewish refuseniks have been granted permission to leave the country Thursday. He said one of the requests of his group was to gain exit visas for some Soviet Jews, but said he did not know the names of the four. During a trip to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> earlier this week, he viewed the devastation from the Dec. 7 earthquake and visited victims in hospitals. `` The crisis in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> becomes a real test for glasnost, perestroika and for our -LRB- <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s -RRB- own humanity,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he also met with the Soviet minister of culture and the head of <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION>, the Soviet state broadcasting committee, to discuss the quake fund-raiser, but that no concrete plans had been made or date set. But American celebrities like <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> have said they want to take part, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has indicated Soviet artists will be `` allowed to participate,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said the money will go to rebuild schools, hospitals, churches and set up prefabricated homes for some of the more than 500,000 people left homeless by the quake, which killed 25,000 people.

<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday criticized President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s exclusion of drug czar-designate <PERSON> Williiam </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> as `` a crucial mistake.'' Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the chairman, said his committee would hold hearings on <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s nomination March 1 and 2. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said he would have preferred to start the hearings earlier but agreed to later dates to give <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has no staff, time to prepare for the congressional questioning. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> used the announcement to criticize <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s omission from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet. `` I'm worried that the president has made a crucial mistake, maybe in part by oversight, by not having the drug coordinator at the table,'' said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Democrat. The director of national drug control policy, which will be the drug czar's formal title, `` has to do what none of the others -LRB- in the Cabinet -RRB- has to do,'' said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>. `` He has to take them on, as a practical matter. He is entering the most dangerous world in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and that is the world of fiefdoms.'' In establishing a national drug control policy, the director will be called upon to develop a strategy covering more than 30 agencies spread throughout the federal government and under the more direct control of individual secretaries, who are in the Cabinet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has defended his decision to leave <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> out of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, saying, `` The reason he is n't in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> is that I've tried to reduce down the numbers of full Cabinet members And I think that <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s time is best spent not worrying about agricultural subsidies but concentrating on drugs.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, argued <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s position at the committee meeting and said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> must have `` the backing of the president, and he will.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> acknowldeged, `` I have no right, nor does the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have a right, to tell him who will sit at his Cabinet table, but I think it's a tragic mistake, a terrible mistake if he continues that policy.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, has said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did n't consider the decision a `` serious problem. `` We have no doubt about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s seriousness about the drug issue, and his seriousness about his commitment to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as the guy in charge of this issue,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said that, once <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is confirmed, he `` must begin work immediately ... on developing a plan that has never been developed in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, and that is a comprehensive drug plan,'' which is due 180 days after the drug czar is confirmed, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The government on Thursday criticized <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> after a ship from the environmental group tangled for a week with Japanese whalers in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> left the whaling fleet Thursday, after giving the Japanese whale-shaped gingerbread cookies with a note, `` If you want to eat whales, eat these,'' according to group spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> had been trying to prevent four Japanese ships from whaling in the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> collided with the Japanese mother ship, the 23,000-ton Nisshin Maru No. 3, but there were no injuries and little damage. `` I understand <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> is conducting obstructive activities while the research whaling fleet is conducting legal and legitimate activities,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said Thursday. `` As the research ships' activities are in line with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> guidelines, those obstructive activities are unjustifiable,'' <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> told reporters at a weekly news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had filmed the Japanese whaling fleet while it harpooned and electrocuted minke whales. It said it would give the film to the whaling commission. <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, interviewed by radio telephone aboard the <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION>, called the cookie packages `` a parting gift.'' He said the note attached to the cookies also read: `` We bear no animosity to the Japanese people or members of the Japanese ships.'' He said one of the Japanese boats relayed a message thanking <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> for the package. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks. Such research is allowed under a moratorium imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whaling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The regulations are to be reevaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research. However, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> contends most of the whale meat taken by Japanese boats will end up in sushi restaurants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Japanese whaling and government officials have accused <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> of engaging in `` terrorist'' tactics and endangering lives. However, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said Thursday use of that word was `` regrettable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said its presence temporarily halted the hunt and drew international attention to the plight of whales. The group estimated the Japanese had harpooned 55 minke whales. In <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> supporters in blood-spattered overalls on Thursday delivered bags of imitation whale meat to the Japanese Embassy and cultural center to protest the whale kill. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its ship was headed toward a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base on <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> Sound. The group says that area has been badly polluted.

 <PERSON> Groundhog </PERSON> <PERSON> Punxsutawney </PERSON> <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>, prognosticating with political flair, was pulled out of his burrow at dawn Thursday and saw his shadow, predicting six more weeks of a `` kinder and gentler winter.'' Despite an overcast sky, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>'s handlers from the <ORGANIZATION> Punxsutawney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groundhog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> claimed he saw a faint shadow at 7:28 a.m. Tradition has it that if the weather-wise woodchuck sees his shadow, six more weeks of winter follow. If he does n't, spring is just around the corner. `` In honor of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the groundhog stood tall and proud. He spotted a thin, short shadow,'' club President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON> told hundreds of spectators at Gobbler's Knob, a wooded knoll about three miles south of this western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> mountain town of 8,000 people `` The king of all groundhogs is returning to his burrow with a promise of a kinder and gentler winter,'' Means said. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>'s forecasts do n't always hold up, but his handlers nevertheless claim he has n't been wrong for the past 101 years. Punxsutawney's tradition has given rise to four-legged forecasters elsewhere, and most of them broke with <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> and predicted an early spring Thursday. In <LOCATION> Lilburn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, a groundhog dubbed General <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> failed to see a shadow, as did <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Concord Charlie and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freddy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buckeye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chuck </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, Rowdy, a groundhog at the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> the Groundhog in <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, celebrated `` Quahog Day'' by having a man dressed as a quahog, a type of clam, come out of his shell The quahog failed to see his shadow. In <LOCATION> Quarryville </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, Octarara Orphie sided with <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>. But it is in Punxsutawney that the tradition is most entrenched. Several hours before sunrise, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> is taken from his year-round home in a glass-enclosed case next to the town library and shoved into a man-made, heated burrow atop Gobbler's Knob. The woodchuck, which usually hibernates until March, is hoisted at dawn to the glare of television floodlights and flashbulbs, and his prediction is announced. But the 14 tuxedo-clad members of the groundhog club's `` Inner Circle'' actually decide <PERSON> Phil </PERSON>'s prediction in advance. Groundhog Day is based on an old Scottish couplet: `` If Candlemas Day is bright and clear, there will be two winters in the year.'' Feb. 2 is the Christian holiday of Candlemas.

The foreign ministers agreed Thursday that international supervision is needed to ensure peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ends its occupation, which began in late 1978 with an invasion that replaced the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> with a pro-Hanoi regime. Last month, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed in principle that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by September and that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would gradually reduce its aid to the guerrilla groups. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has called for an armed supervisory force to oversee the withdrawal, but <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has rejected that plan. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> agreed the guerrilla factions and the Vietnamese-backed government should be allowed to determine <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s political makeup without outside interference. But both countries implied they want a say in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s interim government, which will undoubtebly affect the future Cambodian state. Details of the consensus' remaining points were not released. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the two sides also agreed to set up a group to negotiate reduction of arms and troops in the border areas, the site of a small war in 1969. In a speech later to the banquet, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called for joint ventures between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, cooperation in science and technology and transformation of their border into a region of `` peace, friendship and good-neighborly cooperation.'' He painted a broad picture of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s hopes for its relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> after the summit between Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. If the summit takes place, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> would reach a level not seen since the 1950s, when thousands of Soviet advisers worked in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The nations clashed over ideology and personal matters in 1960. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he understood ties could never return to their previous form, when <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> played the younger sibling to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Chinese and Russians used to love an old song on the Trans-Siberian railroad many years ago,'' he said. `` But time changes and gives us new songs. And just as songs change, so must the relationship between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' Relations began to improve in the early 1980s as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began a reform program and after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power in 1985. On Friday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will meet again with <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> and then hold talks with Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. Friday night he will fly to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to meet <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Senators Uneasy with Tower's Assurances He Can Avoid Conflicts of

<TEXT>
 After four days of confirmation hearings, senators remained uneasy Thursday with assurances from Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> that he could avoid conflicts of interests stemming from more than $ 1 million he received as defense consultant. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> postponed a confirmation vote to consult with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> about an investigation it conducted into Tower's professional and private lives, including persistent complaints that he had a drinking problem and was a womanizer. On Wednesday, Tower denied that he had a drinking problem and senators emerging from a closed-door session said they had received assurances there were no other difficulties stemming from his private life. Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., a member of the committee, described the information as `` different'' and `` still relatively old. Asked whether it dealt with Tower's personal or professional life, <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> said, `` possibilities in both areas.'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said during questioning Wednesday that he had not yet seen information he had requested from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Most of the concern expressed by senators during the hearings related to possible conflicts of interest between Tower and defense contractors for whom he worked. The most pointed questioning during four days of hearings came from <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., who pressed Tower on whether he saw the appearance of conflict of interest stemming from his transition from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiating team to defense contractor to defense secretary Tower provided documentary evidence that he had severed all financial ties with the contractors. He said he gone beyond legal requirements to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. He also argued that his contributions to defense contractors were at once `` valuable'' and `` intangible.'' `` I gave them sort of academic advice on what could happen,'' he testified. `` Any number of think tanks in town could have given them more detailed analysis.'' `` Being available at the end of a telephone ... is of value to people,'' he said. His advice, he said, did not involve classified matter and `` was all enlightened guesswork.'' `` Yes, but it was enlightened,'' retorted an exasperated <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, insisting that `` We have to assume that this is a troubling appearance.'' Here's a breakdown of the fees that Tower collected and the services he rendered during 2 -LCB- years as a defense consultant, based on documents and testimony: _ <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>, $ 265,000. Board member and adviser on appropriations in fiscal 1988-89. _ <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 246,860. `` I monitored developments'' on aircraft. `` I visited <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and Turkish government officials to promote those countries' procrement of the <ORGANIZATION> MLRS </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Multiple-Launch Rocket System.'' _ <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 166,750. `` I provided senior management with personal views on future funding of the B-1'' bomber built by <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 154,167. `` I served as a sounding board and gave advice as to political and strategic developments that would affect R & amp; D -LRB- research and development -RRB- funding ...'' _ <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, $ 153,334. Assisted the British firm in the acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, $ 116,000. `` I discussed with senior management the -LRB- Chinese -RRB- Long March missile'' and analyzed the implications of legislation on strategic offensive and defensive programs. _ <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 70,000. `` I briefed senior management on defense and commercial future of the V-22'' aircraft and `` discussed a possible new production facility for the company in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' _ <ORGANIZATION> Astrotech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, $ 16,000.

 F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, elected Thursday to replace President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is a pragmatist who has tried to avoid ideological labels. The nation's education minister, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has been viewed for several years as the leading contender to succeed <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as president, and he is now more clearly than ever the favorite. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> plans to stay on as head of state for the time being, despite his recent stroke, but <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> will play a role in policy-making. A former attorney, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, 52, is considered slightly more conservative than his main rivals for the party leadership post, but he does not describe himself in such terms. `` It's to the advantage of people in some quarters to label me,'' he said in an interview with Leadership magazine last year. `` It is part of an attempt to push me in a direction I do not want to go.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> comes from a long line of politicians. His great-grandfather was a senator, and his father, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, was Cabinet minister from 1955 to 1968. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Willem </PERSON>, formerly was editor of Rapport, a nationally circulated, pro-government Sunday newspaper. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> quit his newspaper job under fire for his increasingly liberal editorial stance. He now is involved in negotiations aimed at uniting the country's white, anti-apartheid political parties to challenge the Nationalists. F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> on March 18, 1936. He received a law degree in 1958 and began work as an attorney in <LOCATION> Vereeniging </LOCATION>, an industrial city south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. He was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Vereeniging </LOCATION> in 1972, became a Cabinet member in 1978 and was elected <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> in 1982. <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> subsequently developed into a stronghold for the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s limited concessions to blacks, who are in the majority. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has devoted considerable energy trying to halt the rise of the Conservatives, who won 23 parliamentary seats in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, however, has 133 seats nationwide and maintains firm control of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

 A man who volunteered to coach his daughter's grade school basketball team and was then dismissed because he has AIDS was reinstated Thursday while school officials review his case. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, 37, was dismissed last week after only one game as coach of the intramural team at <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Administrators cited a new AIDS policy that requires school employees suspected of carrying the AIDS virus to be tested and their cases reviewed by a committee of health and school officials. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Community Schools, said at a news conference Thursday that <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> would be allowed to continue coaching after all, at least until the school board decides whether his condition constitutes a public health threat. He said he hoped a decision could be made in about two weeks. He said he believed <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s condition `` is not such as to consitute an immediate health threat.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who had launched a petition drive to be reinstated, said he was happy to be going back to work. `` I really feel good about it,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` I believe their decision will come out in my favor.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from tainted blood products used during open heart surgery in 1984. He was diagnosed as having AIDS last June. Before Thursday's announcement temporarily reinstating him, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> had criticized the decision to suspend him, as did the parents of some of his players. <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Cable </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Metamora </LOCATION>, whose 10-year-old son is on <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s coed team, said, `` Everybody's afraid of AIDS, but I do n't think breeding stupidity into our children will make it go away.'' `` It's been blown out of proportion,'' added another team parent, <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrain </PERSON>. `` I do n't see anything wrong with him coaching the team. I'm not worried about it _ but there's always a chance, I guess.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> had vounteered to coach the team of fourth -, fifth - and sixth-graders when his daughter decided to play at the school, 60 miles southeast of He and his wife, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, also have a 14-year-old son at the school. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said he told a school official last June about his diagnosis and was unsure why it was n't until last week that they tried to dismiss him. AIDS, which attacks the body's immune system, is transmitted primarily through sexual contact, sharing of needles intravenous drug use and blood transfusions, but not through casual contact.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposed Thursday to sharply increase inspection user fees on imported flue-cured and burley tobacco. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that all flue-cured and burley that is affirmed by importers to be free of prohibited pesticides is currently assessed fees of 0.1 cents per pound for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> verification.

 A state trooper, who notched more drunken driving arrests in <LOCATION> Travis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1988 than any other lawman, lied on reports and under oath, and more than 150 cases will be tossed out, authorities said.

 A report questioning the effectiveness of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> systems to defend against low-flying missiles has prompted a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee to schedule hearings on the program, a congressional aide said Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials, ordered hearings to be held in March, said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGennaro </PERSON>, an aide to the congressman Declassified portions of the report, prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said that May 1984 tests of the Phalanx anti-missile system were done without interference from other weapons, radars and active shipboard electronic countermeasures that might exist in combat situations. Reps. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, requested the report after the May 17, 1987, incident in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in which the USS Stark was hit by two Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi Mirage aircraft Thirty-seven Americans died in the attack. The Stark was equipped with a Phalanx anti-missile system, a computer-controlled system that shoots down missiles at close range. `` I am concerned that not enough attention was paid to the effectiveness of the radars and fire control systems aboard the Stark,'' <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON> said. `` These systems are supposed to warn the crew of airborne threats, such as the deadly Exocet missiles which hit the Stark, and allow the crew sufficient time to respond. `` While the official <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report and report of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> absolved the equipment of any blame, Mr. <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON> and I believe those reports raise questions about the effectiveness of the ship's system,'' she said.

 A 16-year-old boy was stranded in his car for 2 -LCB- days about six miles from home as temperatures dropped to 32 degrees below zero before rescuers found him Thursday. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> of rural <PERSON> Egeland </PERSON> had only a stocking cap, light jacket, sweatshirt and car mats for warmth after his car became stuck in snow, authorities said. He was listed in serious condition at the <LOCATION> Towner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in this northeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> town. <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> was coherent when rescued, but had severe frostbite on his feet and hands. His first words to his rescuers were, `` Thank you for looking for me,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who found him. <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> was returning Monday night from <LOCATION> Devils </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, about 40 miles to the southeast, when his car got stuck, said <LOCATION> Towner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderberg </PERSON>. The boy had taken a brother to the <ORGANIZATION> Devils </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> station, the sheriff said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Krumweide </PERSON>, who came upon <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON>'s car Thursday morning, said the vehicle was on a lightly traveled rural road blocked by a snowdrift. An arctic cold front has dominated <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> since Monday night, plunging temperatures to 20 to 30 degrees below zero. Howling winds have driven the wind-chill index to 90 below in some locations. <PERSON> Soderberg </PERSON> said the temperature at <LOCATION> Cando </LOCATION> reached 20 below Wednesday and 32 below Thursday morning. <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> told <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> he was unsuccessful at trying to dig his car out. The car's engine eventually died, leaving the boy without heat, <PERSON> Soderberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON>'s parents were in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> visiting a sick relative and did not discover their son was missing until their return Wednesday morning, <PERSON> Soderberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> was coherent but `` too wrung out to show any emotion'' aside from saying, `` I'm thankful that I'm alive.''

<TEXT>
 Mild electrical shocks and ammonia vapors could be used in efforts to reshape the thinking of some sex offenders under two measures approved Thursday by the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 96-0 for a joint resolution calling for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> to institute a program aimed at curing convicted sex offenders of deviant urges. The House then voted unanimously for a bill requiring the program to be installed at the <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Both measures now go to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The program, still being formulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, could use aversion therapy, group counseling or other components, said spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Massie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said Corrections officials hope to have the program in place in the next six months. He said legislative approval is not required, but Corrections officials hope the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> will appropriate funds for the program. No funding was included in the measures passed Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, author of the joint resolution, said the recidivism rate for sex offenders is about 80 percent where no treatment program is offered, but it drops to from 5 percent to 33 percent after participation in a program. `` In one study, it was shown that 53 offenders committed over 25,000 offenses. Consequently, if there is even a 50 percent -LRB- cure -RRB-, you reduce victimization by some 12,000,'' he said. Participation in the program would be voluntary, and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> estimated it could be implemented at a cost of $ 500,000 or less. Eleven states now have treatment programs for sex offenders, and <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said Corrections officials have reviewed nine or 10 of them. An <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> program uses aversion therapy, including mild electric shocks and ammonia fumes, to correct inmates when they fall into deviant ways of thinking. `` These are proven methods of treatment that have been around a lot longer than most people realize,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman-Longo </PERSON>, the developer of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s program and a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not ` Clockwork Orange' treatment,'' he said, referring to a movie in which aversion therapy was used to reshape a violent inmate's thinking. But <PERSON> Massie </PERSON> said too much emphasis has been placed on the aversion therapy aspect of the program. `` That's just one component,'' he said.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Gas Tax Hike Preferable to Oil Import Fee</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Thursday he would prefer a gasoline tax increase to an oil import fee in the event <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not meet its deficit-reduction targets through spending cuts alone. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he would most prefer that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut spending to meet the fiscal 1990 deficit target of $ 100 billion. Pressed, however, on how to acheive that goal after weighing defense considerations and domestic priorities that rule out spending cuts, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said higher gasoline taxes would be the least disruptive tax to the economy and would have `` certain advantages'' to the nation's long-term energy posture. `` All taxes do harm _ over the long run expenditures tend to creep up and absorb any increases in them,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. `` But, with certain limitations, some do less harm than others.'' Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., the committee's chairman, has long supported an increase in the federal tax of 9 cents a gallon on gasoline as a way of helping balance the budget <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> had endorsed an increase in gasoline taxes more than a year ago, but his qualified support Thursday was the first since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken office. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman said higher gasoline taxes would be preferable to oil import fees because any gas tax increase would come `` at the tail end of the business process'' and therefore would not reverberate through the economy. `` It's only in that sense that I feel that it is the lesser evil,'' he said. `` ... Allowing deficits to persist courts a dangerous corrosion of our economy and risks potentially significant reductions over time in our standard of living.'' With each penny per gallon yielding a $ 1 billion in revenues, gradual increases of five cents a year in the gas tax levy are becoming more attractive to many lawmakers as a way of reducing the federal deficit. But they are widely opposed in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West, where people drive more than in the rest of the country and would have to bear much of any increase. The government ended the 1988 fiscal year with a budget deficit of $ 155.1 billion, $ 11.1 billion over the $ 144 billion target for that year established by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. With no new taxes or spending, the White House budget office projects the 1990 deficit will fall to $ 127 billion, even assuming a 3.5 percent rate of growth and a decline in interest rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, assuming a slower growth rate and higher interest rates, predicts the the 1990 deficit would be a $ 146 billion without new taxes or spending cuts.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opened an ideology conference Thursday aimed at charting a new course following a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> offer to allow the opposition to organize and participate in running the country. Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the leader of the nation and the party, delivered the opening address to 469 party members and hundreds of observers from other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries gathered in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is living through a time of great transformations. They are being born among various contradictions, in the course of discussions and disputes in the increasingly broad socialist dialogue,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said. `` Hence our expectation the conference will answer questions about the current shape of values and principles of socialism, their presence in political and economic transformations, the essence of pluralism, and directions of further chances in the party itself,'' he said. Issues of ownership, the political system itself and changes in the party are among the main topics at the meeting, said <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyz </PERSON>, head of the party's ideological department, in an interview with the news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. The party convened the conference at a time when there is open criticism among its members over a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> offer made at a party plenum Jan. 18 to negotiate the legalization of the banned trade union Solidarity. The party-sanctioned martial law crackdown in December 1981 crushed the Soviet bloc's only independent trade union and parliament formally banned the union about a year later. At the plenum, 20 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commitee </ORGANIZATION> members opposed trade union pluralism, Politburo member <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON> told the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Polityka </ORGANIZATION>. The future of the union as well as political and economic reforms will be discussed when party officials, government representatives and members of the opposition open talks Feb. 6. `` Agreement combined with opening to broadly perceived pluralism will not be easy and will also be a struggle,'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said. `` But we want this process to be marked by political culture, mutual respect which overcomes confrontational stereotypes, rancor and resentment.'' Politburo member <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON>, designated to prepare the ideological conference, said Monday the conference `` is merely concerned with ideology and theory. It can not take any personnel changes. It can not take any other binding conclusions.'' <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> said that the party has more than 2 million members and that less than 100 members had handed in their party cards after the decision on Soldiarity. <PERSON> Czyz </PERSON> said the Polish party had been following changes in other socialist countries and that party scientists and theoreticians had met with their counterparts from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> before the conference. The closed-door sessions of the conference will continue until Saturday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday rebuffed federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' request that the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conduct evidence hearings in his impeachment trial. Instead, the committee called for a panel of 12 lawmakers to conduct hearings that would be televised so senators could watch if they chose. `` There will be no question about the fairness of it,'' Rules Committee Chairman <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., said as his panel approved, 9-0, a plan under which <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders would name six <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and six <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers to hear evidence The 52-year-old <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> jurist is accused of plotting to get a $ 150,000 payoff. Under the committee's plan, which is expected to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would first hold hearings on <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>' motions to dismiss the charges against him Then the 12-senator panel would convene to hear perhaps six weeks of evidence concerning <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who is the first black official ever to be impeached. He is also the first black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved 413-3 on Aug. 8 a bill of impeachment alleging that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge conspired with a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney to obtain money from two convicted racketeers in exchange for a guarantee they would not serve time. It also accuses him of making false statements at the 1983 trial in which a federal jury acquitted him of conspiracy in that case. The bill of impeachment also accuses <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> of disclosing information obtained by the government from a wiretap. It says his action wrecked a federal criminal investigation. Impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> now faces the second step in the process, trial by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. If convicted by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he will be removed from his $ 89,500 post on the bench. House members act as prosecutors, and there is no appeal from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s decision <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, who was not on hand for the Rules Committee session, says he is innocent. He was n't in his chambers Thursday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and could n't be reached immediately for comment on the ruling. He has been saying that all of the senators who will vote on the charges should hear the evidence in person and see the demeanor of the witnesses, not merely read a committee transcript. Lawmakers, however, have been wary about tying up the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor for six weeks or more. Shunting such sessions into a committee is a procedure devised in the 1930s after a painfully long impeachment trial. `` We have other constitutional responsibilities,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. The procedure was not used until 1986 when impeached District Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> sought in vain to hang onto his black robe, even though he already was serving a prison sentence for tax evasion. In the current case, the <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> left it up to the special 12-member panel to decide if the television signals from the evidence hearings would be sent by closed circuit only to senators' offices or made available to the public The Claiborne trial was broadcast nationwide by the <ORGANIZATION> Cable-Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- C-SPAN -RRB-. The evidence hearings also will be videotaped for viewing by senators in their offices. `` The video will give us an opportunity to accommodate Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> in his request that we watch the demeanor of the witnesses,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. Before the evidence phase of the trial gets under way, perhaps in March, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must first act on motions by <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, to dismiss the counts against him. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said he thought such matters could be cleared up within 30 days. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> law professor, said he thought the scheduling of motions was `` sensible'' and represents `` some recognition of the seriousness of the issues.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> repeated his argument that leaving the case to a panel was unconstitutional, although he said it could prove beneficial to <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. `` The argument is at least you'll have the full attention of 12 senators instead of people wandering in and out. But I'm not sure that's constitutional,'' he said. `` Judge <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is not fighting just to keep a job; he's fought to vindicate constitutional principle.''

 A bipartisan group of senators is asking <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to allow imposition of tougher miles-per-gallon standards for 1990 cars. A department spokesman, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON>, said today that no decision would be made on the standards until <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> reviews the matter. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said he doubts that the new secretary has yet seen the senators' letter, which was sent Wednesday. The letter asked <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to allow the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standard to go to 27.5 miles per gallon for the 1990 model year. That would mean an automobile manufacturer would have to meet that standard as an average for all cars produced. The current standard is 26.5 miles per gallon, allowed by former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> although a fuel conservation law calls for it to be one point higher. The law allows the transportation secretary to relax the standard year by year and <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> would have to take such action for the standard not to increase for 1990 models. The automotive industry says government imposition of mileage standards forces it to produce smaller cars that the buying public does n't want. A bill was introduced Wednesday to abolish the standards. The senators, led by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, who is ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>, praised <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> for showing `` a refreshing sensitivity to environmental concerns'' when he appeared before the committee last week. Others signing the letter were Sens. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash.; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> The senators said <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>'s action allowing a lower standard was taken `` at the same time that evidence was mounting and suggesting that, if anything, to help control the problem of global climate change that results from the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from motor vehicles, we should be tightening the standards, not relaxing them.'' It urged <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to reject all petitions to relax the standards and asked that he consult with senators opposed to the lower standard before announcing his decision. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the rules cause the economy to suffer in his home state and the nation He introduced again a bill which died last session without action by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whose chairman, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the fuel-economy standards appeared to be working fairly well <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, in introducing the measure, said, `` CAFE is a government regulation that is simply not needed.'' He said with the rules, the two largest domestic automakers, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, `` face the unfortunate prospect of having to limit or stop selling some of the most popular cars in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today.''

 Indian soldiers opened fire Thursday on student demonstrators at a university in a northern town, killing at least two people and injuring eight, police said. A police official said on condition of anonymity that the students in <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> were protesting the killing of another student by Indian troops on Wednesday. The students were mostly ethnic Tamils. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has about 47,000 troops in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to put down an insurrection by Tamil militants, who have been fighting for an independent homeland since 1983. An official at the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> said there were no reports of such shooting Thursday. However, the official said Indian soldiers killed five Tamil rebels in two areas in the north. Meanwhile, militants from the majority Sinhalese community killed at least eight supporters of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the southern town of <LOCATION> Matara </LOCATION>, police said. They said the victims were killed in separate attacks Wednesday. Another governing party supporter was killed in the town of <LOCATION> Wattegama </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, they said. Sinhalese militants have killed at least 1,000 people in an anti-government campaign launched in July 1987. They say the government sold out the Sinhalese community by signing an accord to end the Tamil rebellion. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sponsored the July 29, 1987, accord because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. But <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> moved in soldiers to quell the insurgency after the largest Tamil rebel group reneged on the peace plan. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. They say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population. In other violence reported Thursday, police said the bodies of three suspected Sinhalese extremists were found and a supporter of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was killed in other towns in the south. Police said the killings of political party supporters appeared to be aimed at disrupting general elections set for Feb. 15. Sinhalese extremists oppose holding the elections. Meanwhile, a little-known group called the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be pro-government, has been killing suspected Sinhalese extremists over the past two months.

 Israeli officials on Thursday sharply played down Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s offer to withdraw troops from some <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> cities, following strong opposition from Jewish settlers. Palestinians also have rejected <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan, saying it is a ploy to cheat them out of statehood. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a Palestinian was killed in a clash with troops, bringing the Palestinian death toll in the uprising to 371. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was simply quoting the 1978 Camp David accords Wednesday when he made the withdrawal offer. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> denied it was part of a new peace initiative. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said troops could be withdrawn from some <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> cities and deployed elsewhere if Palestinians accepted autonomy as an interim solution to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. He noted troop redeployment also was called for in the Camp David accords. `` If this -LRB- withdrawal -RRB- proposal is accepted, terrible things will happen,'' Rabbi <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, a militant founder of the Jewish settlement movement, told <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, who was touring <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlements. `` There will be riots and demonstrations by tens of thousands -LRB- of Palestinians -RRB- ... They will go out from the cities and conduct pogroms,'' said <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>, who is under investigation in the slaying of a <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> shopkeeper during a stone-throwing incident. Rabbi <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleicher </PERSON> agreed it would be a mistake to withdraw troops. `` Each concession will cause greater difficulties. If we pull back from the first line, we have to fight on the second line,'' he told <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, visibly embarrassed by <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON>'s outburst, tried to de-emphasize the importance of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s remarks. `` Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has on a number of occasions, and most recently yesterday ... quoted from the Camp David accords, and these are accords to which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are committed,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadassah </LOCATION>, a settler enclave in downtown <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. Palestinians oppose autonomy as a ploy to cheat them out of statehood and have rejected both the Camp David accords and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s offer <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s former foreign minister, <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the withdrawal would n't work because it is a unilateral move. `` A peace proposal ... requires reactions on the other side -LRB- but -RRB- here we can decide for ourselves just to get up in the morning and do it,'' said <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, who was in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> addressing a conference on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s comments were not part of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace initiative. `` When the Israeli government will come forth with a diplomatic initiative, I think it will be quite clear and unambiguous,'' said <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said a peace initiative would contain `` new ideas based on Camp David'' and would be presented when <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this spring. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> assured settlers they had his full support, but he also urged them to improve ties with their Arab neighbors. `` A life side-by-side with the Arabs, this is one of our goals,'' he said. `` It's up to you to develop these ties.'' More than 70,000 Jewish settlers live among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Settlers complained to <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> about frequent stone-throwing attacks by Palestinians but vowed the violence would not make them leave the area. Legislator <PERSON> Hanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Porath </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> urged the government to rehabilitate Palestinian refugee camps, starting with Dheishe. Dheishe is surrounded by a nearly 9-foot-high fence to stop residents from throwing stones at cars at the adjacent highway. `` The refugees are living like monkeys behind that fence, and there is an obligation to rehabilitate them,'' <PERSON> Porath </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> did not respond to the call. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Fahme </LOCATION>, a Palestinian was shot and killed in a clash with troops, the army said. Arab hospital officials identified the victim as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Saabneh </PERSON>, 22, of the nearby village of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rai </LOCATION>. Three Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the report. Also Thursday, residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of <LOCATION> Bracha </LOCATION> clashed with shepherds from the neighboring Arab village of <LOCATION> Burin </LOCATION>, said officials at <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Three <LOCATION> Burin </LOCATION> residents, including a 12-year-old boy, were hospitalized with beating injuries, the officials said. The shepherd's dog was killed in the fighting. The army said it was checking the report. Also Thursday, nine left-wing members of parliament sent a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> demanding that courts in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> stop ordering the detention of Palestinian youth below the age of 16. `` We informed the ministry about cases from the last two weeks and told them that we are afraid that the norms of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> are coming into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a legislator from the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said it was common practice in the occupied lands to detain youth before trial. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman denied that courts in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> detain minors, who under Israeli law are youth below the age of 14. `` We recieved the letter and investigated and we did not find any Arab under the age of 14 who had been arrested,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Etti </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshed </PERSON>. `` According to the law no one under the age of 14 can be arrested. We are going to ask the members of <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- parliament -RRB- to present specific cases.''

<HEAD>Central Committee to Discuss Politburo Member's Comments on '56 Revolt</HEAD>

 A Politburo member who veered from the official version of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt and called it a popular uprising will have to answer to party leaders for his views, newspapers said Thursday. In an unprecedented move, the ruling Politburo called a meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> 10 days ahead of schedule to discuss <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s comments. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a leading reformer, said over the weekend the revolt, which was quashed by Soviet tanks, was not a counterrevolution, as the official view says, but a popular uprising. Party leader <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> publicly disagreed with <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukacs </PERSON>, who sits on the 11-member Politburo, was quoted as telling <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> party activists <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s statement was his `` personal view.'' `` As a result of what happened in the last few days, the Politburo decided ... to seek the opinion of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Lukacs </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the four major state-run dailies. He said the meeting would be held Feb. 10, 10 days ahead of schedule. Another Politburo member, <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON>, said the official term of counterrevolution for the uprising was a `` simplification,'' but `` the contrary view is another oversimplification,'' Hungarian radio reported. It quoted <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON> as saying there was need for analysis of the 1956 events. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said his opinion was based on a report by a committee he heads that is reviewing <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s recent history. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> said a four-hour discussion followed <PERSON> Lukacs </PERSON>'s speech, with party members demanding a look at the 100-page report on which <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said he based his assessment. A Western diplomat said he had heard the report would be published in a party monthly in March. The dispute and a controversial suggestion by chief <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> ideologist <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> that the party might not be able to lead <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> out of its economic and social woes have prompted speculation about possible changes in the ruling elite. Another Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Lukacs </PERSON>' statement indicated <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> might lose his seat on the ruling Politburo, gained at a party conference in May that swept reformers into top posts. That conference also replaced 38 people on the 108-member Central Committee. But it remains dominated by more conservative party members, who won their seats under former party leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s popularity outside the party, in particular with many of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s independent groups, would make it dangerous for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to oust him. <PERSON> Lukacs </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session also should set `` a suitable date'' for the next party congress, now due in 1990.

<HEAD>U.S. to Help Clean Up Oil Spill; Penguins Threatened</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear were bound for <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> on Thursday to tackle a fuel oil spill that officials said threatened baby penguins about to take their first swim. A giant <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-5 Galaxy cargo plane carrying the gear and experts landed in <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, on the straits of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency <PERSON> Orbe </PERSON> reported. From there, the mission was to board the Polar <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research ship bound for the spill, about 590 miles south of the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> staff for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Polar </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> was to depart Friday and take about four days to reach the spill, just off the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and about two miles from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientific base Palmer Station. `` Our concern right now is primarily for the birds,'' he told reporters at <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s airport. `` All the young penguins are just about at the age where they take their first swim. `` When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could be the last time.'' There were conflicting reports of the extent of the spill, which occurred when an Argentine research and supply boat hit a rock Saturday and listed before sinking Tuesday. The 9,300-ton vessel, the <ORGANIZATION> Paradise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION>, was carrying 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel, according to the Science Foundation. The boat was leaking fuel oil at an undetermined rate, and hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of compressed gas had slipped from its decks, the foundation said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday `` there really was n't a -LRB- significant -RRB- spill.'' A short communique issued by the Argentine navy said its planes will fly over the sunken vessel `` to make a visual evaulation of the damage and take photographs that allow us to decide the best means to employ to combat the effects that could be presented.'' Also, an icebreaker was to arrive at the scene Friday to `` assess the best ways available to combat the pollution,'' the communique said. Some environmental experts and scientific groups have said hundreds of gallons of fuel oil leaked from the ship and created a slick up to 16 miles long, but the Chilean navy said the reports appeared exaggerated. `` The information that we have is that there is no big spill,'' said <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barros </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, however, that a slick did exist and that personnel at Palmer Station were gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around the grounded ship. `` The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200 barrels in the water'' that slipped from the vessel's deck, <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. `` And there's still oil coming out of the ship.'' <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the cleanup mission and directs all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> activities in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, feared lasting environmental damage. Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick had caused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface, <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s delicate, unspoiled environment requires special measures to contain the spill, which is near two areas set aside for special scientific study under terms of the Antarctic Treaty. `` In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals to recover from an accident,'' he said. `` But in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, it takes plants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold. It's a very, very fragile environment.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cargo plane, which is twice the size of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, carries a 35-foot `` skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat and inflatable booms to contain drifting oil. The cleanup work will be peformed by <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said. The Chilean navy said it will provide logistical support and dispatch its own ship with scientists and equipment to assist `` in case any contamination exists.''

<HEAD>Soviet TV Hires World's Biggest Ad Agency to Attract Western Advertisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KATZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet television viewers could soon be exposed to regular doses of something all too familiar to Westerners: commercials. The prospect arose at a news conference Thursday to announce that the world's biggest advertising agency, <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, has been hired to advise the Soviets on how to attract Western advertisers and their hard currency. The idea is to build up corporate images and familiarize Soviets with the types of products they can expect from President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s consumer-oriented reforms. `` Since our audience is not used to commercials at all, it's a sort of entertainment for them,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarassova </PERSON>, head of legal services at <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION>, the government broadcasting agency. <PERSON> Gostelradio </PERSON> has hired the London-based <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON> as its exclusive worldwide consultant. `` The purpose of the consultancy is to help them generate revenue from advertising,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, deputy managing director of <LOCATION> Saatchi </LOCATION>. `` We'll be saying to them: ` These are the advertising agencies around the world that you will need to talk to; these are the big advertisers around the world who are likely to be spending money on Soviet television.''' Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, Soviet television has experimented with commercials for Western products. Images of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> dancing to rock music in a <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> commercial flickered across Soviet screens last year, and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> DHL </ORGANIZATION> courier service, <ORGANIZATION> Omega </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watches </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> clothing also have advertised there. Ms. <PERSON> Tarassova </PERSON> said to Soviet viewers, the Western TV ad `` is beautifully done, it's interesting in some sort of way, it presents a piece of foreign music.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said the consultancy agreement is open-ended. He refused to say how much the Soviets are paying for it but said <PERSON> Gostelradio </PERSON> could expect to take in millions of dollars in ad revenues within the next five years. He admitted that enticing Western companies to advertise in a country where their products are n't available will be difficult. `` In the short term,'' he said, `` you will tend to see the sorts of advertisements which are corporate in nature. They are simply establishing the name and reputation of the company against that time when they'll be in a position to be actively selling.'' Soviet TV broadcasts on two main channels, with regional channels in all the republics. The estimated audience is 180 million, with another 30 million viewers in East bloc countries. Reaching that audience, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said, will cost Western advertisers $ 17,500 to $ 35,000 per 30-second commercial. A comparable nationwide TV commercial in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a country of 56 million people, averages $ 52,500. Ms. <PERSON> Tarassova </PERSON> predicted Western commercials would have Soviet viewers glued to their sets. `` I think for the mass audience it's a kind of new and interesting thing to watch,'' she added. `` We would like to make our television more sophisticated, more interesting to the audience, not so very stiff and official.''

<TEXT>
 More than 1 million workers paralyzed the nation's largest cities Thursday with a 24-hour general strike over the socialist government's wage policies and its links to financial scandals. The walkout closed banks, stores and government offices and grounded Olympic Airways, the national carrier. Buses, trolleys and taxis stayed off the streets in the two largest cities, <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Salonica </LOCATION>. Hospitals staffed by skeleton crews accepted only emergency cases. `` What's been happening in our country recently ca n't leave us indifferent ... The workers' movement says no to it,'' <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopoulos </PERSON>, a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told about 20,000 strikers rallying in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. He said a plague of multimillion-dollar scandals that have implicated senior officials from Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> `` offends our dignity, our families, our stomachs and our intelligence. The latest scandal involves the sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by a state-owned operation, and another one revolves around the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> and its ousted chairman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>. Both conservative and Communist opposition parties have united in demanding <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s resignation and immediate elections. Thursday's protesters, including factory workers, teachers and white-collar employees, marched through downtown <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> shouting `` No to austerity! Yes to substantial pay increases!'' They were protesting the government's failure to index wages to inflation, which ran at 14 percent in 1988, the highest rate in the 12-nation European Economic Community. Many private sector workers also took part in the strike. A strike declaration handed to Labor Minister <PERSON> Giorgos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gennimatas </PERSON> also demanded that annual vacation leaves be increased from one month to five weeks and that the 40-hour work week be reduced by three hours. To curb an enormous public-sector deficit and 24 percent inflation, the government imposed nearly a total freeze on wages in October 1985. That program ended in December 1987, but real incomes had dropped an estimated 12 percent by then. The general walkout came a day after educators went on a nationwide strike to demand higher salaries and more government spending on education. Their three-day strike has locked more than 1.5 million students out of classrooms.

<HEAD>All Two-Door Cars Suffer Damage in 5 mph Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Every model of new two-door cars that was intentionally run into posts and barriers at 5 mph suffered at least several hundred dollars damage, with the worst repair estimate totaling $ 3,444, according to insurance industry tests released Thursday. Although some cars performed better than in similar tests a year ago, `` there is no reason why any car should be damaged at all,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said the low-speed tests were conducted over the past month at test facilities in <LOCATION> Hartwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, using 19 new 1989 cars purchased anonymously by the institute, which is financed by the insurance industry. Damage estimates were updated for 15 other cars where the model had not changed since identical 1988 tests. Repair estimates after four tests were over $ 3,000 for three cars: the <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> Impulse at $ 3,444, the <ORGANIZATION> Daihatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charade </ORGANIZATION> at $ 3,047 and the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> CRX HF at $ 3,040. The least-damaged cars were the Geo Spectrum with $ 434 damage, the Toyota Corolla with $ 495 and the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colt </ORGANIZATION> with $ 642. Each of 34 cars tested was run into a barrier both frontward and backward and also frontward into an angle barrier and backward into a pole, all at 5 mph. The most-costly damage in most cases was in the pole test where the impact was concentrated over a smaller area. The pole did $ 1,445 damage to the <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> model. Prior to the 1983 model year, federal law required that cars sustain no damage in 5 mph front and rear barrier tests. For newer models, the standard was lowered to 2.5 mph. Less than a third of the cars in the new tests sustained no damage at all in the front and rear barrier tests. In 1981 tests, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said, the Ford Escort suffered no damage in all four tests. In the new tests, a 1989 Ford Escort LX had no damage in the front and rear barrier tests but the institute estimated repairs costing $ 1,481 to the 1989 model after the pole and angle crashes. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said the difference is due to changes in the model that include a lightweight bumper to help <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> meet federally imposed mileage standards. She said the pole and angle tests are `` very tough'' but all of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s cars voluntarily comply with the pre-1983 standard for straight-on barrier crashes rather than the less-stringent 2.5 mph standard. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON>, said he could not comment on the results because he had not seen the documentation from the tests but he noted that another Isuzu-produced car, the Geo Spectrum, suffered the least-costly damage in the tests. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonius </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the CRX HF model is designed for fuel economy with a lighter bumper but other <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> models have stronger bumpers than last year. `` The most important thing is that this is not related to auto safety,'' he said. The tests did not cover any injuries that might occur to driver or passengers in low-speed crashes. The institute said a basic <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CRX </ORGANIZATION> model, which was the worst affected in 1988 with $ 2,782 damage, sustained $ 2,061 in damage to the 1989 model. `` This improvement is encouraging,'' said <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, `` but there was still a lot of damage to the'89 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> CRX -RRB- and a very long way to go.'' The fourth most-damaged car, a Chrysler Conquest TSi, with a repair estimate totaling $ 2,357, required a new front fender at a cost of $ 300. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said the mass-produced sheet-metal fender costs as much as a washing machine which `` comes complete with motor, pump, hoses and circuitry as well as the metal housing.'' He said a similar fender for a 1989 Sundance, also a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> product, costs $ 92. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he had not seen the data from the institute and could not comment on the results without knowing more about criteria used for the tests and damage estimates. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said independent appraisers were used to assess damages. In the case of the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CRX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HF </ORGANIZATION> and 14 other cars, the estimates are based on 1989 repairs of cars damaged in 1988 tests because there was no change in the models, he said. None of the cars was repaired by the institute, but all were sold as damaged vehicles to ensure that they would not be passed along as new after repairs, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said.

 With proper precautions, pregnant women can travel to most places and undertake most activities they enjoyed before, short of extreme pursuits such as water skiing or high-altitude climbing, doctors say. `` There's a real feeling out there that women should try to be as active as they can ... during pregnancy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bia </PERSON>, co-author of newly compiled medical guidelines for pregnant women who travel. Pregnant travelers are no longer just businesswomen stepping onto domestic airplanes, but increasingly are adventure travelers or career women sent to Third World countries by government or humanitarian agencies, said <ORGANIZATION> Bia </ORGANIZATION>, co-director of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traveler </ORGANIZATION>'s Clinic in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` There are so many volunteer agencies where you're committed to a year or two, and people are starting their families in the middle of central <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said in a telephone interview Wednesday The guidelines devised by <PERSON> Bia </PERSON> and the clinic's co-director, Dr. <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, are published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. They cover five major areas: commercial flying; exercise and trekking at high altitudes; traveler's diarrhea; immunizations; and malaria. `` It's quite complete and up to date. It is a good review,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Klapholz </PERSON>, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klapholz </PERSON> said he believes most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> women now travel at some time during their pregnancies. Those going abroad should remember that comparable levels of medical care are often unavailable outside Western nations, he said Thursday. Prematurity, surgery, blood transfusion and other medical problems and procedures that are easily handled here often carry graver risks elsewhere, <PERSON> Klapholz </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines now permit pregnant women to fly up until their 36th week of gestation _ about four weeks short of term _ while foreign airlines usually make the cutoff 35 weeks, <ORGANIZATION> Bia </ORGANIZATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> wrote. Most aspects of flying are entirely safe for normal pregnant women and their fetuses, including airport metal detectors in airports, they said. The same is not true for strenuous vacations at high altitudes, the doctors wrote. While rigorous exercise need not be curtailed during pregnancy, treks above 7,000 feet should probably be avoided, they wrote. They also recommended against water skiing or scuba diving below 60 feet because of the possibility of injury to the fetus. <PERSON> Klapholz </PERSON> added snow skiing to the list, noting it is a sport requiring a high degree of balance, which is thrown off by the physical changes pregnancy brings. On the topic of traveler's diarrhea, the guidelines said pregnant women must be `` fastidious'' about avoiding contaminated food and water, but should not use iodides for long-term water purification because of the possibility they could cause an enlarged thyroid gland in the fetus. Additionally, women should avoid the popular diarrhea remedy subsalicylate bismuth, sold under the Pepto-Bismol brand name, <PERSON> Bia </PERSON> said. Its salicylate component could cause fetal bleeding, and bismuth, a heavy metal, has been linked to fetal malformations in sheep, he said. Immunizations should be avoided during pregnancy if possible. If deemed necessary, immunizations should not use live vaccine or cause fever, the guidelines said. With a live vaccine, virus can infect the fetus, while fever has been associated with spontaneous abortions, they said. As for malaria, for which no vaccine exists, the best strategy is to try to protect against mosquito bites that transmit the disease and to take the preventive drug chloroquine, which has proven safe for pregnant women, the guidelines say.

 More than 1,000 workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday protested their leadership's failure to nominate human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> to a new national legislature. `` Resign! Resign!'' the crowd chanted when one speaker read a banner that demanded the prestigious academy's ruling Presidum step down. Other protesters held handwritten banners reading: `` Down with Academic ` democracy'!'' `` Sakharov _ Yes!'' and `` Who if not <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>?'' The academy workers, ranging from prominent intellectuals to members of informal political groups, massed outside the organization's headquarters in damp weather to hear a dozen speakers. `` We have a fundamental crisis in the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. A crisis of mistrust of the wide masses in Soviet science related to ecological problems, the Chernobyl catastrophe and many other circumstances,'' declared <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukhin </PERSON>, a laboratory head at the academy's <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> listened to the speeches at the base of the steps, applauding speakers but not taking the floor himself. The academy's Presidium voted Jan. 18 on nominations for deputies to the new 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a parliamentary body that will be elected in March and will in turn choose a full-time legislature and president. The parliament will have representatives from professional, political and social organizations as well as from localities. The Presidium rejected the nominations of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 67, a nuclear physicist and dean of the Soviet human rights movement; space scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON>; and other prominent intellectuals. <PERSON> Mukhin </PERSON>, speaking from the steps of the group's neo-classical headquarters, said the rejections have eroded the prestige of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has been nominated to represent a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> district, but many of his scientific colleagues wanted him chosen to represent them in the academy. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> complained Wednesday in the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> that the nominating process in the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> was working well at the lower level. But he said that when the leadership made its final picks, only top administrators were picked. He charged the leadership failed to fulfill its legal obligations and ignored the popular will in selecting its candidates. Similar complaints were voiced at Thursday's demonstration. One banner poked fun at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, which on Wednesday published an article saying the meeting at which <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was defeated `` was not only fully democratic but benevolent.'' The name of the newspaper means truth, and one banner declared: `` Pravda is Half-Truth.'' The crowd heckled an academy vice president, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudryavtsev </PERSON>, who defended the selection of deputy nominees and promised that alternative views would be considered at a later stage in the election process. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, quoted academy President <PERSON> Guri </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchuk </PERSON> as saying the protesters' complaints will be considered at a meeting of the academy's Presidium on Tuesday. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting it showed that opposition had a voice in President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program for perestroika, or restructuring. `` I consider this is an important event on the road to our perestroika,'' said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. `` The scientific society has had its say. I think it -LRB- the meeting -RRB- will play a great role in the history of Soviet science.'' The demonstrators approved resolutions criticizing the candidates put forward by the Presidium, asking them to withdraw from the elections and proposing creation of a new scientific group independent of the academy.

<HEAD>Party Leadership Still At Odds After 3-Day Meeting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A three-day meeting of the divided <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership produced no plan for solving <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic and political crisis despite warnings from the military that it might step in Among the most serious problems are annual inflation approaching 300 percent, a $ 21 billion foreign debt, unemployment of 17 percent and a living standard that has been cut in half since President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> died in 1980. Agreement was reached on only one issue at the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, which ended Wednesday night: to convene a special party congress this year in an attempt to break the political deadlock. Twenty senior officials resigned their party posts or were replaced, including a former party president and three members of the country's nine-member collective presidency. The main conflict is between factions who want more political pluralism and democracy and those who favor increased central party control. `` We are divided on fundamental questions,'' committee member <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrhovec </PERSON> said during the meeting. `` We have two different, clearly ideologically defined parties.'' An editorial in the daily <PERSON> Slobodna </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalmacija </PERSON> said: `` The main feature of the session, which initially promised ` a definite showdown' but brought just several ` skirmishes,' was a huge number of endless descriptions of the already well-known circumstances and causes of the crisis. `` All Yugoslavs find themselves with a contradictory feeling: On the one hand we want a final solution to the crisis ... while on the other we fear such a solution would never occur without a drama.'' The military, which traditionally sits out political argument, indicated with unusual bluntness it may take a hand if the leadership rift deepens. `` What some describe as the battle for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> will not be waged without the Yugoslav army,'' said Adm. <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Simic </PERSON>, chief political officer of the armed forces. He and Vice Adm. <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Brovet </PERSON> appealed for unity, urgent market-oriented reforms and more tolerance and democracy. <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, the party chairman, told the meeting a political climate should be created for `` the reforms necessary to overcome the difficult situation in the country and to enable the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to stop losing battle after battle.'' Party membership in the ethnically diverse federation of six republics has declined nearly 10 percent since 1981 to fewer than 2 million of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 24 million people. <PERSON> Slobodna </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalmacija </PERSON> said no solution to the country's problems is possible while each republic has its own independent <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Among those whose resignations from party posts were accepted were <PERSON> Vidoje </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarkovic </PERSON>, former national party chief, and the three members of the collective presidency: <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sinan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hasani </PERSON> continue as members of the presidency, but a new policy does not allow an official to hold jobs in both the national government and party. <PERSON> Zarkovic </PERSON>, a close associate of Tito, resigned in response to demands made during huge demonstrations last month in his home republic of <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION> that led to replacement of the <LOCATION> Montenegrin </LOCATION> leadership.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared himself `` totally recovered'' Thursday after a week-long bout with a cold and laryngitis as well as a previously undisclosed ear infection that required him to take antibiotics. Pausing outside the Oval Office with visiting Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'll make a health statement: I'm a totally new man. All well. Totally recovered.'' His voice was much stronger and he had color in his cheeks. On Wednesday <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> canceled a speech because of his voice, which had been extremely raspy a day earlier. The White House had acknowledged earlier that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was taking a decongestant and an aspirin substitute. Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also had taken penicillin `` earlier in the week for an ear infection associated with the cold, but that has been stopped and he is no longer on any medication at all.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there had not been an attempt to withhold information about the ear infection and antibiotic treatment, though reporters had asked repeatedly during the week about the medication <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was receiving. `` It just was n't researched as thoroughly as it should have been,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We did n't do it right the first time, that's all.'' The press spokesman said he did not know if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had had any fever during the week. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s prognosis was `` excellent. He's in good shape. His voice is getting stronger. He feels well.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably would `` take it easy a little bit in terms of his speaking'' on Friday `` and then he's got the weekend to relax so he'll be fit as a fiddle for the big speech on Thursday night'' when he addresses a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his proposals for the budget. The president will spend the weekend at Camp David, leaving the White House on Friday evening and returning Sunday night, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably would have some guests at the retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Catoctin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. Asked for assurances that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not leave the presidential compound over the weekend, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` As far as I know he plans to stay on Camp David, but then there are no guarantees.''

 <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> will get a $ 58 million loan to fight locusts that are threatening to destroy over 190 million acres of crops on land that has helped feed the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> area for more than 2,000 years, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. In ancient times, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was the breadbasket of the Roman empire. Now the swarms of locusts could destroy the livelihood of 12 million people. The loan will go to help a $ 112 million project for buying trucks and equipment and spraying 15 million acres over two years. That is the expected duration of the locust plague that began in the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauretania </LOCATION> in 1985 and has since swept across the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> to the north. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which has 151 member countries, is the biggest source of aid money to the Third World. It will make this loan for 15 years. including a five year grace period. During that period only interest will be payable at a variable rate beginning at 7.65 percent a year. At the same time, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 33.9 million loan to help increase production at oil wells owned by the Algerian government.

<TEXT>
 Noise from Minneapolis-St. <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> has not reduced the market value of three homes that sit beneath the flight path of one of the airport's two busiest runways, a jury ruled The homeowners had sued the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to recover about $ 10,000 per home. `` These people are just ordinary citizens who fought their best fight against an awesome industry,'' an attorney for the plaintiffs, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, said after the <ORGANIZATION> Hennepin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury's decision Wednesday The verdict frees the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from liability for the effect of airplane noise on the homes, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, staff attorney for the commission. Jurors said they sympathized with the homeowners. But to have issued a verdict in their favor, the law required them to find that the homeowners' property had been `` taken, destroyed or damaged for public use without just compensation.'' The homeowners, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ario </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, argued that noise from the airport has gradually increased, eroding the value of their homes. They live in an upper-middle class area of older homes in the south part of the city. <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said he wanted to win the case to make the <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> more aware of homeowners' rights and encourage moving the airport to a new location. `` If they had to pay us, it might set a precedent for other property owners in the area,'' he said. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, another of the homeowners' attorneys, said they probably will ask for a new trial. `` The verdict indicates that there is not a serious noise problem in that area of the city, and the one thing that everyone from both sides agreed on is that there is a serious noise problem in that area,'' he said. As part of its defense, the <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> cited a $ 125,000 appraisal report that found no evidence that airplane noise had diminished the values of the three homes. Commission attorneys argued that demand for homes in the area remains strong and demand is what holds up prices. He also noted that the area is tops in the city in terms of how quickly homes put on the market are sold.

 Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, saying the American family has changed since the `` <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON>'' era, reintroduced legislation Thursday to require certain employers to provide unpaid leave to parents of newborn or seriously ill children. The <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> Democrat was joined at a news conference by several of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> allies who helped him push the legislation last year, when it reached the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor only to expire in the face of an undeclared filibuster. Among them was Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that is expected to turn to the Dodd measure by mid-March after first dealing with a proposed increase in the minimum wage <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> noted that the bill has the backing of such diverse groups as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leagues </ORGANIZATION>. `` Like us, they see the American family changing right before our eyes,'' said <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> and June and <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> have been replaced by <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> and My Two Dads.'' He said only one in 10 American families fit the `` <PERSON> Ozzie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON>'' or `` Leave It To Beaver'' role in which the father works and the mother stays at home. Moreover, he said, projections are that by 1995 two-thirds of all preschool children will have mothers who work full time outside the home. Immediately after the news conference, <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> convened the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on children, family, drugs and alcoholism, which he heads, for a hearing _ the only one planned on the bill this year _ to give proponents and opponents an opportunity to restate the positions they staked out during protracted proceedings last year. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> released a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study in conjunction with the hearing that said the measure, which applies only to companies with 20 or more employees, would cover about 12 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses and 47 percent of the work force. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, estimated the bill would cost covered businesses $ 236 million a year, all of it in the cost of continuing to provide health insurance for employees while they are on leave. There would be no cost to the government. The measure would require covered businesses to provide 10 weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child or for the serious illness of a child or elderly parent. It also would require 13 weeks of unpaid leave for an employee unable to work because of his or her own serious illness.

 In the wake of a measles outbreak among young children in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, federal health researchers said Thursday that intensive efforts are needed to better vaccinate preschoolers if the disease is ever to be wiped out. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last year reported 513 measles cases, 18 percent of the nation's total of 2,933, according to the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Of the surveyed cases for which ages were known, 26 percent, or 93 out of 353, were 16 months to 4 years _ old enough to be vaccinated, but not old enough to fall under mandatory school immunization rules. And of those 93 cases, 86 percent were considered `` preventable,'' meaning the children had not been vaccinated. The remaining 14 percent were cases where children were vaccinated but got the measles anyway. `` The routine age for vaccination is 15 months, but in most states where vaccinations are required for school, you've got that 4 -LCB- - year period where they are not ... required to have measles immunization,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measles specialist That age group has been a focal point for recent measles outbreaks in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and other places, <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON> said. `` That's why this -LRB- report -RRB- is focusing on that age group. They're not real easy to get at. In the late 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measles specialists believed the childhood disease could be eradicated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by fall 1982. But that goal was not met; in the past six years, between 1,497 and 6,282 cases have been reported each year. Part of the problem is what researchers call `` non-preventable'' cases _ those patients who were vaccinated but still got measles, since, at best, one in 20 vaccinations does not provide full immunity. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> study, 58 percent overall were considered non-preventable, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Researchers disagree on whether widespread vaccination of all age groups can ever, in theory, provide the `` herd immunity'' needed to completely cut off the spread of measles among the `` susceptibles'' whose vaccines did not work. `` Measles is very efficient at picking off susceptibles,'' <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON> said. But as long as large numbers of preschoolers remain unvaccinated, spreading the disease, there is no way to talk about complete eradication, he added. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> outbreak, `` the large percentage ... of vaccine-eligible patients 16 months to 4 years of age who were unvaccinated demonstrates the need for intensive efforts to increase vaccine coverage in this hard-to-reach group,'' the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> concluded in its weekly report. Many of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> cases occurred in Hispanic children from lower-economic areas, where the quality and availability of medical care may not be as high, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Long-term outreach programs are needed for parents and children in low socioeconomic groups in urban areas,'' the agency added. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommended removal of obstacles to immunizations by extending clinic hours, collaborations between health officials and community leaders to promote vaccination, and consideration of community locations for use as temporary vaccination sites.

<HEAD>Yeutter Questioned Closely in Ag Confirmation Hearing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary-designate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Thursday at his confirmation hearing that as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> he did n't know problems in futures trading were leading to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` Some complaints surface almost every week of the year and they are brought before a disciplinary committee,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most are fruitless. Some have validity and sanctions are applied upon those against whom charges are levied. `` I was not aware this was a widespread problem,'' he said. He said he did n't know of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sting operation, nor was he ever approached by the agency while he was president of the exchange. During a two-year undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation, which began in the last year of <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s tenure and became public last month, federal agents infiltrated the exchange to gather information about alleged fraud by brokers. `` I know no more than what is in the newspapers,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said of the case. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was president of the exchange from 1978 to 1985 when he left to become <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative. As he was leaving the trade representative job, he was honored with a reception Jan. 18 given by the food, tobacco and brewing conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to thank him for his aggressive pursuit of foreign markets for tobacco and other products. Rules of the executive branch forbid officals from accepting anything of value from those who could be affected by the official's action As agriculture secretary, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> would oversee the department whose policies directly affect <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. The reception was reported Thursday by The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., questioned <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> about a possible conflict of interest `` When <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> suggested that they would like to hold some kind of event in my honor because of all the work we had been doing in the international trade arena ... I could see no conflict of interest problems in them doing so because I was fully intending to go back to the private sector,'' said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. `` When the event was agreed to, it simply did not ring any conflict of interest bells,'' he said, noting that it was held near the end of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term. `` You are not going to be causing any conflicts of interest in the final 24 hours of an administration.'' He said President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked him to be agriculture secretary after he accepted <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' invitation. `` We probably should have reconsidered because of my expected continuation in government,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Frankly, I just did n't think about it We were so busy ... wrapping up all the trade problems at <ORGANIZATION> USTR </ORGANIZATION> and getting ready for the transition into <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, it totally disappeared from my attention screen.'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> whether receiving over $ 500,000 in deferred payments from the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while he was a government official could be construed as a conflict of interest. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the payments were made under a traditional deferred compensation program and distributed to him in a form advised by his tax counsel. Despite the pointed questions, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was praised by members of the committee and is expected to be confirmed without difficulty. The committee will meet early next week to vote on approval with confirmation by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> expected shortly thereafter. As for his new job, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> emphasized throughout the hearing what he said was the importance of holding down federal spending in agriculture and finding more foreign markets for American products. `` We have to find ways to permit American farmers to earn income from the marketplace and depend less on the federal government,'' he said. `` We have had too high a reliance on government by farmers in this country.'' Other topics on which senators asked <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s opinion and his responses were: _ School lunches: `` What will happen if the subsidy is withdrawn That is a policy I will have to take another look at.'' _ Farm Credit: `` If we do our jobs well and the farm economy does as well as it did this year in the future, then the situation will not get out of hand. _ General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-: `` We are not about to abandon any import constraints in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unless there is quid pro quo in other countries, giving us export opportunities It's a horse trade.'' _ Rural Development: `` The push and initiative should come from local areas We can help coordinate and provide technical assistance.'' He said the federal government does not have billions of dollars to put into helping farm communities diversify. _ Subsidies: `` We have to know what the trade-offs are I never said we should do away with -LRB- all -RRB- subsidies, only with trade limiting subsidies.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s surrogate militia expelled four Lebanese from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> `` security zone'' north of the border Thursday and killed three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas, police reported. A police spokesman identified one of those deported as <PERSON> Yahya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> of Shibaa, an educator attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The names of the other three men, also from Shibaa, were not available. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it would lodge a formal complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> about deportations from the zone just inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said to number 80 in the past month. Most of those deported allegedly refused to cooperate with Israeli-sponsored administrations in their villages or defied orders to join the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia that helps <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> patrol the zone. Members of the militia ambushed and killed three Palestinian guerrillas during the night near <LOCATION> Srobbine </LOCATION> village five miles north of the border, a security source said. No militia casualties were reported, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not clear whether the guerrillas were headed for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or planned an attack within the security zone. Also in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> evacuated nine seriously wounded Shiite Moslem militiamen of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, from the village of <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>. Reporters said the body of a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighter also was taken from <LOCATION> Jbaa </LOCATION>, which was caught between warring <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militias and the Israeli-patrolled zone. About 500 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> fighters were trapped in the mountain village three weeks ago after the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia drove them from surrounding areas. Four days ago <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, mediated by their sponsors <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, to end a 9-month-old war in which more than 600 people have been killed. Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinet, returned Thursday from three days of talks with an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> that failed to reconcile the rival Christian and Moslem governments. He made no statement. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, head of the predominantly Moslem cabinet, and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to meet with Lebanese leaders living in self-imposed exile. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s constitutional crisis began in September when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> could not agree on a successor to outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>.

 Selection of a jury pool for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial reached the halfway point Thursday, with the judge predicting the effort will take most of next week, too He also declared heatedly he wo n't allow `` security gurus'' to interrupt the trial once it starts. As a `` housekeeping matter,'' chief trial prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> he had been asked whether four courtroom seats could be made available on a rotating basis to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, the Justice, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and State Departments and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> reacted angrily. Getting the seats would be no problem, he said, but he added: `` I'm very concerned about their function. I do not intend to have this case run by two or three security gurus sitting in the audience. I do n't want to be in a position where every time a document flashes by you go to these people who check with their department.'' <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> said he was only carrying a message. And he added, `` In some ways the best thing for the trial is to let them see what is happening.'' He said, `` I do not think it is their intention to interfere with the trial.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he would make the seats available, but that he would work out ground rules for the agency representatives in private with the lawyers in the case. By the end of the third day of selecting a pool of 50 potential jurors, 18 women and 7 men had been qualified after painstaking, often solicitous questioning by the judge and the lawyers in the celebrated case. Among those chosen for the final cut were a woman who said she only likes reading the horoscope and the comics, a woman who heard something about shredding documents just before she turned off her TV set and an unemployed office manager who heard North `` was charged with selling something to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but that did n't interest me very much.'' One of those selected was a government heating mechanic working for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> who had difficulty recognizing North in the courtroom. `` I'm not sure if it's that guy who's constantly blinking. ... He is just constantly winking,'' the prospective juror said when asked by prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> whether he saw North in the courtroom. North, sitting across from the man on the other side of the room, gave him a thumbs-up sign. `` I just do n't want to be here,'' said one woman who works as a staff assistant for the city government. `` I had that experience before on jury duty and I just do n't like it.'' It turned out she was one of three people accepted in the morning session. The others were a woman who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for 21 years and a clerk typist at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, and chief trial prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> took turns at questioning prospective jurors who had said on a written questionnaire that they had not watched, listened to or read accounts of the Iran-Contra case. Repeatedly, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> would ask whether just after the July 4 weekend in 1987 they remembered seeing North `` testifying in his Marine uniform'' before the joint congressional committees investigating the affair. `` He testified for six days in uniform, the TV was full of it,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told a government contract specialist. She replied that she often watched a muted television set while listening to the radio. Judge and lawyers took pains to put the prospective jurors at ease, commiserating with them about having to sit alone and answer personal questions. Individual questioning sometimes took a half hour. Throughout, <PERSON> North </PERSON> sat at the defense table, flanked by two of his three lawyers. He appeared to pay rapt attention to the selection process. Now a civilian, the former lieutenant colonel wore a dark blue suit and subdued tie. Prospective jurors have been instructed not to read, watch or listen to anything about the case. The former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee, now a secretary, said she `` did n't even turn the television'' on when she went home Wednesday night `` because if I had I would have had to tell a lie. I do n't want to go to jail.'' She recalled hearing North's name mentioned earlier on television, but not seeing him. Her knowledge of the case came from her husband who thought <PERSON> North </PERSON> was `` somehow messing up.'' She said she thought <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities involved `` something about weapons ... selling weapons to the overseas people.'' The court is looking for jurors who were largely unexposed to North's testimony which dominated the nation's televison in mid-1987. In his six days' apperance, the fired <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide discussed many activities for which he now faces criminal charges. North was granted immunity from being prosecuted on the basis of that testimony and his lawyers say their client's rights against self-incrimination would be jeopardized if jurors' deliberations were colored by what they heard then. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was required to gather information for the criminal charges independently. North is accused of 12 crimes, including lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and lying to the attorney general about the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s role in diverting money from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Contras. He also is accused of illegally accepting a $ 13,800 security system at his home from co-defendant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, converting to his own use at least $ 4,300 in traveler's checks from <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and conspiring to defraud the government of tax revenue by using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the Contras.

<TEXT>
 About 120 <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> passengers, fed up with the shoddy service of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s only airline, refused for hours to leave a plane that landed before reaching their destination, a newspaper reported Thursday. The passengers of Flight 357 from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Naberezhnye </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelny </PERSON> waited overnight in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> airport last week for the weather o clear up so they could take off, the labor newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> said. The plane finally took off at 8:07 a.m. Jan. 24, but it landed before reaching <PERSON> Naberezhnye </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelny </PERSON>, a town 500 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the Tatar republic. The town formerly was called <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, after late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. The plane was held over, again because of poor weather, in <LOCATION> Kazan </LOCATION>, about three hours by car from Naberezhnye Chelny. The passengers were asked to get out and wait for another plane, but they refused, Trud said. They demanded that <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> provide a bus to take them to their destination and that the airline refund part of the cost of their tickets, the newspaper said. After much persuasion, airline officals were able to coax the women and children off the plane, but 33 of the most stubborn passengers held out for five hours. Even the chairman of the republic did his best to get the passengers off, but they did not agree to disembark until the airline gave in to their demands, <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> is the butt of jokes and ridicule in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its poor service and delays, but since it is the only carrier that makes domestic flights, Soviets have no choice. On one recent flight, six <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> passengers had to stand throughout the trip because the flight had been overbooked.

<TEXT>
 Negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations on manpower cuts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> concluded on Thursday after more than 15 years of inconclusive bickering. Spokesmen for both military blocs underscored the positive aspects of the talks, which comprised the first multilateral arms reduction forum in postwar <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But negotiators even had trouble agreeing on a name for the marathon parley, and the East rejected to the end the Western name of Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks. The sides halted their efforts after they agreed in a separate round of preparatory talks to begin the new Negotiations on Conventional Armed Forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on March 6. What the two sides did agree on was a joint dark blue tie, with yellow symbols on a blue background symbolizing a sword being beaten into a plowshare. The new talks, unlike the now-concluded conference that began in October 1973, will involve all 23 member countries of the two alliances and cover all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the Urals.'' The direct participants in the talks now concluded were East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> did not take part. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations failed because the two sides could not concur on mutual troop strengths and methods to police an eventual withdrawal. The sides released a brief joint communique that said, `` The extent of common ground has proved to be insufficient to enable the participants to agree on a treaty. `` Nevertheless, the positions of the two sides have converged on a number of issues. The participants have gained valuable experience and a clearer picture of what will be necessary to achieve mutually agreeable and verifiable reductions and limitations of forces and armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. The alliances refrained from the accusations characteristic of earlier stages of the negotiations. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Valerian </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said `` a formidable amount of useful work'' had been done but that `` the possibilities to overcome'' differences `` seem to be exhausted.'' He hailed Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s announcement to withdraw 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by the end of 1990 and plans for reducing armies in several <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries. This `` unilateral major reduction,'' <PERSON> Mikhailov </PERSON> said, `` mostly supercedes the very subject matter of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations, which proved to be unjustifiably narrow, and creates favorable prospects for forthcoming negotiations ...'' <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Veenendaal </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> ambassador speaking for the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> alliance, said that the two sides had gathered `` a wealth of experience and deeper insight in the complex issues of conventional arms control.'' He said the blocs had reached `` a large measure of agreement'' on `` general aims and principles,'' such as `` the aim of increased stability at lower levels of forces, the commitment to limit forces after reductions.'' <PERSON> Veenendaal </PERSON> said some Western concepts had become `` common ground during the negotiations.'' He cited as examples `` the concepts of parity expressed in common ceilings, collectivity, strict and effective verification and the need to solve the problem of asymetries.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials on Monday denied <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> claims that the Western alliance maintains roughly the same number of conventional forces in its European arsenal. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> wants the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc to make make greater reductions in their forces to bring the two sides to rough equality.

 A convicted <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> official told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that his friend and associate, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-designate <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, never tried to improperly influence him, the official's lawyer said Thursday. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON>, a suspended <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, commissioner, was asked about his relationship with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> in a half-hour meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week. The interview took place at the federal prison where Eaves is serving a six-year sentence for extortion, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, paid Eaves more than $ 34,000 as a lecturer over four years while <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> used his seat on the county commission to support measures that benefited the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> school. As <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> recounted Eaves' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> interview, `` He said that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> never sought to influence any of the decisions he had to make as a commissioner, either as a result of his friendship or any other position he might have had with <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` They did probe whether he -LRB- Eaves -RRB- had negotiated his position with the school through <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> directly, and he said he had not,'' <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> said. Eaves also said that `` he was not sure whether <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was aware'' of his position with the school and that the two `` never had any conversations regarding his -LRB- Eaves' -RRB- position with <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>,'' the lawyer said. <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> he has known <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> `` for some time,'' the lawyer said. The two knew each other while undergraduates at <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The White House, meanwhile, said it was working on a request by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> that he be allowed to maintain a relationship with the medical school he founded, possibly through a paid sabbatical. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the request `` unusual,'' but <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the office foresees no problems with that issue or with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s finances. `` He and his attorneys were in here a week ago to discuss his forms and there were just a couple of matters that came up,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` It's simply a matter now of getting the forms written down, because all the problems have been worked out.'' A government source familiar with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s situation said the nominee had a specific written contract entitling him to certain payments for a leave of absence. Because the contract is so precise and was written `` quite some time'' before he was considered for a federal job, the source said, a federal law prohibiting anyone from supplementing the salary of a federal official would not apply. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s statement also indicated lawyers had found a way to avoid any conflicts between <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s new job and federal aid to <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, which in fiscal 1988 amounted to $ 5.8 million from the agency <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> will head. The White House earlier this week asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to postpone <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing, saying that the financial disclosure statements and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check were not completed. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had no comment. A <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> transition source said the holdup on the nominee's confirmation hearing may be because his nomination was one of the last announced and because he is from outside the government, an extensive background check is required `` This is a cover-your-behind town,'' the source said. An official at <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday he has been asked by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s connection to <LOCATION> Eaves </LOCATION>. `` They raised that among many, many issues,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the medical school. `` They talked to me about a range of issues about Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s fitness for the position -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary -RRB-, including that -LRB- Eaves -RRB- and many other things.'' He declined to identify the other issues. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said he did not know how often Eaves lectured at the school. Published reports said Eaves lectured only twice over four years. Eaves was convicted last May on extortion charges. He was found guilty of accepting $ 35,000 from an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in exchange for his vote on a zoning matter. He had been suspended from the commission when he was indicted in October 1987. He was sentenced to six years in prison and fined $ 25,000. He is confined at the federal prison at <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, while he appeals his case, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> said. One of the proposals Eaves pushed as a commissioner was to increase <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>'s participation at <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He wanted the county hospital authority to allow <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> to provide more patient care at <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>. J.W. <PERSON> Pinkston </PERSON>, executive director of <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, said that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had contacted him and that other hospital administrators in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> region have told him they also had been questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in a background check on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` It was the usual inquiry. They did not ask for any documents but asked routine questions, which were very appropriate,'' <PERSON> Pinkston </PERSON> said. He declined to say what the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wanted to know.

<HEAD>Algeria Gets $58 Million to Fight Locusts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> will get a $ 58 million loan to fight locusts threatening to destroy more than 190 million acres of crops on land that has helped feed the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> area for more than 2,000 years, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. In ancient times, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was the breadbasket of the Roman empire. In <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> now the locusts could ruin the livelihood of 12 million people. Other countries in the area are cooperating in the fight against them. `` The plague could reach <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or even <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> if it is not controled in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hasso </PERSON> <PERSON> Molineus </PERSON>, who deals with <LOCATION> Euorpe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at the bank. The loan will go to help pay for a $ 112 million project for buying trucks and equipment and for spraying more than 15 million acres over two years in central and southern <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Planes, specially equipped trucks and portable knapsack sprayers will be used. Two years is the expected duration of the locust plague that began in the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauretania </LOCATION> in 1985 and has since swept across the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> to the north. But a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> paper that published his remarks added that the plague could go on for as long as 10 years. <PERSON> Molineus </PERSON> said that the locusts have also been around for thousands of years and the current plague is one of the worst in recent history.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> says he beat the odds in his murder and conspiracy trial and will win again in a retrial of those charges and in appeal of a 10-year prison term for a felony conviction. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> native and half-brother of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, faced the death penalty on charges he hired members of a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> street gang to murder a childhood friend and former employee who had harassed him. `` In an absolute sense, I'm not happy,'' he said in a telephone interview Wednesday night with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` In a relative sense I'm better off today than I was last week, and I thank God for that. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was freed from jail Monday on a $ 1.1 million bond. `` I could have been facing 85 years and the electric chair. Tonight, I'm in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with my family after being away almost six months, with the opportunity for another day to clear my name if the state decides to seek a retrial,'' said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, whose businesses include a chain of fast-food restaurants. A state <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> convicted <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> Saturday of accessory after the fact of assault and battery with intent to kill in connection with the attempted murder of <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> declared a mistrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict on the murder and conspiracy charges <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> faced in the death of <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> `` Hambone'' Barber and two other charges in the <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON> case. But he sentenced <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to the maximum prison term for the accessory felony conviction. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 45, was accused of hiring someone to kill Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON>, who witnessed the 1986 murder of Barber in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON> survived a stabbing attack. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said Wednesday he would not discuss details of the Barber case. A former employee of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> offered him $ 5,000 to kill Ms. <PERSON> Rosemond </PERSON> because she reportedly testified about <PERSON> Barber </PERSON>'s murder before a grand jury in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Solicitor <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> will make the decision on when to try <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> again on the murder charge. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> was out of town Thursday and would not return to his office until next week, his office said. One of <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Paschal </PERSON>, said the defense filed a notice of appeal Monday. `` I think there's no question that once we've been through this trial we're in a better position now that we know the accusations of the key witnesses,'' he said Thursday.

<TEXT>
 The administration said Thursday that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s status as chief foreign policy adviser to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not be affected by a revamping of operations in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` These changes are procedural and they were all worked out with Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and they do n't really reflect very much of a change _ they do n't reflect any change, actually, in terms of who's in and who's out and proportion of responsibility,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Under the plan, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, and his deputy, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, will serve as chairmen of two high-level groups that will meet on a daily basis to review national security and foreign policy issues, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The groups will replace the dozens of interagency groups set up during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to deal with specific problems. `` Essentially, it's just a different management style that they feel more comfortable with,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. On another point, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to hold down the membership of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. By law, its members include only the president, vice president, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> and secretary of defense. Frequently, however, presidents designate other people as members. `` I know the president does want to hold down the membership, just as he has in the Cabinet as well as in other areas,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> is not intended as a policy-making body although it has become that at times. Instead, it is designed to be an advisory panel for the president on national security policy.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Customs Halts Chemical Shipment To Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREMERHAVEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Customs officials stopped a shipment of chemicals bound for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to determine whether they could be used to produce explosives or poison gas, a <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION> newspaper reported Thursday. The Nordsee Zeitung said customs officials refused to authorize loading of the chemical hexamethylene tetramine for shipment to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, which has a chemical plant at <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says is capable of producing chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says it is a pharmaceutical plant. `` Customs officials stopped the shipment in connection with suspicions that West German firms may have been involved in the suspected Libyan poison gas factory,'' the newspaper said in a telex of its report to other news media late Thursday. It said the containers had proper loading papers and the contents corresponded to the shipping documents, but customs halted the shipment as a precaution to determine whether they required a government export license. The chemical can be used to make explosives as well as medicine and fertilizer, and also emits a toxic gas when ignited, the paper said. According to the Nordsee Zeitung, the shipment was from <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. It quoted company officials as saying the shipment did not require a government permit. `` We have been exporting this chemical for years to a Libyan fertilizer factory that uses it to enhance the effectiveness of natural wastes,'' the company was quoted as saying in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Degussa </ORGANIZATION>'s offices were closed Thursday night and company officials could not be reached by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. West German officials are investigating several companies in connection with the Libyan factory. On Wednesday, prosecutors investigating a West German company suspected of a central role in the plant's construction asked Swiss authorities for help in locating the firm's records. Prosecutors in <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION> asked Swiss officials for help in a search for <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen-Chemie </ORGANIZATION> company records, which news reports said were taken to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> several months ago. Imhausen-Chemie of <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> region is under criminal investigation to determine whether it violated export laws in with deliveries for the Libyan plant. Several other West German companies have acknowledged doing work for Imhausen-Chemie but deny knowing their equipment and blueprints were destined for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A 3-year-old boy torn from his mother and used as a human shield during a gang shootout is the latest casualty in a plague of innocent bystanders being drawn into the city's violence. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 3, was wounded while walking along with his mother in a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> housing project on Wednesday when he was thrust into the middle of what apparently was a drug-related dispute. After surgery <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> was in critical but stable condition, a hospital official said. Three young bystanders were killed in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> during the first three weeks of this year. Authorities say an increase in guns and the smokable cocaine derivative crack have made the streets more dangerous. `` Awful things have always happened, but not in the same numbers,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON>, a former assistant police chief in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, who recently retired as police chief in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` That someone would pick up a 3-year-old and use him as a shield is not surprising, not given the current conditions on the street,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reppetto </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, a private watchdog agency. `` You have a band of criminals out there who just do n't care who they hit,'' <PERSON> Reppetto </PERSON> added. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> does not keep statistics on the killing or wounding of innocent bystanders, said Assistant Chief <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. But in 1988, at least 18 innocent New Yorkers were killed by bullets intended for someone else, and at least 49 others were wounded, according to figures compiled by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The killings and woundings of bystanders is due to a change in traditional attitudes towards human life, the introduction of crack, and the wide availability of weapons, according to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a professor of criminology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Those factors, `` combined with drug markets in densely populated places, there's a high chance an innocent bystander will get hit,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> said. Drug gunmen on the street call the victims `` mushrooms'' _ people who pop up unexpectedly in the line of fire. The 3-year-old was walking alongside his mother, <PERSON> Modesta </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, who was pushing a younger son in a stroller at 12:35 p.m. when the shooting broke out. Two groups of teen-agers, handguns blazing, shot at each other as they ran through the housing project in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> section. One of the teens, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Casseus </PERSON>, 18, who was also struck by one of the bullets, was later arrested and charged with having used the toddler as a shield. Most of the incidents where innocents become victims occur in poor neighborhoods such as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and a disproportionate number of the victims are black or Hispanic. The traditional `` rules of the street,'' which frowned on the wounding or killing of bystanders, particularly women and children, `` is being stood on its head; the fact you challenge these traditional rules show what a hard man you are,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> added. `` Now, you have tremendously sophisticated weapons out there, you have drugs,'' <PERSON> Bouza </PERSON> said. `` If you look at the murder rate, it used to be people who knew each other, now strangers are killing each other.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Education Department officials said Thursday they have banned an Indianapolis-based trade school from participating in federal student aid programs for courses such as a truck-driving correspondence course. The non-appealable action against <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> came five months after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed a $ 366 million suit charging the school defrauded the aid programs. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, assistant education secretary for postsecondary education, said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> misrepresented its course offerings eight years ago when it applied to participate in federal student loan and grant programs. `` They are not now and have never been eligible,'' <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. He said the students did not get the training and service they signed up for. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said the school had pegged its tuition to the maximum available to students under federal aid programs and `` padded their courses'' in order to meet the required number of hours for truck-driving correspondence courses that had a short residential site training component. Depending on the type of aid, the courses are supposed to total 300 or 600 hours, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. `` The lessons would have had to average 10 hours apiece'' to qualify, he said. `` I did four of those lessons and in each case it took less than an hour.'' The Indianapolis-based Superior, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, operates a correspondence school in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and training sites in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The school also has branch campuses, not involved in student aid programs, in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Superior has enrolled close to 100,000 students since 1980 and receives virtually all of its revenues from tuition income, 95 percent of which is obtained by students through <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants and guaranteed student loans. <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphey </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the school is still eligible to participate in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial aid programs for the residential courses it offers. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Degler </PERSON>, director of advertising and public relations for Superior Training, said in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> that the affected correspondence course was a combination of home study and driver training and that the school's other courses were not affected by the suspension. `` Regardless of what the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> says, we're pursuing every legal avenue available to us to reverse this, primarily because due process was absent, because it is unfair to not just Superior, but to literally thousands of students that are currently studying with us and on behalf of the entire proprietary school industry,'' he said About 20,000 students a year take the correspondence course, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. Sample tasks in a lesson plan include calculating a car's gas mileage and making hotel reservations to visit the Superior school. Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said such a `` lesson plan'' was `` an insult to those in this country dedicated to training individuals to perform needed tasks.'' <PERSON> Degler </PERSON> said the school was talking with the department about extending the course to satisfy the department. He said the allegations about hotel reservations and gas mileage were `` ludicrous.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has been in business for 15 years, the last eight years we've been accredited by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. An increasing proportion of federal aid is going to the burgeoning number of proprietary or trade schools. For <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> grants the figure was 27 percent last year, and department officials have said they expect it to rise to 33 percent in the early 1990s.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, in his two years as speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has become accustomed to acting as a lightning rod for criticism. The storm over a proposed $ 45,500 congressional pay raise is subjecting him to his toughest test yet. This time, the current is being turned up by disc jockeys around the country giving out <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s phone number on the air, by opponents who have generated an outpouring of tea bags mailed to lawmakers and by editorial writers in <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s hometown who have excoriated the speaker. There even was a hunger strike aimed at <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> being staged on the Capitol steps by a local insurance salesman who said he is expressing the outrage of most Americans over the pay boost. `` They can justify it to themselves,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who said he had not eaten in five days. `` But the ones they have to justify it to are the people who are paying for it.'' The outpouring of public sentiment against the salary hike has forced <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, to back away from his original plan to let the full 50 percent increase go into effect without a vote. Senior House Democrats said that move was a sign of panic by the speaker and may have damaged his standing with colleagues. `` Members are turned off by the way he's handled it,'' said one, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. `` This has permanently hurt <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' But the speaker brushed it all off as routine. `` Taking the heat is part of the game plan around here,'' he said. `` It's somewhat continuous.'' First, in an apparent effort to spread the blame, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> sent out a questionnaire this week to colleagues asking whether they wanted to vote on the issue. Aides said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was tired of reading that he was imposing his will on <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who wanted to vote on the issue, when members were telling him otherwise in private. But the move was received coolly even by those on his own leadership team. `` I'm not dealing with the survey,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., when asked about it Then on Thursday, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he will ask lawmakers to vote next week on a package to pare back the pay raise to $ 26,850 and ban speaking fees and restrict other outside income. Many House colleagues were privately critical, saying it is <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s role as speaker to take the heat for colleagues on matters such as the pay raise, and that the new plan will leave them with no increase in pay. For lawmakers who now collect the maximum in speaking fees, the raise would be offset by the cut in honoraria income. The critics, members of both parties, all of whom declined to be quoted by name, complained that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had been unable to withstand the heat even though he is politically secure in his <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, congressional district and was unopposed in the last election. It remained unclear whether the resentment would be lasting, and whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s position would be weakened by the controversy. `` He's always had difficulty with this issue,'' said one Democratic leadership aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The reference was to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to decline a $ 12,100 pay raise in 1987 that was meaningless because <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> scheduled it the day after the raise took effect. But if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s strategy works, the aide said, all will be forgotten. `` Winning's the only defense,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, since he took the spaker's chair in 1987, has been almost constantly immersed in controversy. On his first day in the post he made comments advocating a tax increase that drew immediate fire. A few months later, he drew the ire of Republicans by holding open a budget vote tally until he could persuade a fellow Texan to change his vote and enable the Democrats to win. More recently, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been the subject of two separate ethics investigations _ one into whether he abused his office for financial gain, and another on whether he improperly disclosed a secret <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Both of those cases remain open. But the consensus on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> was that the pay raise issue had been hotter for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> than any of the previous controversies, and there were hints that it might persist well after next week's action `` I can assure you that a vote of the nature the speaker envisions wo n't be the last one on this issue in this Congress,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a leading pay raise opponent.

<HEAD>FCC Commissioner Says Rules Needed on Phone Companies, Cable TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said Thursday the government must establish rules to assure that a `` cornucopia'' of video, voice and data material will flow into American households over high-technology telephone lines. Though <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> expressed reservations about the ways telephone companies might compete in the cable television arena, she said it was time to end an era of `` television of scarcity'' in which a few companies offer a limited amount of programming. She said she looked forward to the day when Americans will have access to an unlimited number of two-way or `` interactive'' entertainment, educational and communications signals carried into their homes by lasers on telephone fiber optic cables. `` It is my job to think about what kind of networks we want for the future,'' she told a luncheon audience at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commmission </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` What kinds of demands are really ultimately going to be placed on a telephone network or cable system which starts providing two-way interactive -LRB- services -RRB-? And I do n't think that we can seriously say it's going to be plain ol' voice -LRB- telephones -RRB- any longer. She said regulations must be structured `` so that this cornucopia of services will blossom _ just not video programming and video on demand but interactive services for educational purposes, medical purposes.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> voted tentatively last year to seek public comment on a possible recommendation that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allow telephone companies to enter the cable TV business, repealing laws that ban such entry. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said it was important to make sure that telephone companies would not be able to use their enormous resources to squeeze cable operators out of the market, either through exclusive programming or by simply buying up the competition. Telephone companies should be required to build cable systems, and thus they would utilize the potential of fiber optics, she said. Also, if phone companies are allowed to provide their own programming, she said, they must be required to carry other companies' programs for reasonable fees. She advocated an approach in which cable programming `` stores'' would pay to have their products displayed in phone company `` shopping malls.'' `` We've got a store right now, and that store is operated by the cable company and they decide what products go in and where the shelf will be and who gets to be the providers of services within that store,'' she said. `` What I would like to see is just not another competing store with the telephone companies offering video services but perhaps a shopping mall opened up. That's what fiber really allows us to do because it has such high capacity. If the telephone companies come in as common carriers then lots of stores will be able to occupy space in that shopping mall and the consumer will be better off because then the consumer will have an abundance of choice,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. She said a major issue was whether or not the phone companies got to open their own `` store'' in the `` shopping mall'' and offer their products and programs over their telephone lines. She said if the phone companies operate the mall _ the phone lines _ `` and they've also got a store they might turn off the lights for everybody else and keep only their light on so that's the only one that the consumers would have access to.'' Another concern was cross-subsidization in which telephone companies would use telephone revenues to finance cable operations, or vice versa. She said telephone users should n't have to pay more. She said of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` If we can set the landscape and carefully structure it so that the twin evils of discrimination and cross-subsidization are avoided or are at least contained well, then they will listen. I ` m hopeful that we will get a very good reception.''

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was sworn in as president on Thursday and called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> achieve peace and economic stability. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 67, was inaugurated during ceremonies that drew hundreds of dignitaries, including Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> received the red, blue and yellow presidential sash from his predecessor, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>, who presided over the oil-exporting nation during a period that saw its standard of living drop with the plunge in petroleum prices. The five-year term is <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>' second. The constitution limits presidents to a single term, after which they must wait a decade before seeking re-election. Perez first took office in 1974, the year after the Arab oil embargo sent oil prices soaring. He nationalized <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s oil industry in 1976. In his speech, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> promised major economic reforms and pledged to work with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to seek peace in the region. `` The new <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government has the immense and challenging possibility of seeing -LRB- <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -RRB- as an area open to fruitful dialogue,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told the 2,000 world leaders, diplomats and politicians in his televised address. `` We hope to work together to contribute to a definitive solution to the problem of the -LRB- foreign -RRB- debt as well as a peaceful, respectful and promising solution for the Central American situation, the recovery of democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the normalization of inter-American relations.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> supports a peace pact adopted by the five Central American nations in August 1986 calling for democratization and an end to outside military aid. The plan has been hamstrung by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration support for <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels seeking to overthrow the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In meetings here this week, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> exchanged views on how to move forward with the plan through new proposals more acceptable to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. ` The possibility of a fruitful encounter between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be strengthened if we are recognized as solid friends rather than subordinates. I have expressed this to President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. The new president is also promoting a `` common framework'' for Latin countries to achieve easier terms to repay their $ 420 billion foreign debt, a major factor behind the region's economic troubles. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the fourth-largest Latin American debtor, recently suspended principal payments on much of its $ 32 billion foreign debt and is involved in talks with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to obtain billions of dollars of new loans. `` The responsibility for definitive solutions falls equally on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the other industrialized nations and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. He said his economic program, to be announced `` in the next few days,'' will include a currency devaluation, higher domestic interest rates, price increases and higher public service charges.

<TEXT>
 Police in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> have seized cocaine labs at a ranch with enough chemicals to produce 40,000 to 50,000 kilograms of cocaine, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The raids by the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> over the past few days netted 1,200 kilograms of cocaine base as well as thousands of gallons of chemicals needed to produce finished cocaine hydrochloride, but produced no arrests, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Deac </PERSON>. `` Usually, all you get at the labs are small fry, unless you get a chemist,'' <PERSON> Deac </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for operations, lauded the seizures. `` This may be as large or larger than the Tranquilandia site seized in 1984 and we are extremely pleased with the aggressive law enforcement action taken by our colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Westrate </PERSON> said. The raids targeted a ranch called the <ORGANIZATION> Finca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iglesias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vereda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Danta </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Antioquia </LOCATION>, which is 100 miles from <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the base of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe has been responsible for much of the cocaine brought into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Colombian <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> raided the 17 buildings at the ranch starting Jan. 28, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` These labs had n't yet gotten to the stage of actually producing cocaine,'' said <PERSON> Deac </PERSON>. In the March 1984 Tranquilandia raids, which <PERSON> Deac </PERSON> described as the record cocaine seizure in history, 22,000 pounds of cocaine were seized, including 18,700 pounds of pure cocaine hydrochloride, `` ready to be exported,'' and 3,300 pounds of cocaine base, he said.

<HEAD>Timothy Leary Unrepentant About Advocating Drug Use In 1960s</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A block from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION>, one of the university's most notorious former professors is the top act at a comedy club. But <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said Thursday his new career is simply an extension of his work in academia. His message, he said, is no different than it was in the 1960s, when he was known as an LSD guru: `` T.F.Y.Q.A. _ Think for yourself, question authority,'' said <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>. He added that he does not regret advocating drug use then and blames the government for the current drug crisis. `` I'm a performing philosopher,'' said <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> prior to his appearance at Catch a Rising Star. `` The performance I give at a club is no different from what I once said in class. Without getting heavy, comedy has taken over from rock' n' roll as the first line of dissent these days.'' But <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> does n't really call his act comedy; he terms it a `` lecture.'' That may be fortunate, since area newspapers almost universally panned his performances. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, however, said he is only concerned with making audiences think for themselves. `` I throw out an enormous amount of ideas,'' said <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>. `` I strafe and strobe the audience. I throw them curveballs, fastballs, I make them think.'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, 69, was fired from his job as a psychology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1963 after his drug experimentation. He now lives with his fifth wife in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and dabbles in educational computer software while making occasional forays on the comedy nightclub circuit to `` pay the bills.'' In his act, <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> tells the audience, `` I'm a little brain-damaged _ you know that.'' But he claims that, in reality, drug use has sharpened him. `` I'm much better at my job of being a performing philosopher,'' he said. `` I feel I have one of the most efficient minds on the planet. I see much more clearly.'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> maintains that he never advocated anything but the `` precise and proper'' use of recreational drugs for the purposes of mind expansion. `` If the government had followed my opinion not to have drugs something we should be persecuted for and instead use them as part of medical education we would not have a drug problem,'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said. `` We never talked about lumping LSD with cocaine.'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said he regrets that some LSD users committed suicide or harmed themselves. `` We were deeply concerned that even one person might have been hurt by self-medication,'' he said. But he believes the negative publicity about taking LSD and other hallucinogens in the 1960s overshadows what he considers a real tragedy. `` I have to look at the comparative statistics,'' he said. `` The real casualties in the'60s were the men who died in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and those who were psychologically crippled by the war. If you want to talk about flashbacks, the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> flashbacks -LRB- experienced by veterans -RRB- are 50,000 times worse.'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> no longer advocates using LSD since `` you can no longer get it pure,'' but said he still `` medicates myself'' if he feels like it. He said he and his second wife took the drug ecstasy a few days before their wedding. <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> said he is happy, though he is often broke and lives `` like a graduate student worrying about how to pay the rent.'' `` You may hate me ... but at least you always know where I stand,'' he said.

 A judge has ruled that a lesbian couple's dispute over custody of a child they raised together can proceed to trial, in a case that tests a mostly uncharted area of family law, a lawyer said `` At the heart of it are fundamental concepts of family, equality and the right of persons who are lesbian to have access to their children,'' attorney <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> said Wednesday. The lawsuit arises at a time when lesbian partners increasingly are arranging to have children, either by adoption or artificial insemination. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>'s client, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, is seeking legal joint custody of a 2-year-old girl who was born to <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON>'s then-partner The couple conceived the child through artificial insemination, using sperm donated by a relative of Ms. <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON>'s, Ms. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. When the couple broke up, the 29-year-old mother, who was not identified, allegedly began to restrict Ms. <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON>'s time with the girl and refused to permit Ms. <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON> to participate in parental decisions. Ms. <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON> sued on Nov. 29 to establish her rights as a parent. `` We asked the court to recognize that this was a family, although not a traditional one, and that it would be unfair to deprive our client of contact with the child,'' Ms. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> said. The mother's attorney, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, responded by seeking to dismiss the case in a legal motion known as a demurrer, which argues that the court has no legal authority to consider the claim. But on Monday, Superior Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denner </PERSON> overruled the defendant's motion, allowing the case to proceed to determine if Ms. <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON> has a legal right to joint legal and physical custody. No trial date has been scheduled. `` My client has no comment on the case,'' <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said after the decision. Ms. <PERSON> Sabol </PERSON> expressed relief at the ruling and said she had not had contact with the child for three months. `` There are literally thousands of people now in my situation ... but there are no laws protecting us,'' she said in a telephone interview. The court has sealed records in the case, according to a bailiff for <PERSON> Denner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Achtenberg </PERSON>, directing attorney of the Lesbian Rights Project in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said she was aware of a half-dozen similar cases in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in recent years, as well as a few in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. However, there is `` no controlling legal precedent'' because no case has ever reached appellate level, she said. To gain a court hearing, a parental custody claim typically must cite a recognized legal relationship to the child, usually by a dissolution of marriage or paternity claim, Ms. <PERSON> Achtenberg </PERSON> said. But neither claim is available to a lesbian parent. Without specific guidance from the legislature, said Ms. <PERSON> Achtenberg </PERSON>, `` The courts have gotten stuck over their authority to hear a claim by a person who is not related to the mother, and who is not related to the child.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Merger Delayed Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Thursday ordered a new delay in the imminent partial merger of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said the newspapers could not proceed with their planned combination of business and production departments, which was scheduled to occur Feb. 6. The delay was requested by opponents of the joint operating agreement. A three-judge panel of the appeals court last Friday rejected arguments by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Citizens </LOCATION> for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a 500-member consortium of newspaper advertisers and readers. The Newspaper Preservation Act requires one of the newspapers to be facing the likelihood of financial failure without combination with a healthier competitor. The consortium contended that former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had distorted the law in approving a partial exemption from federal antitrust laws for the newspapers last August. The court, in ordering the delay, did n't say when the merger could proceed, but said it must wait until there is a decision on opponents' request for a rehearing on the issue. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of The News, had no immediate comment on the court action, said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at company headquarters in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` This is surely a disappointment, but I hope only a temporary interruption toward assuring a future for this newspaper,'' <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said in a statement `` After almost three years, the way we have learned to survive is to be patient and to hope that finally what is right and justified _ the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> _ will occur,'' the statement said. The newspapers applied for the joint operating agreement 1986, saying the Free Press was in danger of closing without the merger. The two papers, the ninth - and 10th-largest in the nation, say they lost a combined total of $ 155.7 million between 1981 and 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has threatened to sell the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> if the merger is denied. Opponents contend <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> can support both newspapers, and asked the court to order a hearing by all 13 appeals judges because of the extraordinary legal issues raised in the case. They argue that the newspapers would suffer little harm as a result of the delay. In papers filed with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> court this week, the Free Press said the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> was ready to move ahead. `` It would be patently unfair to bring these activities to a halt because -LRB- opponents -RRB- cavalierly and belatedly seek a new hearing,'' the Free Press' attorneys said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state senator who spearheaded opposition to the partial merger, said Thursday afternoon from his Lansing office that the newspapers acted prematurely to combine their business operations. `` My reaction is that it's comparable to the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> confronting a small group of Afghan guerrillas. They had the firepower, they had the high tech and they were defeated once again,'' he said. `` They moved ahead without trying to think through the human consequences. For whatever trauma they've caused their own employees, they bear the guilt for,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities fear that a hunger strike by 38 jailed leftist terrorists could lead to a new wave of attacks, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office said Thursday. The hunger strike began Wednesday when 28 imprisoned members of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> refused to take food. Ten more imprisoned terrorists joined the action Thursday, spokesman <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. The hunger strikers, in 12 different prisons across the country, are demanding to be jailed together and other concessions. `` As you know, all previous hunger strikes were accompanied by terrorist acts,'' <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said when asked if authorities feared another wave of terrorist attacks by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers still at large. Prechtel spoke in a telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Karlsruhe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>, the country's most notorious terrorist group, has carried out numerous bomb attacks and assassinations targeted at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s business and government leaders. The hunger strike brought the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> group back into the headlines after a relative lull in terrorist actions in recent months. Some leftist politicians have begun a debate among West Germans by urging authorities to start a dialogue with the group in an attempt to get it to move away from terrorism. Several <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> members have been pardoned recently after renouncing terrorism. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said only three convicted members of the group who have distanced themselves from terrorism and who may come under consideration for a presidential pardon have not joined the strike. He said authorities have not determined what targets, if any, could be attacked by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> recalled that the start of the hunger strike coincided with the fourth anniversary of the slaying of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> by a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> commando. After <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>'s murder, 37 jailed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> terrorists announced they were giving up their 60-day hunger strike. That hunger strike was the longest of the nine similar actions carried out before the latest fast. Convicted terrorist <PERSON> Holger </PERSON> <PERSON> Meins </PERSON> died in 1974 after a hunger strike in prison, and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Sigurd </PERSON> <PERSON> Debus </PERSON> died in 1981 after a fast. The latest action appears to be designed to avoid deaths. According to a statement by a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> faction prisoner printed in a newspaper, the group will fast for two weeks. After that, the hunger strike will be continued by two members of the group rotating every two weeks. The letter, signed for the group by <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON>, said the jailed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> members were demanding to be imprisoned together in one or two groups. They are also demanding freedom for four jailed <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> members whose health the group claims has been damaged in prison. The group is also demanding `` free political communication'' with all social groups and unrestricted medical care outside police supervision. The statement signed by <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON>, who is serving a life sentence, was published in the leftist <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> newspaper TAZ. <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> was convicted in a 1981 car bombing at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION> that injured 18 people. Among those on the latest hunger strike are such notorious terrorists as <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohnhaupt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Giesela </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutzi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Sybille </PERSON> <PERSON> Haule-Frimpong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Klar </PERSON>. All are serving either life sentences or long prison terms after being convicted for murders, bomb attacks and other terrorist acts.

 Teachers are threatening to withhold grades to force resolution of a contract dispute, prompting hundreds of students to walk out of class Thursday as parents considered a lawsuit. The dispute between the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District's 32,000 teachers and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> also has led to talk of a strike The students walked out of classes at several high schools to support the teachers' wage demands and to demand that quarterly grades due Friday be reported on official district forms. Thousands of students have staged similar demonstrations since mid-January, although not all have been in support of the teachers and some apparently have been only a way to cut class. The teachers union, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, plans to have members give students their midterm grades on a union report card rather than officially report them to the district after exams Friday. District Superintendent <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> has threatened to withhold paychecks if the teachers hold back grade reports. One group of parents is exploring the possibility of suing the teachers or the district, or both, if grades are n't officially reported. The teachers, who have been without a contract since June 1988, have asked for a one-year pay raise of 12 percent; the district offered 17.4 percent over three years. During an unsuccessful bargaining session Sunday, union President <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> proposed pay hikes of 11 percent in the first year, followed by 10 percent in the second year. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> proposed at a news conference Thursday that the seven elected members of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> meet with union leaders to resolve the dispute. That would leave the superintendent and the district's negotiator out of the negotiating process. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate response to the proposal, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. The average teacher salary at the district's 825 schools and centers is $ 36,600. Starting teachers earn $ 23,440. The maximum salary, based on number of years and a doctorate degree, is $ 43,319. Some high school seniors are worried that their college applications could be affected if the official grades are withheld. But <ORGANIZATION> UTLA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrack </PERSON> said Thursday that applications to most colleges and universities would not be affected because less than 1 percent require mid-year grade reports. He also contended that any grade report accompanied by a credentialed teacher's signature is official in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> UTLA </ORGANIZATION> made the first moves toward a possible stike on Wednesday, when its 50 directors voted to ask that the union's 400-member House of Representatives approve a strike-authorization vote by the membership. However, <PERSON> Schrack </PERSON> said the union president would do everything to avoid a strike. The union last went on strike in 1970. He characterized the teachers' pay demand as lower on the list of their concerns than implementation of a `` school-based management concept'' that would allow greater teacher involvement in improving the educational process in the district, which has 594,800 students. Teachers also are concerned about reorganizing the district's financial priorities to provide more educational materials, he said In addition, he said, the teachers want to be relieved of unpaid duties such as schoolyard monitoring to give them more time in the classroom.

<UNK>Protestants and Catholics Hold Secret Talks on Power Sharing, BBC

 Protestant and <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Catholic </PERSON> politicians from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> met secretly in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a participant reported Thursday, and the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said they were exploring the possibility of a joint provincial government. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the politicians met Oct. 14-15 at the Angerhof Hotel between <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> and Duisburg and unanimously agreed they wanted to be partners in governing the troubled <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. It said the talks could produce the most important political breakthrough since sectarian violence in the Protestant-dominated province flared in August 1969. Meetings have continued in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since October, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Protestant party leaders who were not at the talks divorced themselves from the report. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, the province's leading Catholic politician, called the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> version `` nonsense. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionists </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s two main Protestant leaders, also denied the report. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said was a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> representative, had been <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s chief lieutenant but apparently has taken a more independent position recently. Deputy leader <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which gets support from both religious communities, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he participated in the talks. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said that in addition to <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the other two politicians who worked out the agreement in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, chairman of the Official Unionists, the largest Protestant party; and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> of the moderate Social Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> political group. <PERSON> Mawhinny </PERSON> said the talks were arranged by a German Lutheran church official for a different purpose, which he did not specify, but the four politicians involved departed from the agenda `` somewhat by accident'' and discussed their differences. `` There was a regular line of communication opened between the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> political parties and ... great willingness to look at the problems of the other community,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said there never has been a <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> initiative to solve the province's political problem and the fact that both sides had continued the secret talks at home for four months showed willingness to agree. Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> said Wednesday night behind-the-scenes contacts had been going on. `` This is a delicate and sensitive area,'' he said. `` There is a fair amount of contact taking place.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Northern Ireland Office, the Cabinet department in charge of the province, did not confirm knowledge of the talks, but said: `` If the reports of contact and talks between the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> parties are correct then the government would welcome them.'' From its establishment 1921 until 1972, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> had its own parliament and government, including control of security forces. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> handled only finance, defense and foreign affairs. With terrorist activity increasing, Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> decided in 1972 to end self-government and impose direct rule. That was followed by an agreement in 1974 to establish a <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> assembly of all parties. That plan collapsed on the issue of power sharing and Protestants opposed to joint rule with Catholics conducted several crippling strikes. Several unsuccessful attempts to revive the dialogue were made in the past decade. In its report Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said the so-called Duisburg Agreement provides for a provincial government with power shared by all parties at all levels and control of the police. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was not included in the talks. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. More than 2,700 people have been killed in sectarian violence in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since 1969.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, responding to a news report linking <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> radicals to the bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet, said Thursday the attack has not been solved yet. `` We are confident we will eventually find out who is responsible, but we should not expect a quick solution,'' spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Asked about a CBS News report implicating <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` the investigators have not yet reached any conclusion about who is responsible.'' A total of 270 people perished in the Dec. 21 crash, including 259 persons on the 747 jet and 11 persons in the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, where the plane hit. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and then went to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before taking off for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Wednesday night he could not confirm the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> report. `` I do n't know that any responsibility has been determined,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said at a White House reception. According to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, the attack on Flight 103 was in retaliation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986 and was also spurred by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision in December to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The network quoted sources `` deep within the terrorist movement.'' The principal architect of the bombing was <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, head of the extreme Palestinian group, the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, was working for <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, although he was also required to clear the operation with Syrian intelligence officials, the network reported. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> sent a distant cousin, <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaddafidam </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, who is known to hate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said. Three years ago, <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>: `` There will be no safety for any traveler on an Israeli or <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. airliner.'' <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a former officer in Syrian military intelligence, cleared the operation for an American target with Syrian intelligence and, with full backing of the <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> secret service, moved to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and made the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane his target, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said. The network quoted <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Shehabi </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jabril </PERSON> spokesman, as saying through an interpreter, `` I tell you that we did n't do it and we are not involved. We do n't practice terrorism and we condemn such actions.'' Investigators `` are close'' to accepting that chain of events as the official version, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said. Investigators believe that the bomb that destroyed Flight 103 was put aboard in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forth </ORGANIZATION> reported the bomb was planted by Palestinian terrorists in the luggage of a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent. The radio report, citing information from unidentified Scottish police sources, said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer was returning from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with five colleagues after a mission to negotiate release of the nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Scottish investigators refused comment on the Radio Forth report. In December, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was among the jet's passengers. They did not give the agent's name. Radio Forth did not name the agent it said was on the jet. It said investigators believe a three-pound charge of Semtex explosive and a timing device were slipped into the agent's luggage by Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated the secret <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> mission. The radio report said the baggage was shipped from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, where the agents caught the flight for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The timer was believed to have been activated during the stop in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, the report said.

 Hundreds of marchers hurled firebombs and clashed with club-swinging police on Thursday during a rally to protest the social event of the year at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s famed opera house. The crowd smashed windows, destroyed cars and hurled firecrackers and Molotov cocktails as they marched to protest the lavishness of the Opera Ball, an opulent party held annually at the opera house, police and witnesses said. Police in riot gear used rubber truncheons and water cannons to disperse the crowd as they moved toward the landmark building, witnesses said. Eight policemen were hurt, <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Boegl </PERSON> said on Austrian television. Witnesses also said demonstrators also were injured but police said they had no figures. Two Austrian television cameramen also were reported hurt. Five protesters were arrested at the site of the demonstration, police said. Two others, including a West German citizen, were arrested on the outskirts of town after firebombs were found in their car. Demonstrators, many with their faces covered by scarves or masks, shouted `` fascists'' as they clashed with police. Police estimated the crowd at 800 to 900 people, and witness accounts said as many as 2,000 people took part. Several groups organized the demonstration, which was banned by authorities. The rally's motto was `` Eat the Rich.'' Opera Ball guests had trouble getting to the opera house because all streets around the building were blocked off and entrances to subway stations closed, leading to a slight delay in the official opening of the ball. Inside the opera house, men in tails and women in elaborate ball gowns whirled to <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> waltzes, and opera stars <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreras </PERSON> and <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> performed a song together.

 Hundreds of political supporters clashed Thursday with backers of a rival party in a poor <LOCATION> Jamaican </LOCATION> neighborhood. Two people were shot to death and a 12-year-old boy was wounded, police said. `` All hell broke loose. There were gunshots from all angles,'' a policeman said on condition of anonymity. It was the third day of political violence as <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> prepares for general elections to be held Feb. 9. On Wednesday, police used tear gas to break up a confrontation between rival parties in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, outside the capital of <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>. Two women were shot to death Tuesday. The deaths Thursday raised to eight the number of people reported killed since Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> launched the campaign on Jan. 15 by announcing the election date. Police said Thursday's violence began when <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Davey </PERSON>, a candidate for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for the leftist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was campaigning with 1,000 supporters in <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>'s Land, a poor <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> neighborhood.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> voiced some of his harshest criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Thursday, accusing it of jeopardizing relations with its stand on a disputed beach resort. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been guilty of `` repulsive'' equivocation over withdrawing from <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, a Sinai border enclave <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said the Israeli position is threatening normalization of relations under the two countries' 1979 peace treaty. The tone of his remarks to reporters reflected exasperation and, at times, anger. He made the comments even though the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said it was committed to withdrawal. It also agreed to follow recommendations of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediator to get talks back under way, said a government official on condition of anonymity. But no timetable for withdrawal was announced. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said he was `` disappointed'' by the criticism. `` I think we are very close to reaching an agreement,'' he said. `` I think a little more goodwill on both sides will bring us to agreement. `` There is no stalling. We are doing all we can to finish these discussions as soon as possible.'' In Thursday's remarks, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> charged that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is dragging its feet on withdrawing the the <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> resort at the southern end of the common border. On Sept. 29, an arbitration panel drew a border to within a few hundred yards of the resort. The ruling seemed to put the enclave in Egyptian territory. However, if the line were extended at a sharp angle, the resort could still fall in Israeli territory. The Egyptian leader said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> first sought to delay putting the ruling into effect because of its parliamentary elections last fall and formation of a new Cabinet. `` Now they want another delay,'' he said. `` We want to build confidence, but this method of equivocation and dilly-dallying does not inspire confidence ... This method is repulsive, and we refuse pressure.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> again rejected <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s attempts to link withdrawal from the 250-acre area with compensation for an Israeli-owned hotel and other resort facilities and access for Israeli tourists. He said withdrawal must come first. Two rounds of U.S.-mediated talks on <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> last month ended in deadlock, mainly over the linkage issue. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> took office in 1981, and the <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> dispute began the next year when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew from the rest of the Sinai under terms of the 1979 peace treaty. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> legal adviser who has been mediating the talks, went from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on Thursday to meet with Egyptian officials. An <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source speaking on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> had offered new proposals to both sides and that he was leaving for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday. The source gave no details of the proposals.

 President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> said Thursday the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is less ideological than its predecessor and more likely to help achieve peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Also Thursday, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyos </PERSON> said the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would offer to hold free elections and would moderate its communist revolution. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who is among the world leaders in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> this week for the inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, said in a televised interview that his talks with Central American leaders indicate `` everyone is working in the direction of peace.'' He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is `` more pragmatic and less ideological'' than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and `` can reach a political solution'' to the conflicts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has opened arms-sale talks with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that potentially include shipping 315 Abrams tanks, considered the world's best, to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and 40 sophisticated FA-18 jet fighters to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, congressional and other sources said Thursday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Other Arab states would be in line for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armaments under the proposal, made in the next to the last day of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and now the focus of discussions between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Also proposed: 200 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tanks, seven multiple-launched battlefield rocket systems and 1,500 Tow anti-tank missiles for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>; 40 Maverick air-to-ground missiles with an infra-red guidance system and electronic warfare gear for <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>; 24 F-16 jet fighters, 100 <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION> and 100 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles for <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, and seven of the battlefield rocket systems for <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> would get 60 M48 tanks and 100 Harpoon anti-ship missiles for <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> follows through, the proposed Arab sales would seem sure to touch off a battle with congressional supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which is concerned that sophisticated weapons in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hands could be turned against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> conflict. The list is classified; a copy was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, declined to identify the weapons under consideration for sale. He stressed that the document did not amount to a `` sale plan,'' but rather to the administration's `` best estimate'' of other countries' weapons needs. `` Each item has to be reviewed by this administration,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power to block a purchase, but only if a majority of both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reject a formal <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> notification of intended sale. The informal list was sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 19 by the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opened talks with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last Friday, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who declined to be identified. Currently, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only shares the Abrams tank, also known as the M1A1, only with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The two nations have a co-production agreement, but the proposed sale would mean the tanks would be sold to nations other than <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Under the plan now under discussion, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would be sold 150 Hawk missiles, 24 helicopters, artillery radar and tank equipment. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be sold 200 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles, 24 helicopters and new equipment for its F-15 jet fighters. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> again would receive no American weapons. Since 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has prohibited militry aid to the Arab kingdon until it agrees to peace terms with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the sources said that the White House, in a cover letter, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the Saudis are now deciding whether to request <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or European fighters to replace over the coming decade their aging fleet of U.S.-made F-5s. The letter said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> were considering jets to be jointly produced by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> along with the French Mirage 4000 and U.S.-built F-16s and FA-18s.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday night voted to reject a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise, but Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would let it take effect next week and then vote to reduce it to `` a decent raise'' of 30 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 95-5 to reject the raise for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other top federal officials, and to change the law to eliminate current procedures which allow a pay increase to take effect without a vote. Then, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave voice vote approval to legislation to ban members from pocketing speaking fees or other honoraria, should the pay raise take effect. Five senators voted against the package to eliminate the currently-proposed pay increase, to roll back the pay raise if the deadline is missed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and to require votes on all future pay raises. They were <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. The final joint resolution was approved by a voice vote. The vote against the pay increase was lopsided but largely symbolic, since both chambers must vote to block it. House procedures make it easier to protect a pay raise in that chamber, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, continued as the main target of opponents as he maneuvered to protect most of the raise. House members' public positions, like those of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, have been overwhelmingly against the 51 percent pay increase, which must be disapproved by both chambers before Feb. 8 or it will automatically take effect. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said Thursday a `` clear majority'' of members, now paid $ 89,500, privately supported his plan for dodging a pre-deadline vote and then voting a partial rollback of the raise along with a ban on honoraria. However, the restrictive parliamentary procedure planned by the speaker requires a tough two-thirds vote before the bill could be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The 51 percent raise above the current $ 89,500 salary would remain in effect unless both chambers agreed to cut it back, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> opponents vowed to roll it back to zero whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> wins or loses. `` It would be very difficult for the speaker to find two-thirds for this resolution,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, even though <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s tactic would force pay raise opponents to appear to be voting to protect the full pay increase. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> released partial results of a personal questionnaire, showing 57 percent of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members opposing a pay raise vote before the deadline and 54 percent favoring instead a vote to reduce the raise to 30 percent. The $ 26,850 pay raise he was proposing was `` a decent raise but not an exorbitant raise,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, compared with the $ 45,500 increase proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and endorsed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The 30 percent figure was equal to the amount of income <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members could lose in a ban on honoraria. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> figure is $ 35,800, as they are currently allowed to retain honoraria equal to 40 percent of their salaries. House members would still make the same amount of money they make now, he said. `` The difference is we will be serving one master, not two, that is, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said. Actually, most <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would find their incomes substantially increased, since fewer than half reach the current honoraria limit of 30 percent of income, according to their financial disclosures. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said it was his intention that all top federal officials, including federal judges, would receive the same increase. Under his strategy, federal judges might still win the full 51 percent pay increase, since under the Constitution those new salaries can not be reduced once enacted. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has met with House Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to solicit his endorsement of the plan. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was joined at his news conference only by four leading Democratic members, and the second-ranked Republican in the House supported the concept of a dollar-for-dollar trade-off of salary for honoraria. `` If we do an effective job of prohibiting outside earned income, then an adjustment of that size would be appropriate,'' he said. `` Whether we do it before or after the eighth -LRB- of February -RRB- is less important than what's in the package,'' he said. As the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opened its debate, Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said also supported the concept behind the speaker's 30 percent proposal, and said it was unfair to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to take the brunt of criticism. But he acknowledged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would follow public opinion and kill the entire raise. `` If contemporary public opinion were the sole determinant, the pay ... would be the same as it was in 1789,'' he said. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I do think there should be a pay raise'' but he said `` there's no way you can explain'' 51 percent. Although a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote to kill the pay raise was long expected, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership's original plan was to weather the storm of public protest and let the pay raise take effect. Then, to lessen the political damage, they planned action on a bipartisan package of reforms including an honoraria ban. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> this week changed the course when he promised to hold a vote to kill the raise before the deadline if a majority of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members wanted it. A subsequent <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey on Wednesday showed 88 percent of those responding favored such a vote, but <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said 57 percent of those responding to his private tally wanted the deadline to pass. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s survey `` exposes members to a charge of lying,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, the consumer advocate, citing the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and surveys by his own organization. Numerous public surveys showed members of both chambers would vote overwhelmingly against accepting the pay increase. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would vote on rolling back the increase on Feb. 9 as part of an ethics package which would include: _ An immediate ban on members accepting fees for speaking, writing, consulting, or legal or professional services. _ Restrictions on travel expenses. _ A repeal, effective in 1991, of the law allowing senior lawmakers to pocket excess campaign funds. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s proposal came on the eve of the annual <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic retreat at the posh <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> resort in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, which is subsidized by corporate and union donations.

 Two explosions caused by runaway railroad cars rocked <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s capital city Thursday, cutting off electricity and forcing the evacuation of thousands as wind chills dipped to 70 degrees below zero. The runaway cars derailed and hit a propane tank near the railroad tracks, setting off an explosion. Minutes later, the fire from the blast caused one of the derailed cars containing a highly flammable chemical to blow up, authorities said. A second car containing plastic also burned, producing a cloud of black smoke that prompted the evacuations. The force of the 4:48 a.m. blasts overturned automobiles, shattered windows up to two miles away, damaged a nearby college and homes, and hurled pieces of railroad cars through buildings a quarter-mile away. But only two minor injuries were reported. `` It's a miracle no one was killed or injured,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Schild </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> undersheriff. Mayor <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> estimated the damage at $ 3 million. The accident happened as a severe cold snap paralyzed the state. Gov. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> shut down state government throughout <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, citing the bitter-cold temperatures, power outages and fumes emitted by the fire. Authorities originally believed that a railroad car containing polyvinyl chloride was on fire. PVC produces dangerous hydrogen chloride gas when ignited, and the belief prompted the evacuations and orders to stay indoors. But authorities later discovered that the hopper car, though it carried a sign indicating PVC was aboard, actually contained granular polyethylene, and that the smoke billowing over the valley was carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. `` It dissipates in the atmosphere and is not serious,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON>, the county disaster coordinator. But the fire proved stubborn, and the blaze was still smoldering Thursday night despite firefighting efforts. Fire officials feared the blaze could ignite a nearby tank car that contained hydrogen peroxide, the chemical that exploded, but they believed that a layer of ice that encased the car would lessen the threat, <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON> said. The explosions occurred in an open area on the city's west side and severed one of three major power lines, authorities said. Although power initially was knocked out for 37,000 people in and around <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, electricity was restored to most areas by 11 a.m. Authorities evacuated about 2,000 people from an area one square mile around the burning railroad car, said City Manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Verwolf </PERSON>. Residents were allowed to return starting late afternoon, when the fire was under control, he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the chain of events began when a cab heater malfunctioned in a <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> locomotive hauling 48 freight cars over the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Divide west of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. `` The crew stopped the freight to exchange the lead locomotive for another lead locomotive with a better heater ...,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` This manuever required them to disconnect the locomotives from the 48 freight cars being hauled. `` When the exchange of locomotives was complete, the crew returned to pick up the freight cars only to find they were gone,'' it said, adding that the cars had rolled 12 miles east to <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said the runaway cars hit another locomotive and 21 of the cars derailed. One of those cars hit a propane tank alongside the track, the agency said, touching off an explosion. `` The ensuing fire triggered a second explosion in one of the hazardous material cars,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FRA </ORGANIZATION> said `` I jumped out of the way from being squashed,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McNellis </PERSON>, who was aboard the locomotive that was struck as it was switching to another track. One paramedic was taken to a hospital after inhaling fumes. Firefighters wore respirators as they poured water on the flames. Evacuees fled to churches, the <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> armory and schools, which were already closed by the severe cold. Temperatures hovered near 30 degrees below zero, which combined with winds to produce wind chills of 70 degrees below zero, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Snow fell intermittently. `` The weather could n't be worse,'' said <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>. `` Displacing people in these circumstances is tragic, but Helenans are tough people. We'll adjust.'' The collision occurred in an open area between the city dump and golf course, about a quarter-mile north of <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` If it was n't for that golf course and the -LRB- adjacent -RRB- baseball diamonds, we'd have a lot of tragedies,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>. Nearly all windows were shattered at <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> buildings, the school's physical education center had portions of its roof blown out, and pieces of railroad car dotted a snow-covered field near a dormitory a quarter-mile away. A 1,500-pound railroad coupler fell through the roof of a dormitory, but no one was injured, authorities said. `` Our campus has suffered extensive damage,'' said <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, who is also head of development for <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a Helena airport policeman helping with security at the blast site, said a set of railroad car axles and wheels went through the roof of a home near the college, but no one was injured. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said two windows were blown out of his house, about a third of a mile from the blast. `` The explosion shook the whole house,'' he said. `` I saw the flash of light between our venetian blinds. I was thinking, ` World War III or something.'''

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> resigned Thursday as leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but said he will carry on as the country's leader after he recuperates from a stroke. Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was narrowly elected as the new leader of the party _ which has held power for 40 years _ and consolidated his status as the favorite to become the next president. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, a leading anti-apartheid activist, said that repression of blacks under de Klerk likely would intensify. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, told party officials in a letter that he was resigning the party post, which he assumed in 1978, to concentrate on presidential duties and distance the presidency from partisan politics. He did not elaborate. He is recuperating at his home in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> from the Jan. 18 stroke that weakened his left arm and left leg. Doctors said Thursday <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was recovering rapidly, but will need at least one more month of rest before he can return to work. Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> was appointed acting president during <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s recovery, but he placed third in Thursday's vote for a new party leader behind <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and Finance Minister <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON>. As education minister, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, 52, has tried to avoid ideological labels and has not been associated with major innovations. Last year, he proposed controversial steps to reduce financial aid to universities that allowed demonstrations protesting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid system of racial separation. As leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has tried to halt defections to the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He supports <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s policies of slow-paced reform that would lead to limited power-sharing with blacks, who are in the majority but have no vote in national affairs. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> declined to discuss his political agenda but said the party would `` change in step with the times.'' He said he would consult with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> before proposing any policy changes. `` A very special relationship will now have to develop between myself as leader-in-chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on the one hand and the state president as chief executive on the other hand,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s parliamentary caucus chose de Klerk over du <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON> by a vote of 69-61. The other contenders _ Heunis and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> _ were eliminated in early rounds of balloting. <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, a liberal opposition member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said the balloting indicated dissatisfaction with `` the old-style <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Almost half the caucus opted for a more dynamic and more modern leadership,'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, leader of the mixed-race chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said it did not matter who led the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` As long as the policies of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> are executed, there is no hope for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hendrickse </PERSON>, who was fired from <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s Cabinet in 1987 after urging the abolition of residential segregation. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said he believed party politics would prompt <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to take a tougher stand on apartheid. `` I do n't believe there will be any significant changes because they both come out of the same stable,'' the Nobel Prize-winning activist, who is on a three-day trip to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, told reporters in Merthyr Tydfil, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. `` But there appears to be a split in the party and the new leader has to establish himself. `` In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, that means being a toughie _ and they can not be trifled with,'' he said. `` I will be very surprised if we do n't see an intensification of the repression. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s president is chosen by an electoral college dominated by the party that controls <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds 133 of 178 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s white chamber, and it can carry out its wishes over combined opposition from the smaller Asian and mixed-race chambers. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> became party leader in 1978, when he was elected prime minister. He became president in 1984 under a new constitution that abolished the prime minister post. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to discuss his possible retirement, but has said he wants to reduce his work load. Legislation is pending that would revive the post of prime minister to share leadership duties with the president. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, as acting president, will open this year's session of Parliament in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> on Friday. There was widespread speculation <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would use the occasion to call for a national election in April, but political analysts say his stroke means an election is unlikely until later in the year. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which enacted the country's apartheid laws after taking power in 1948, is expected to maintain power in the next election.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House of Commons on Thursday voted down a measure that would have allowed civil servants to leak state secrets to the news media in the public interest. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government defeated the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> proposal 267-179 despite the defection of 18 Conservative legislators, including former Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, who voted in favor of the measure. The measure was a proposed amendment to the Official Secrets Bill, which is being proposed as a replacement for the government's 78-year-old Official Secrets Act The full bill is designed to reduce some of the government's sweeping powers to declare virtually anything a state secret The bill proposes to decriminalize some trivial leaks and make prosecutions in some cases more difficult. The full bill was approved in principle by Commons last year. It is now going through a stage where parties are adding various amendments, which are voted upon individually by the Commons. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> said civil servants prosecuted for leaking official secrets should be able to claim they acted in the public interest, if indeed that was the case. He said a `` public interest'' clause was needed because the public had a right to know instances of wrongdoing. Labor's deputy leader, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattersley </PERSON>, said the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> government's `` obsession with secrecy is not so much about protecting information necessary to our security but suppressing information that is embarrassing to the government.'' But Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the Cabinet member responsible for law and order, said, `` We have to take into account public servants who might have less good motives.'' The bill now before Commons proposes to confine secrecy mainly to defense, security and foreign affairs. But civil libertarians, newspapers editors and opposition parties say the bill does not go far enough to protect individual freedoms of speech or measures guaranteeing news media freedom. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has no equivalent of First Amendment or of the Freedom of Information Act.

 Gunmen opened fire on a convoy of about 30 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers taking part in military maneuvers on Thursday and struck one of the vehicles, officials said. The identity of the gunmen was not known, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. `` An undetermined number of men fired at the convoy from a hilltop near the highway but there were no injuries,'' he said. `` Two shots hit the last vehicle in the convoy.'' <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said officials believe four or five shots were fired at the seven-vehicle convoy. `` We do n't know if it was an attempted attack or a mistake, but it is being investigated,'' he said. He said the incident took place at about 1 p.m. in <LOCATION> Yoro </LOCATION> province, about 125 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The convoy immediately returned to <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, about 100 miles away, he said.

<DATELINE>FORT ORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pilots of two <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters that crashed at Fort Ord were on a training mission with night-vision goggles linked to numerous accidents, an official said Thursday. Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scotton </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Laytonsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, son of <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scotton </PERSON>, was killed in the crash Wednesday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. Another soldier suffered multiple fractures and two others were released after treatment of minor injuries. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, were trying to determine whether the choppers, working together with two soldiers aboard each, collided before they went down 150 yards apart, said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` They were on a night goggle training mission,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` They signed out for the goggles but we do n't know if they were wearing them at the time of the accident.'' The crashes occurred just hours after Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind., said a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee will investigate accidents involving the military's use of night-vision goggles The soldiers signed out with the newer ANAVS-6 goggles, which have been in use since March 1987. An older model, ANPVS-5, has been used since the early 1970s. Of 23 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopter accidents since Oct. 1985, 11 have involved pilots wearing the newer ANAVS-6 goggles, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapla </PERSON> at the Pentagon. He said, however, `` we have n't been able to determine that any goggles have been a direct cause in any of the crashes.'' Fort Ord spokesman <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said the newer goggles were specifically designed for night flying and corrected the problems of the older models, which were intended for ground use. But <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said, `` The overall situation has not greatly improved.'' At least 62 helicopters have gone down and 134 servicemen have died in the past decade in crashes in which the pilots were looking through night-vision goggles the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> allegedly knew were unsafe, the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> reported in December. The military blamed almost all of the crashes on pilot error. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s request for the investigation, to take place later this month, was approved Wednesday by the newly appointed chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mavroules </PERSON>, D-Mass. The older goggles, used primarily by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, electronically amplify moonlight and starlight, partly improving night vision but also sacrificing peripheral sight and reducing normal 20-20 vision to 20-50 or worse. Those goggles can lead to eye fatigue and illusions, the Register said, and tend to shut down in clouds and prevent pilots from seeing and avoiding clouds. It had been cloudy and raining off and on Wednesday. In December, <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> asked the Army to prohibit the use of the obsolete goggles and accelerate purchase of the new goggles. But in a letter delivered Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> refused. `` This decision is based on our safety record, intense training programs, and the acute level of safety awareness throughout the chain of command,'' wrote <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for research, development and acquisition. In the crashes at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, Chief Warrant Officer 2nd Class Tracy J. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 27, suffered multiple fractures and was in stable condition Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Letterman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Chief Warrant Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, 28, and Warrant Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, 24, were treated for minor bumps and cuts at Fort Ord and released. The two downed aircraft were an AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter and an OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopter. Both were unarmed and assigned to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>'s 123rd <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, said Shields.

 Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s wide-ranging royal rounds Thursday took her from a family living in a homeless shelter to <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schwarz </ORGANIZATION>'s treasure trove of toys, topped by a night at the opera and the visit's first protesters. Cheering crowds turned out at each stop to glimpse the princess, who thrilled some Lower East Siders by shaking some hands and accepting flowers. The exception was a crowd of more than 400 Irish-American protesters across from the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION>, where the princess attended the American debut of the Welsh National Opera. A dinner at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center was planned after the opera performance of `` Falstaff.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, a potential mayoral candidate, said, `` The protest is not directed against Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, it's directed against her as a symbol of British government, which for much too long has inhabited <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and depressed Irish Catholics.'' Both Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> were heckled as they arrived at the academy, in a neighborhood where scattered renovations and new businesses contrast with dilapidated low-income housing. When <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, wearing a white evening gown, arrived by limousine with a police escort, she was cheered by a smattering of local residents while the protesters loudly chanted `` <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> spoke with her in a receiving line, telling reporters <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> told him she hoped her motorcade was n't tying up traffic. As for the protesters invoking the name of the British-outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said: `` She did n't mention it. I did n't mention it It's part of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> landscape.'' Inside, as she entered a balcony box, the orchestra sounded a drum roll and a hush fell over the audience. The orchestra played `` God Save the Queen,'' the `` Star Spangled Banner'' and the `` <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthem </ORGANIZATION>.'' From the stage, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> told her: `` I want to bid you welcome. The city is graced by your presence. We want to be sure your visit goes just the way you want it to be so when you go home you can say you had a royal time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' Also at the performance was <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, who described <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> as `` marvelous, attractive, beautiful and seems to be doing a great job as future queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' At the upscale Fifth Avenue toy store <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schwarz </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> attended a luncheon to promote British-made toys and toured its floors with store president <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` It must be fun to be in a place like this every day,'' store spokeswoman <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> quoted the princess as saying. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> stopped frequently to admire items, saying, `` Oh, this is cute,'' and commenting that her children, <PERSON> Princes </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON>, would enjoy them. Her favorite appeared to be a large white teddy bear. She shook hands with several onlookers outside the store before leaving. Earlier Thursday <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> visited the Henry Street Settlement, a community center on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> that has helped the disadvantaged for nearly a century. There she met <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, a homeless woman who temporarily lives in an apartment supplied by the shelter, and other women who were once homeless. `` These are really terrific women,'' the princess said, according to the settlement's director, <PERSON> Verona </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeter </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> on her tour. `` She was really impressed with them,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jeter </PERSON> said. And 7-year-old <PERSON> Raamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> was impressed with her. `` She's nice Like a friend of mine,'' he said. At the settlement's day care center, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> visited a group of 11 children ages 2 to 5, crouching low to admire the valentines they were making and chatting softly with them. She tied the shoe of one boy. She complimented the work of another youngster, saying, `` I love the Cupid in the heart. Is that for Mommy?'' related teacher <PERSON> Janeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. Day care center director <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> said of the children, `` They're crazed _ there's no ifs, ands or buts about it.'' Hundreds of residents of the adjacent Baruch Houses project filled the sidewalks hoping for a glimpse at the princess, who twice during her tour came as close to the crowds as police barricades allowed. `` We can hold our head up high and say, ` Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> came to the Lower East Side,''' said <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, who shook <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s hand.

<HEAD>Elderly Woman Who Loves Cats Fined $50 For Leash-Law Violation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An elderly widow who faced up to $ 900 in fines for failing to curb a cat lost her court case Thursday, but was fined only $ 50. A Municipal Court jury found that 80-year-old <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> violated the city's leash law and failed to immunize one of her cats against rabies as required by city ordinance. A neighbor claimed that numerous cats fed by Ms. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> used his property as a litter box, but the case in court involved only one pet. Ms. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>' attorney said the fine would be appealed. But Ms. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, who lives on a monthly $ 410 Social Security payment, also promised to do a better job keeping track of her felines. `` If they get out, I ca n't help it,'' she said after the hearing. `` But I'm going to do my best to keep them on my own property.'' Charges against Ms. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> involve two of six citations she has received since July, resulting from complaints filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by neighbor <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, in testimony Wednesday, said Ms. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>' penchant for feeding stray animals had created an `` unbearable'' problem, with cats invading and defecating upon his property. `` I had piles _ mounds _ of dung in my flower bed,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, 56, testified. `` The stench was unbearable. I could n't even open my windows.'' Further testimony revealed that one of the cats Ms. <PERSON> Farris </PERSON> had fed came from <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s son and daughter-in-law.

<TEXT>
 A former sheriff was arrested Thursday and charged with hiring hit men to detonate a bomb that nearly killed the man who defeated him in his bid for re-election. Former Lafourche Parish Sheriff <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> Thibodaux </LOCATION>, who was defeated in 1975 by Sheriff <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, was arrested along with a former policeman, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, 42, of Slaughter. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> refused to give a motive or say whether <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> was after <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> because of a political vendetta. `` It's safe to say he supplied the money and wanted it done,'' <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said. The bomb, made of pipe stuffed with explosives, bullets and nails and hidden in a sack, exploded Dec. 15 outside <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>'s car, injuring <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, 60, and part-time Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Leche </PERSON>, 62, as they left a Christmas party at <LOCATION> Thibodaux </LOCATION>. The bomb nearly blew off <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>' foot as he was entering the car, but he underwent massive reconstructive surgery and is recovering. Leche was less severly injured. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> agent with the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>, said $ 20,000 was promised for the job, but only $ 10,000 was actually paid to the hitmen. He said former policemen <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>, 42, of Slaughter and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amant </PERSON>, both of whom were arrested Tuesday, were paid $ 8,000 after the explosion and that <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> got $ 2,000 more. In addition, <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, who was said to own the remote control device that set off the bomb, was paid $ 666, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. A criminal complaint, filed after the Thursday arrests, said an unidentified man came to authorities and admitted his part in the scheme and helped catch the others. `` On Feb. 2, special agents of the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> monitored a conversation between a confidential source and <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> ` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON><PERSON> ' </PERSON> <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON>,'' the complaint said. `` During the meeting, <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> described his knowledge of the bombing ... and admitted supplying officer <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> an extra $ 2,000 for his part in the bombing and gave the confidential source $ 100 to help him leave town and admitted that he -LRB- <LOCATION> Tardo </LOCATION> -RRB- entered into an agreement with <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> that <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> would remain silent if arrested.'' <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON>, a retired state policeman who is now a private investigator and insurance agent, was sheriff from 1971 to 1975, when he was defeated by <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>. He later lost a 1980 election for a <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> seat, and served as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Lafourche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> from 1983-87. He was defeated in a re-election bid. The Thursday arrests came shortly after a federal grand jury indicted <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> in connection with the bombing. Charges against <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON> were the same as those against the others in the indictment. They were one count of conspiracy to maliciously damage the sheriff's vehicle, one count of damaging the vehicle and one count of illegal possession of a destructive device. The men face maximum penalties of 35 years in prison and a $ 750,000 fine on the federal charges, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>. They also face two counts each of attempted murder filed by the <LOCATION> Lafourche </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> district attorneys' office Wednesday.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Thursday criticized former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> for meeting with Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, saying such action `` has a chance of complicating matters.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> for comments reporters said the former president hadmade urging the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to use economic persuasion in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to encourage the U.S.-backed government there to fight human rights abuses. `` If he's calling for economic sanctions against <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>, yes, he's complicating matters,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it's particularly helpful for a former president to make those kind of statements. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked about the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> criticism of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, said, `` I'm not aware of what the vice president said nor do I have any reaction from the president. I saw the picture of former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on the couch there this morning _ they looked pretty comfortable.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, on his first diplomatic mission as vice president, was to stop Friday in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> after leaving <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. He has said he wants to emphasize concern for human rights and support for democracy there. Asked if he has talked to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since arriving Wednesday in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said no, noting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has laryngitis and a cold. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> for Thursday's inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, said Wednesday night that he and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> had met with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> earlier in the day and that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> shared with them a new proposal to resolve <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s war against the Contra rebels He declined to discuss details of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s plan with reporters, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they had not seen it. But officials said they had heard from those familiar with it that it dealt with resettlement of the Contras. And <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> characterized it as pricipally a matter between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, which the Contras have used as a staging ground. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has refused to hold talks with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> must first negotiate with their opposition `` Obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads of state we do n't meet with, it has a chance of complicating matters,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said at a news conference following the inaugural ceremony. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal is to see free and fair elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and a regional solution to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s problems. During a current hiatus, with no congressional money in the pipeline for the Contras, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> should hold a `` serious dialogue with the resistance within his own country'' and neighboring nations. `` We are going to give the diplomatic route a chance,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. But he added that he felt the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had worsened since the cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras. `` This is a testing period for us,'' to see if <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is serious about following conditions set out in the 1987 peace plan agreed to by five Central American presidents at a meeting in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, he said. Contra leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, also attending the inauguration, said that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told him the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administraton supports the Contras but that he offered no specific commitment. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> met briefly in the <ORGANIZATION> Caracas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> hotel lobby Thursday morning, as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held meetings upstairs with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> The meeting with <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> centered on the Latin debt crisis. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to consider the adverse affect that his country's debt has on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s ability to promote democratic institutions, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials here said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is making no promises about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's developing policy regarding the debt. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s day also included meetings with presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and a lunch with <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> leaders. ` You can feel the good chemistry,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` You can feel the positive, upbeat mood that they're in'' in looking to dealings with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. After meeting with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said he is encouraged about the new administration, and is convinced President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will hold give the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> a chance to resolve their problems diplomatically. But he said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did n't make any specific commitment on renewed Contra aid. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> also said he had not received anything new from <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> in the way of a peace proposal.

 Three men and two boys were arrested Thursday after four armed robberies of Amish residents near this rural town over the past two weeks, authorities said. `` I feel that we've got all the people involved in the Amish robberies,'' said <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON>. Six Amish residents in the county about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> were robbed in a string of holdups that began Jan. 22 when a gunman took $ 85 from two men in a milk barn. On Jan. 28, an armed man leaped into two Amish buggies traveling down a dark country road. About $ 140 was taken in those holdups. On Jan. 30, an Amish harnessmaker was held up at his shop by two men in a pickup truck who made off with about $ 300. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, no age available, <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 22, each were charged with one count of armed robbery, and additional charges were expected, <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON> said. The sheriff identified <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> as the uncle of the Smiths, who he said are brothers. Each was being held on $ 250,000 bond pending a hearing Friday, he said. The two other suspects, ages 16 and 17, were being held by juvenile authorities, said <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON>. All five suspects are from <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pyrum </PERSON> said the arrests came after investigators matched a partial license plate number with a description of the pickup used in the last holdup. He also said that two of the adults had confessed to the robberies. The sheriff said he expected the full cooperation of the Amish victims in prosecuting the suspects. `` They're very interested in getting these people caught,'' said <PERSON> Pyrdum </PERSON>. `` Although the Amish are not known as prosecutors, they will testify.'' The Amish, a conservative sect of the <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, are noted for their simple lifestyle, which includes wearing plain, dark clothing. They do not use electricity or motorized vehicles and refuse to bear arms for self-defense or to take oaths. The Lawrence County Amish, who number fewer than 500, came to southern <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in 1944. Most of them farm, although some also produce leather goods and furniture or do carpentry and blacksmith work.

<HEAD>Schools Shut Down; Government Backs Allegation of Imminent Uprising</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Schools in a northern port city shut down on Thursday after students walked out to protest a government claim that a peasant revolt was brewing, radio reports said. The government, meanwhile, said it has found new evidence that a revolt was imminent and said the developments `` justify urgent government measures.'' The independent <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> said the students in <LOCATION> Gonaives </LOCATION> charged that the government was looking for an excuse to crack down on peasants and opposition leaders. Tires were set afire in some <LOCATION> Gonaives </LOCATION> streets, but no violence was reported in the city. The protest came after a memo from Information Minister <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint-Pierre </PERSON> advised Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, the country's military ruler, that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and other leftist groups were planning an armed insurrection with large landowners. The memo said the rebellion was being supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, according to Haitian radio stations. The memorandum, dated Jan. 13, alleged the insurrection would occur `` in the next few days'' and recommended that it be put down `` by force and even with bloodshed.'' Col. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsainvil </PERSON>, the defense and interior minister, backed the earlier memo said in a new statement. `` This report provoked the immediate creation of an investigation commission. The first results have confirmed the existence of certain problems which really justify urgent government measures,'' said a communique signed by <PERSON> Dorsainvil </PERSON> and broadcast by several radio stations Thursday. Late Wednesday, nine political and union leaders, in a joint statement broadcast by independent <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION>, called for <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s resignation, saying he `` has shown his determination to perpetuate the autocratic and bloody Duvalierist regime.'' Dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1986, ending a 29-year family dynasty. In his memorandum, <PERSON> Saint-Pierre </PERSON> charged that the `` peasant insurrection'' was being led by the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Papaye </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s Central Plateau with help from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of several leftist organizations. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON>, the group's co-leader who was named by <PERSON> Saint-Pierre </PERSON> as an instigator of the uprising, also denied involvement and said Thursday he would sue the information minister. `` Today, the life of every democrat in this country is threatened,'' <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> said on independent <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>. About 80 percent of Haitians are impoverished peasants, and many of them work for wealthy landowners. In July 1987 about 300 landless peasants demanding land reform near the northwest town of <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabel </PERSON> were killed in a clash with sharecroppers working for landowners. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> became president after soldiers, demanding a return to democracy, ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> on Sept. 17. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> came to power after <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> left in 1986.

 All 52 cars of a freight train derailed near here Thursday, halting passenger rail service between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and stranding <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passengers, officials said. About 10.4 million pounds of corn spilled from the cars, blocking traffic on both mainline tracks, said <ORGANIZATION> Glacier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Melonas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <PERSON> Havre </PERSON>, cars were strewn over a three-mile stretch of track. No one was injured and the cause of the derailment was under investigation, he said. Most of the 123 passengers on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s westbound Empire Builder were stranded in <PERSON> Havre </PERSON>, a town of 10,000 near the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> border and about 200 miles east of the derailment. Most of the passengers were staying at the LeHavre Inn. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bucksport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, said she was traveling to <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` The <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> people have been super to us. As for what we're doing in <PERSON> Havre </PERSON>, we're just kind of visiting and taking it all in,'' she said <PERSON> Erling </PERSON> <PERSON> Strandlund </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> chef, said his train had stopped Wednesday near Havre just before midnight `` because of engine troubles and the freezing cold.'' Temperatures in the area have been hovering at 30-40 degrees below zero for several days. `` We were prepared to head west this morning, but now, with the derailment ahead to the west, I have no idea how long we'll be here,'' <PERSON> Strandlund </PERSON> said. The derailment near the southern tip of Glacier National Park was the third in that area in the past six weeks. Plans were being made to route freight trains around the derailment, but <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> officials said passenger trains eastbound from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and westbound from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> were canceled until further notice. Passengers already in transit between the two cities were being bused around the derailment, officials said.

 <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> tied the eighth game in their World Chess Championship Candidates quarterfinal on Thursday, forcing the contest into high-speed tiebreakers. The 51-move draw left the match score tied 4-4. On Saturday, they will begin a series of sudden-death encounters played at an increasingly fast pace. In the first game, each player will have an hour's thinking time for the entire game. If there is no victor, the time will be reduced to a half hour each for the second duel, and halved again to 15 minutes each for the third game. If necesary, more 15-minute games will be played until one player wins. At a brief drawing of lots ceremony, <LOCATION> Spraggett </LOCATION>, a 34-year-old from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and pre-match underdog, was loudly applauded when he gained the advantage of the white pieces for the first game. The winner of the contest will advance to the semifinal stage. The winner of the Candidates will challenge world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title in 1990. Playing white in an English opening, <LOCATION> Spraggett </LOCATION> saddled <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> with weak Queenside pawns and forced <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> on to the defensive. But the 28-year-old Muscovite defended accurately and <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> offered a draw after a five and half hour battle. `` It ` s very dificult at this level to nurture a small advantage,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON>, a Candadian international master who is commenting on the games. Canadians are hoping <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> will triumph in the blitz finish and become the first North American since <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> to reach the world chess semifinals. In the previous stage of the competition, <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> scored a dramatic, giantkilling victory over Soviet Grandmaster <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON> in their fourth tiebreaking game. <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON> said <PERSON> Spraggett </PERSON> will go into the sudden-death playoff with an advantage `` because he's got strong nerves.' Other experts said <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> ` s extensive international experience could be the decisive factor. British Grandmaster <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> is already through to the semifinals. In the third match, under way in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, former world champion <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has established a crushing 2.5-0 .5 lead over <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjartarson </PERSON> After two games, Dutch Grandmaster <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lajos </PERSON> <PERSON> Portisch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are tied with 1 point apiece in their six-game duel in <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>.

 A military fighter-bomber crashed Thursday in northeastern <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, with its two crewmen parachuting to safety just seconds before the plane hit the ground. `` They were at about 1,000 feet when they separated,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Boog </PERSON>, a doctor who saw the crash from his car. `` Then the plane hit the ground and exploded. And it just disintegrated. There are parts scattered a quarter mile in every direction.'' A military spokesman would not say whether the FB-111 was armed, but local emergency rescue officials told people at the scene it was not. The plane, a medium-range fighter-bomber with a two-man crew, was based at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Plattsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, which is about 80 miles west of the crash site. The pilot was Capt. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voorhees </PERSON> and the navigator Capt. <PERSON> Len </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esterly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Sgt. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the <LOCATION> Plattsburgh </LOCATION> base. She said ages and hometowns were not immediately available. The two ejected in a a pod. A spruce tree branch broke through the capsule on impact, bruising <PERSON> Voorhees </PERSON> on the back of his knee, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>, 34, a former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sergeant who heard the crash and set out on snowshoes with a friend to find the two near his property. The two crew members were taken back to the base Thursday afternoon by helicopter. State police said the two airman walked a quarter of a mile from the crash to a farmhouse where they waited for a car that drove them to a designated clearing off Route 2 for the helicopter to pick them up. `` He seemed to be a lot calmer than I was when I found out about it,'' said Trooper <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Willey </PERSON> of his telephone conversation with the pilot. The FB-111 can carry nuclear and conventional weapons. The same type of plane was used in the 1986 raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The jet crashed in the town of <LOCATION> Kirby </LOCATION>, next to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johnsbury </LOCATION>, about 10 miles west of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> border. It went down in woods less than a mile from heavily traveled Route 2. <PERSON> Boog </PERSON> was driving on that road when `` out of the corner of my eye, I saw this jet flashing real low.'' `` The plane was not on fire,'' he said. <PERSON> Boog </PERSON> said he borrowed a snowmobile from a house and went to the crash site, but found the airmen gone. When he was told they were uninjured he returned the snowmobile. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Maroney </PERSON> was at her mother's when the plane crashed on her mother's property. `` It sounded just like a jet was flying real low but then there was this loud noise that I thought was a sonic boom. It was the crash,'' she said. `` I looked out the window and we could see flames and saw a parachute coming down.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Godbut </PERSON>, a state employee at <LOCATION> Cannon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> ski area, was in his front yard in neighboring <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, at 11:45 a.m. `` I heard an explosion, and I looked up in the air in the direction of the explosion,'' Godbut said. `` I could see a large giant puff ball of smoke, probably 300 to 400 feet across rising into the sky.'' The FB-111 can fly at more than twice the speed of sound and is a sweep-wing plane, which means it can change the angle of its wings to increase speed when traveling at supersonic speeds.

 In a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> courtroom, a judge is looking for that rarest of creatures _ the person who barely knows anything about <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. The judge selecting jurors to try <PERSON> North </PERSON> is making some progress, but the question arises: Will the jury that results be a cross-section of the community, capable of rendering an informed judgment? In the legal sense, it will be a jury of North's peers. The law only requires that it be a cross-section of citizens from which no one has been excluded by reason of sex, race or other arbitrary criteria. It need not be people comparable to North in any other way. What Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> seeks is a jury `` ignorant'' of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s activities _ people so removed from world affairs during the summer of 1987 that they were unaware that <PERSON> North </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had lied to it, believing his duty to his country required such deception.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is moving to limit political damage from an imminent 50 percent congressional pay raise by offering a follow-up vote to roll the increase back to 30 percent. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> floated the idea of a follow-up vote on Wednesday, as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members nervous about the reaction back home to the 50 percent raise told news media and public interest groups that they wanted a chance to reject it. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s office said results of a private survey of lawmakers could be released today, including whether members demanded a vote on the 50 percent raise that will become law next Wednesday unless both houses vote to stop it. Senators are virtually certain to vote today or Friday to turn down the proposal to raise congressional pay from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000. House leaders initially planned not to hold any vote, letting the increase become law, but there were signs that resolve was wavering on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 `` Columbo'' is back, but the first in a series of new two-hour movies, kicking off `` The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Monday Mystery Movie,'' sputters like that old <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> the rumpled detective drives. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> is back, but the plot seems to be a `` Murder, She Wrote'' episode stretched into two hours. Was the show always this dull? Did it just seem more interesting in the 1970s? The following week, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> also returns to the small screen in his share of the three-movie rotating wheel, `` B.L. Stryker.'' His show is a `` Miami Vice'' episode stretched into two hours, but <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is well-cast as a beer-swilling ex-cop who has come home to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> after losing his cool, and his badge, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. He's helped by some spunky writing and a fine supporting cast that includes <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, bless his heart, is so overjoyed to be back in his old raincoat, he overplays the part, shrugging, shuffling and flailing like <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with reporters shouting questions at him. He seems too conscious of the character. You know how little kids are unintentionally cute, but then they get older and start trying to be cute, and they're not? At least the producers knew not to mess with the formula, which is exactly the same. First we see the murder, then, silly us, we worry whether <PERSON> Columbo </PERSON> will figure it out. This is an open mystery _ the audience knows the answer but the hero does n't _ and they're difficult to write. In the premiere, the villain is a psychic, played by <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, who beheads a magician -LRB- <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerbe </PERSON> -RRB- who threatens to expose him as a fake. After about a 30-minute setup, we return from a commercial break to a darkened street. The familiar coughing car lumbers into the frame. Inside, a dark figure lights a cigar. Columbo! There's even an appropriate pause apparently designed so viewers can stand and applaud in their living rooms. From there on, though, the plot wears as thin as that raincoat that was once rumored to be hanging in the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. It actually has been in <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>'s closet. `` Columbo'' left the air in 1977, and <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> went on to a successful film career. He's enjoying himself in his old role, so who's to complain? There's a lot worse on network television. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, whose film career has waned in recent years, has found himself a nice little vehicle in `` B.L. Stryker.'' The B.L. stands for `` <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>.'' A pan of photos on his apartment wall reveals volumes about the ex-football player _ his wife's face is carefully cut out of his wedding picture. <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stryker </ORGANIZATION>'s oft-wed, gold-digging ex _ her most recent hubby is played by <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigoda </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is <PERSON> Stryker </PERSON>'s old friend <PERSON> Oz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The show is filmed on location in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and comes from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s production company _ <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON> is executive producer _ hence the same good-natured feel as `` Magnum, P.I.'' In the opener, <PERSON> Stryker </PERSON> is haunted by his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> past and a bizarre string of sex crimes in pricey <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. He tries to help the local cops while being hounded by a Aussie-sounding reporter from a supermarket tabloid. `` I always wanted to be on the cover of your magazine,'' <PERSON> Stryker </PERSON> tells him, `` right next to ` Hermaphrodite Gives Birth on Oprah Show.''' He falls for a psychiatrist -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Helen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shavers </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- called in by the cops and tries to impress her by taking her to dinner at a fancy restaurant. `` This is a nice place,'' she purrs. `` This is my hangout,'' he lies. `` I come here all the time.'' Enter maitre'd: `` Excuse me, monsieur. You have to wear a tie.'' After a predictable attack on a friend of <ORGANIZATION> Stryker </ORGANIZATION>'s, there's tragedy, and <PERSON> Stryker </PERSON> is left with a `` Vice'' - style ending, gazing into the sunset while the strains of <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s `` Fallen Angel'' rise up in the The biggest mystery here is how <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> ended up as <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>. The third movie in the wheel premieres later this month. `` <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>'' stars <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as an anthropologist who investigates mysteries involving strange cultures.

<HEAD>Arms Industry in Neutral Sweden Bracing for Difficulties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHAN RAPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MALMO, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For a small neutral country at peace for 175 years, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> makes a lot of weapons but its arms industry is worried about the future. The Swedes build their own jet fighters, naval crusiers and patrol boats, artillery, tanks and anti-tank guns, rifles, laser-guided missiles, explosives, radar _ enough weaponry to supply most of its needs. But the arms makers are worried because of cutbacks in Swedish military spending and escalating production costs. Companies are trimming production and talking about merging. `` It's been considered part of our security policy to produce weapons systems that are necessary to defend <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. But that policy has started to creak at the joints,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Palsson </PERSON>, president of the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Kockums </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>, which builds submarines. `` <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is too small a market to carry the arms industry it has. You have to get out and export.'' With a shrinking home market, pressure to export has prompted some big companies to evade regulations banning sales to countries at war or even to regions where conflict is likely. Two businessmen are on trial for illegal gunpowder exports. Four executives of <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>, the country's biggest arms producer, face prosecution on charges of selling weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> states. The country's military chief, <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cmdr </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafsson </PERSON>, has said defense policy may have to be redefined, unless the military gets more money. The defense network can no longer afford to keep the arms industry filled with orders, <PERSON> Gustafsson </PERSON> said. His gloomy reports on the state of the military have triggered one of the biggest defense debates here since World War II. `` It feels unreal to hear the Swedish military talk about more money at a time of international detente,'' said <PERSON> Maj-Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Theorin </PERSON>, a leading member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Dealing in weapons is a sensitive issue in a nation that champions world disarmament and where the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a peace-promoting group, has been active for 105 years. But defense has become closely linked to economic goals for <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s welfare state and a population of 8.5 million _ full employment, regional development and the well-being of the big companies. Companies at the heart of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s civilian export industry also are involved in arms production: _ Automaker <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> also builds airplanes _ <ORGANIZATION> Ericsson </ORGANIZATION>, the telecommunications giant, also makes sophisticated electronic military hardware Weapons makers employ 27,000 people, or almost 3 percent of the industrial work force. Arms exports account for less than 1 percent of total foreign business, but they bring enough to keep production lines going. The stakes are high in major projects like the development of a new multirole combat plane, the JAS 39 Gripen. The project, which already has consumed roughly $ 1.7 billion, is 18 months behind schedule. Estimates of the final cost _ around $ 7 billion _ are rising so fast that the plane risks being scrapped. <PERSON> Gustafsson </PERSON> told a news conference that the project could pay off in the long run, but he added that unless the military got more government money it might have to take the cheaper option and buy an American plane. <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnsund </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION>, said if the air force cancels the order, it could spell the end of the Swedish aviation industry. That would cost thousands of jobs, many of them in one-industry towns, he said. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has strict export laws that effectively rule out selling weapons to the countries that use them most. About 25 percent of total arms production, mainly ammunition and explosives, is exported, but few of the expensive weapon systems have been sold abroad. That will have to change if the arms industry is to survive, said <PERSON> Palsson </PERSON>, whose shipbuilders secured a $ 2.5 billion deal in 1987 to develop a submarine industry in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The Australian contract, including the sale of eight Swedish vessels, and the 1986 sale of $ 1.4 billion worth of artillery to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, were the two largest arms deals in Swedish history.

<HEAD>For Some, New Farm Opportunities Can Be Rather Exotic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers seem to always be looking for ways of adding to family income, sometimes by moonlighting in town, driving a school bus, or by setting up roadside stands to peddle seasonal produce. Sometimes a sideline can become a full-time business, one of the alternatives to traditional crops-and-livestock farming. These days it can include llamas, water buffalos, deer and ostriches. A two-day conference last week at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> concentrated on <ORGANIZATION> LISA </ORGANIZATION>, the acronym invented to describe `` low-input, sustainable agriculture.'' It means producing food by using more sense and less chemicals. Mostly, the meetings included case histories of farmers who have learned or are trying to learn how to reduce expenses by using less fertilizer, pesticides and other `` inputs'' while making a living and improving their land. The <ORGANIZATION> LISA </ORGANIZATION> program is part of an overall thrust by the government, including legislation and $ 3.9 million provided by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to help farmers _ large and small _ look at alternative systems for producing crops and livestock. One of the components is the Office for <ORGANIZATION> Small-Scale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, which is operated by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. For some time, the office has been grinding out one-sheet reports about the alternatives available to small producers. Some of the previous topics include sheep, goats, mushrooms, foliage plants, herbs, wildflowers and specialty vegetables. The latest one-sheeter, prepared by editor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>, is `` Exotic Livestock.'' And the report begins by asking about beefalo, the crossbred critter of beef and buffalo origins that stirred imaginations a few years back. `` Where's the beefalo? It's still around, but the excitement is gone,'' the report said. `` Such a query arises because introduction of exotic types of creatures into a country where they are scarce encourages speculators to bid prices extremely high.'' In that case, breeding stock becomes the focus rather than the basic use of the animal for meat, work, hide, fur or feathers. But American consumers, affluent and with sometimes incredible appetites for exotic menu items, can exert powerful influence. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s agency that oversees inspection of meat and poultry, has changed its rules to include reindeer, elk, antelope, water buffalo and deer as `` exotic'' animals Previously, the agency's exotic list included only American bison, or buffalo, and cattalo or beefalo. Officials say fewer than 2,000 `` exotic'' animals are slaughtered annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with more than 32 million cattle each year. But because of rising demand from restaurants, small-scale producers of exotic animals are finding it profitable to market federally inspected meat from certain species, the report said. Meanwhile, there has been a growing demand for other exotic animals, and sometimes the prices are sky-high. `` For the moment, the biggest dollar demand is for such exotics as ostriches and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> humpless camels such as llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas,'' the report said. `` Little demand is noted for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s yaks or musk oxen.'' According to a quarterly publication, <ORGANIZATION> Llama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, in 1987 a company called <ORGANIZATION> Camelids </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sold 52 male and female llamas at an estimated cost of more than $ 1 million. One buyer paid $ 100,000 each for two breeding males. `` Some people predict that 3,500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> owners of 12,000 llamas will begin to price themselves out of the market, even if camelid wool is sought by handspinners and weavers, and the pack animals are used in sorts of fund-raising events,'' the report said. <PERSON> Llamas </PERSON>, fabled pack animals in the Andes of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, are often used for that purpose by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> when venturing into wilderness areas because they are less intrusive on the environment than horses and mules. Unlike llamas, water buffalos are n't in great demand, the report said. But there has been commercial herd development in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1978. There are two types, both used for work and meat: the swamp buffalo, or carabao, which is rarely used for milk, and the river buffalo, which is noted for its milk. Breeds of the river buffalo are commonly found in the temperate climates of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, some areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and in cold, mountainous areas of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> countries are beginning to catch on to their value,'' the report said. `` About 18 different breeds of both types can work in tropical mud that can bog down a tractor. One of these animals can work as many as 20 years.'' The European fallow deer is another farming possibility on the exotic side. Currently, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restaurants import 500 to 1,000 tons of venison annually, mostly from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. But a problem with deer and elk is that a fence about seven feet high is needed to keep the animals under control, a major expense in getting started. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has about 2,000 deer farms, still imports more than 20,000 tons of venison annually, the report said. If large poultry is preferred, try ostriches. There are several ostrich ranches in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, dating back to 1981, the report said. Pairs of breeding size adults bring $ 12,000 to $ 30,000 each, depending on age and quality. Chicks at last report cost $ 1,000 each at eight weeks, when sex can be distinguished.

 It's a story fit for the movies. Two of this country's greatest inventors, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>, got together one day to discuss the motion picture industry they were helping create. Eastman already had invented the process to make long rolls of film and <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> had patented his movie camera. Both were comparing notes and seeking refinements. At one point, Eastman, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, supposedly asked <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> how wide the camera film should be. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>, holding thumb and forefinger about an inch apart, said, `` About so wide.'' That width, 1 -RRB- inches, better known as 35mm, became and remains the standard size for the black celluloid that's been used for a century to hold the dramas, comedies and happy endings that appear on the silver screen. Who knows if the story is true. It's been told so many times, altered and edited, that it's impossible to determine exactly when or even if the conversation occurred, said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON>. `` You just have to say, ` Legend has it ...,''' <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said. This year <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is celebrating its 100th anniversary making movie film, which in terms of miles manufactured is the photo giant's leading film product `` 1889 is the year we sold our first length of motion picture film _ to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON>, that much we're sure of,'' <PERSON> Kaska </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> opened a production company and released 5,000 movie titles _ shorts of vaudeville acts or boxing matches _ by 1900. He is credited with starting the entertainment form. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> always has maintained a subtle role in the movie business, supplying generations of filmmakers, from pioneers like <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMille </PERSON> to today's kingpins like <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>. For many years, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> was the only practical supplier of film to the burgeoning industry and today the company still dominates. Its low profile dates to the days of Eastman, who refused to enter the movie production business and insisted on accepting cash in advance for movie film, never a share of profits. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> did n't trust filmmakers. If a film lost money, he did n't want to lose with it,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Horak </PERSON>, curator of film at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photography </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is based. Moviemakers constantly visited the company offering a percentage of their profits to <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for free film, but always have been rejected. That policy remains in effect. <PERSON> Horak </PERSON> said the no-free-film rule also applies to a <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> program that supports young filmmakers who ca n't afford to buy film. `` They give them money and tell them to buy the film,'' <PERSON> Horak </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s movie division also maintains a low profile within the company because the division generates about $ 350 million a year in sales, a fraction of the company's $ 17 billion in annual sales. Nonetheless, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> remains the overwhelming favorite among moviemakers worldwide, said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, associate editor of American Cinematographer. The magazine, published by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinematographers </ORGANIZATION>, has been interviewing moviemakers for 70 years and nearly all have said they use <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> film. `` We do 12 issues a year and talk to at least three cinematographers in each issue. I would say we usually find one or two that do n't use <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> film. In 1988, we did n't have anyone,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Horak </PERSON> said without <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1900s, there would n't have been a thriving movie business. Today <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is by far the leading seller of all movie film in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, although <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photofilm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Agfa-Gevaert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, have started winning acceptance. `` The foreign film has gained in quality over the past couple of years and as a result I think more people are starting to think about using it,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Deluxe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. DeLuxe printed about half of all the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movies last year, and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said about 80 percent of the film it uses is Kodak-made <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Agfa </ORGANIZATION> films are attractive, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said, because a studio can usually get a discount by buying a certain amount of film, a practice <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> refuses to offer. So, while filmmakers may insist on using <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> film to shoot movies, a studio may insist on another film to make the 1,000 copies sent to movie theaters worldwide. `` More and more over the years, it's the bottom line that counts,'' said <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. There are primarily two kinds of movie film: negative film, used in the camera when a movie is shot; and print film, which runs through a theater screen projector. The moviemaking process is identical to taking camera photographs, involving a negative converted to a print. The average movie, at 90 feet of film a minute, is about about 90,000 to 120,000 feet long. However, much more is used en route to the final product. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> estimates filmmakers use at least 20 times more negative film than the finished product requires, which means an average movie might use 1.8 million feet of film. If 1,000 prints are needed, a studio must buy 90 million feet of print film. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> sells its most popular negative film in a 400-foot roll priced at about 34 cents a foot. Its most popular print film comes in a 4,000-foot roll costing about 6 cents a foot. <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> sells its most versatile negative film for about 31 cents a foot. Increased competition may be one reason <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is blowing its horn about its long history in movies. Although the company has won five Oscars, three Emmys and two special scientific awards for technical breakthroughs in the movie industry, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> still feels a little taken for granted, company officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s role in the movie business is not unlike <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s or <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s role in the automobile industry, said <PERSON> Joerge </PERSON> <PERSON> Agin </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s Motion Picture and Audiovisual Products Division.

 The government reported its chief economic forecasting gauge posted a strong 0.6 percent gain in December, continuing a seesaw pattern that some analysts said portends slower growth this year. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has reversed course in each of the last nine months, showing little forward momentum. December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967 base of 100, up a slim 2 percent from the same month a year earlier, the government said Wednesday. The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowest quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the October-December period, when the increase in the gross national product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent.

 Construction spending, depressed by a downturn in work on apartment buildings, rose just 1.1 percent last year, the weakest showing since the recession year of 1982, the government said. The year ended on a strong note, however, as construction spending rose 2.5 percent in December, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Spending for all of 1988 totaled $ 403.4 billion, a slim increase from $ 398.9 billion in the previous year. But after taking into account inflation, spending actually was down 0.4 percent from 1987.

 The government agency that investigated the mammoth <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> securities fraud case wo n't see a penny of a record $ 650 million settlement. In fact, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ considered chronically understaffed and underfunded _ is n't even allowed to spend the money it raises through routine stock licensing fees, which amounted to twice its budget last year. To put it in perspective, the government agency assigned to investigate financial institutions where hundreds of millions of dollars change handsdaily has a budget of $ 142.6 million this year. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bands are getting $ 167.5 million. `` It does n't hamstring you; you just ca n't get to the work,'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who was the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement director from 1974-81, said Wednesday of the agency's budget woes. `` I did n't believe we were seeing even 10 percent of the wrongdoing that was out there and I think that remains the fact today,'' <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON> said. With the government pledging to increase firepower against securities fraud in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case and a commodities probe in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, many officials want to see the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> receive more funding, possibly by retaining some of its securities-licensing fees. `` The problem at the moment is that over the last two to three years we got involved in some important investigations _ cases like <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> _ which required the devotion of our resources,'' current <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Enforcement Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. `` Obviously we're not going to take staff away from ongoing litigation. But right now we are getting hurt.'' The three Wall Street fraud cases <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> mentioned all produced huge settlements. Under <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s plea agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> made public last month, the investment giant must pay $ 300 million in criminal fines and civil penalties. The remaining $ 350 million is to be placed in an escrow account to cover payments to investors who may sue to recover losses from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s actions. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, an ex-Drexel managing director, in June 1986 agreed to repay $ 11.6 million in illegal gains from insider trading, the use of nonpublic information to profit in stock transactions. Cooperation by <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned speculator who in November 1986 agreed to pay $ 100 million in insider trading penalties. In fiscal 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> obtained court orders for defendants to return about $ 121 million in illicit profits. More than $ 70 million of that came from insider trading cases. Another $ 62.6 million was ordered in civil penalties for insider trading. No one publicly has suggested allowing the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to use the money it rakes in for government coffers, which would make the agency something like a meter maid for securities investigations. `` It's a real problem because you do n't want the agency that is going to be using the fines to have an incentive to fine people,'' said <PERSON> Sporkin </PERSON>, the federal judge. Under longstanding guidelines, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has required violators of federal securities laws to `` disgorge,'' or return, illicit profits. As the number of insider trading cases grew, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pressed for and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, which empowered the commission to seek court-ordered fines in addition to disgorgement. Some investigators also want the commission to be able to levy fines for relatively minor infractions, rather than just being able to suspend guilty brokers. Under current guidelines, only judges in civil and criminal cases can fine securities-law violators. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 142.6 million budget for fiscal 1989 is up from $ 135.2 million last year. Revenue from securities-registration fees for the year is projected at $ 252 million, but as with penalties, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> ca n't spend a cent of it. That's where change is expected. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> in December proposed that the commission adopt some form of self-funding, such as retaining part of its fees. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> may have allowed some investigations _ including enforcement of fraud in `` penny stocks,'' which are traded over-the-counter for a few dollars or less _ to slip because of underfunding and understaffing. `` Given the current inadequacies of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s resources, -LRB- self-funding -RRB- makes admirable good sense and I'll be working toward that end,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday A recent <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> report said the annual turnover rate for staff attorneys is 20 percent and that half of <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers have less than three years' experience. The starting salary for commission lawyers is $ 27,172. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorkin </PERSON>, a former head of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said bureau staffing there fell to 185 in September 1986 from 225 in November 1980 _ the same period during which the stock market surged and insider trading scandals were exposed. With more staff, he said, `` You'll have more cases, you'll have more ability to police the industry. Surely it would help.''

 A small manufacturer of soybean products has pulled off a coup of sorts by getting a major supermarket chain, <ORGANIZATION> Waldbaum </ORGANIZATION>'s Foodmart, to make room in some of its dairy cases for fresh soy milk. The <ORGANIZATION> Ambrosia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> does not expect consumers to immediately begin gulping down its SweetSoy soy milk, but owner <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Appel </PERSON> says a major hurdle has been cleared just by getting the cholesterol-and lactose-free product a place next to cow's milk. `` It's very exciting. I still ca n't figure out how we did it,'' said <PERSON> Appel </PERSON>, 35, who was a senior consultant for a Big Eight accounting firm before opening her soybean product business in 1987. <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON>'s, a <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>, Mass.-based company, will begin carrying the product this month on a trial basis at stores in several <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> locations, a spokesman said. <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON>'s has 43 stores in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` We try to be first with those items that potentially indicate new trends. Even if it sold marginally we would possibly expand it because of its uniqueness,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON>, dairy buyer-merchandiser for <ORGANIZATION> Waldbaum </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON>'s is believed to be the first major supermarket chain on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to carry fresh soy milk in its dairy section, according to <PERSON> Appel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goblitz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Soyatech </ORGANIZATION>, a market research firm in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> that follows the soybean industry. <PERSON> Goblitz </PERSON> said Ambrosia's accomplishment is significant in two respects: The company has managed to get a major supermarket chain to sell fresh soy milk and also to put it in the dairy counter. `` For soy milk to reach the mainstream market it is going to have to entice the people who look in the dairy case regularly,'' <PERSON> Goblitz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goblitz </PERSON> said he will be interested in seeing how the supermarket-shopping public takes to the product and how dairy companies respond. `` By being in there she is taking over someone else's turf,'' he said. <PERSON> Lucey </PERSON> said he expected the product's main appeal will be to those who drink skim milk or no milk at all. `` I think it is a completely different customer. I do n't really think its any threat -LRB- to the dairy industry -RRB-,'' he said. Still, the dairy industry is likely to keep a close eye on the development, <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, the former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s dairy committee, said Wednesday. Most of the soy milk sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is packaged in aseptic containers that do not require refrigeration and have long shelf lives. Health food and Asian-American stores account for probably 95 percent of all sales, <PERSON> Goblitz </PERSON> said. Some people may not like the taste of soy milk at first, <PERSON> Appel </PERSON> acknowledged Tuesday. She says it has a slightly nutty flavor, but others say the description is generous, describing it as bland and watery. `` We are definitely going to have to do an educational program,'' said <PERSON> Appel </PERSON>. Her company will provide in-store sampling of soy milk next month. Soy milk may be put on cereal, used in recipes or sipped by the glassful just like dairy milk, <PERSON> Appel </PERSON> said. Sales of soy milk, which is about three times more expensive than dairy milk, have increased 425 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1983, or up to 4.6 million gallons last year, according to <PERSON> Goblitz </PERSON>. In most of the products, oil is added to create a better flavor and better `` mouth feel,'' <PERSON> Goblitz </PERSON> said. A sweetener is also usually added. <PERSON> Waldbaum </PERSON>'s will be carrying Ambrosia's chocolate and vanilla soy milk as well as the company's plain product, which is made only of soybean, soy lecithin and water, <PERSON> Appel </PERSON> said. Ambrosia buys organically grown soybeans from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, soy milk is so commonplace it is sold in vending machines, <PERSON> Appel </PERSON> noted. `` We want to be the soy milkman of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' she said.

 A special <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> panel has appointed a futures regulation expert to help examine possible changes in trading practices now under scrutiny in a federal fraud investigation. The nine-member <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Review Trading Practices appointed <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilmouth </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, to assist in the review of trading procedure and policy, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said after the panel held its first meeting Wednesday. The futures association is the industry's self-regulatory organization. The federal government is investigating allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars through illegal trading practices. The ongoing two-year probe was disclosed two weeks ago. Proposals for changes at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> are expected in two to three months. The proposals would then be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency that regulates the industry, for approval, <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> said. Reporters were not allowed into Wednesday's meeting, described by <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON> as the first in a series planned in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss trading rules and procedures. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> was to vote in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today on implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> electronic trading system, a key element in the exchange's move to set up after-hours global futures trading. Electronic trading also is seen by some as a way to help police improper activity by more closely monitoring deals. The commission's staff has recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> be approved, despite criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> that computerized trading opens the industry to hackers and does not eliminate fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday designated Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., to direct a congressional investigation into trading practices in the futures and options markets English, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural development, said the probe would focus on the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s regulation of the markets and on the self-regulating ability of the markets themselves. In establishing the special panel at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> last week, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the exchange's executive committee, said there would be `` no sacred cows'' in the examination of trading practices in the market. Among the practices that will come under scrutiny is dual trading, <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said, in which traders can buy and sell for themselves and a customer simultaneously. Critics say the longtime practice invites abuse of the traditional open-outcry style of commodities trading. ABS Partners, the most powerful group of brokers in the exchange, has banned the practice to avoid `` an appearance of conflict of interest,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. There is some support among traders for elimination of dual trading. `` It's a conflict of interest. It's me before the customer, and I do n't think it's right,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikora </PERSON>, who trades for <ORGANIZATION> Henning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Krajewski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based commodities brokerage. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> are also examining trading practices. Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> told traders this week the exchange is considering eliminating dual trading, and is exploring the feasibility of electronic trading.

<HEAD>Malaysian Group Places Ad To Rebut Charges On Palm Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Malaysian trade group has begun an advertising campaign in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aimed at countering what it calls scare tactics of competitors and health advocates who say palm oil leads to heart disease. The <ORGANIZATION> Malaysian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>' Council today placed a full page advertisement headlined, `` To the American People _ The <ORGANIZATION> Facts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> About </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>,'' in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Initial scientific research has provided evidence that palm oil is healthy and nutritious,'' the ad said in part. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s primary industries minister, <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Keng </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaik </PERSON>, announced last week that the palm oil producers in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> had set up a $ 3.69 million fund for a counterattack. `` Since we are the world's biggest producer and exporter of palm oil we can not let this go unchallenged. We have to nail the lie,'' <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> said. He said the campaign would include advertisements in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers refuting studies that found highly saturated tropical oils, like palm and coconut, increase blood cholesterol and lead to heart disease. Groups like the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soybean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> began an anti-palm oil campaign in 1987, and major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food processors such as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have responded with announcements that they no longer use tropical oils in their cookies, crackers and other products.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to allow <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to export 25.5 million knitted garments to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> this year, the largest quota granted any supplier, a textile trade group said Thursday. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, previously the largest supplier of knitted garments to the 12-nation trading bloc, was given a quota of 25.32 million pieces, said <PERSON> Chamrul </PERSON> <PERSON> Djafri </PERSON>, an executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Indonesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The quota agreement was reached in a three-day meeting that ended here Wednesday. It was the first time the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had set a limit for Indonesian exports of knitted garments, including men's shirts, T-shirts and underwear. `` Sharp increases over the past few years in its imports of the products from <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> prompted the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to impose the quota this year,'' <PERSON> Djafri </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s exports of knitted garments to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> jumped from 1.2 million pieces in 1984 to 12.1 million in 1987. As of September, 1988 exports had reached 18.8 million pieces.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has developed a tiny new transistor that can be used to build smaller, speedier computers and provide clearer pictures on television sets. The new `` quantum wire transistor'' uses wires one-tenth the thickness of conventional transistors, and can be used to perform calculations at six times the speed possible with existing high electron mobility transistors, said an <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Many transistors go into a computer, and the spokesman said the small size of the new type would permit the development of laptop high-speed computers. He said the transistor uses wires 5 nanometers thick. One nanometer equals one-millionth of a millimeter, he added. He said the transistor also could be used to develop more sophisticated amplifiers for receiving broadcast waves from satellites and other objects in space. This would help provide clearer pictures on television sets. Development of quantum wire transistors is also going on elsewhere in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The stock market edged upward today, bidding to resume its early-1989 rally after a pause on Wednesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .36 to 2,338.57 in the first half hour.

Analysts said money managers at investing institutions still seemed to be doing some catch-up buying to try to participate in the market's rally.

 The General Accounting Office today recommended that the government deal with the savings and loan crisis by promptly taking control of all failed institutions. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional auditing and investigative agency, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that regulators should place any of the 350 insolvent institutions remaining open into receivership whenever necessary until a decision can be made to liquidate them or merge them with stronger partners. `` Of fundamental importance, these institutions must be effectively isolated from the rest of the depository institutions industry to prevent them from competing with healthy institutions,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. `` Their operations must be limited to investing in high-grade securities, managing bad assets on their books and accepting deposits at prevailing market rates,'' he said. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said S & amp; L regulators should enlist help from state officials and from federal regulators of commercial banks to accomplish this task. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must reach agreement as soon as possible on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis, or this process could not get started. `` We estimate that to fully pay for -LRB- deposit -RRB- insurance losses and to put -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- back on a solid financial footing, it will cost at least $ 85 billion more than <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> currently anticipates receiving in revenue over the next 10 years,'' he said. `` Delay will only increase this cost,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. Delay would also permit weak institutions to `` squander our nation's wealth on questionable economic endeavors,'' weaken the entire financial system because healthy institutions must match the high interest rates paid by weak thrifts, and create pressure on regulators to lower standards for the entire industry to accommodate weak S & amp; Ls, he said. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> also said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, while providing more money, should also reform the system and improve its methods of rescuing failed S & amp; Ls. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> should be made independent of its parent agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, and that healthy and unhealthy S & amp; Ls should be put into separate insurance funds so that tougher rules can fairly be applied to the good S & amp; Ls right away. <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, whose agency is studying last year's rescue of 205 S & amp; Ls at an estimated cost of $ 31 billion, said, `` We have serious reservations about the way the bank board proceeded.'' He said the bank board relies too heavily on methods that preserve cash and spread the cost of any rescues over 10 years. `` It is questionable whether many of these mergers really save the government money compared to other options that would be possible if <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> had the money to resolve cases,'' he said.

<HEAD>Index Up in December but Economists Still See Slower Growth</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with five grafs to UPDATE with home sales report. Picks
up 2nd graf pvs, The Index ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of new homes increased 0.6 percent in December, while sales for the whole year rebounded slightly after plunging during 1987, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said 1988 sales totaled 677,000 units, up 0.9 percent from the 671,000 sold during the previous year. Last year's level was the highest since 750,000 homes were sold in 1986. Home sales had plunged 10.5 percent in 1987, with the decrease blamed on higher mortgage interest rates and a slowdown in demand after five strong sales years. December's increase pushed the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate to 669,000 for the month, up from 665,000 in November when sales had been down 7.9 percent. On Wednesday, the government reported that its chief economic forecasting gauge posted a strong 0.6 percent gain in December, continuing a seesaw pattern that some analysts said portends slower growth in 1989. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has reversed course in each of the last nine months, showing little forward momentum. December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967 base of 100, up a slim 2 percent from the same month a year earlier. Economists welcomed Wednesday's report from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as a precursor to slower, more sustainable growth during the economic expansion's seventh year, saying restraint would help keep inflation in check without threatening a serious downturn. Wall Street was unimpressed by the report, however, as stocks turned in a mixed showing. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 4.11 points to 2,338.21. In another report Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending shot up 2.5 percent in December to end a weak year on a strong note. Construction spending for all of 1988 totaled $ 403.4 billion, up just 1.1 percent from 1987. Taking inflation into account, spending actually was down 0.4 percent. It was the slowest performance since the recession year of 1982. `` The economy is going to be slowing down but there is no recession on the horizon,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> predicted that by the middle of next year, growth would slow enough for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to ease its tight grip on the money supply. Since March, the central bank has been pushing up interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic growth. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>., said the report's saw-toothed performance `` tells you that there is not a boom building It suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the next couple of quarters but it most assuredly does not point to any kind of a recession.'' The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowest quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the October-December period, when the increase in the gross national product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to adopt his predecessor's forecast that the economy will grow at a 3.2 percent rate in 1989, but many private economists are making more pessimistic predictions for the coming year.

He noted as recent examples beef, citrus and processed food exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, tobacco to several <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, and almonds to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` But it is a whole lot more efficient, less time-consuming and less confrontational to do this multilaterally'' through trade negotiations,'' he said. `` That should be a high priority for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> as well as for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative and it has implications for the 1990 farm bill. `` We simply can not rationally construct farm legislation for the'90s until we know the outcome of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round'' of trade talks, he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> noted that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, during his campaign, said the 1985 farm bill has done what it was expected to do in regard to farm income supports. `` But <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture is changing constantly,'' he told the committee. `` And the institutional regime that is appropriate for today may well be inappropriate five years from now. `` I will ask our <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> professionals for a comprehensive evaluation of existing programs preparatory to submitting recommendations for policy adjustments in the future, and we will obviously also seek the views of our agricultural community.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also said rural development will occupy a large portion of his time. Last year's drought, he said, has led many in rural areas to contemplate their future and in so doing they have realized that they have become too dependent on agriculture. `` They need to diversify their economic base,'' he said, adding that he would be working toward that goal. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported, meanwhile, that <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was guest of honor at an inaugural-week reception costing thousands of dollars paid by the tobacco, food and brewing conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> aggressively promoted American tobacco products overseas as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, and agriculture secretary he would be responsible for policies directly affecting <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> business interests <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> did not check with government ethics officers before agreeing to the reception, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Executive branch ethics rules say an official can not accept anything of value from anyone whose interests could be affected by the official's public duties. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the trade office, said that when the idea arose <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was planning to leave the government and the reception `` was viewed as a thank you for his efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry at large while he was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative.'' <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON> said the company held the event for <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> because it `` thought it would be nice and appropriate to celebrate the selection of an eminently qualified man'' as agriculture secretary. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics, told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> should have checked with the trade office's ethics officer before agreeing to be feted by the company. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> `` considered such approval unnecessary in light of his imminent departure'' from the trade office.

 Wheat futures prices were slightly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> but corn, soybean and oat futures slipped on ideas that wintry weather in the Corn Belt will prove beneficial to farmers. `` It's been dry all winter but now we're seeing a switch to more winterlike conditions with more precipitation in the form of snow, and that tends to mean this spring will be better for the crops,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Showers in northern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest soybean producer, also weighed on the soybean market, analysts said But less snow has fallen this week in some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter-wheat areas than many experts had expected, and that helped support the wheat market this morning. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.32 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.72 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 2.16 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.65 -LCB- a bushel Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Tenneco's Fourth-Quarter Earnings Rebound From Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings rebounded from a loss a year ago, helped largely by an $ 867 million gain from the sale of its oil and gas businesses. For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, the diversified industrial company reported its net income totaled $ 598 million, or $ 4.23 a share, compared with a loss of $ 176 million, or 1.26 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1987. Revenue was $ 3.6 billion, compared with $ 3.2 billion a year earlier. For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>'s net income was $ 822 million, or $ 5.48 a share, compared with a $ 218 million, or $ 1.81-a-share, loss in 1987. Revenue totaled $ 13.2 billion compared with $ 11.94 billion in 1987. `` During 1988 we made fundamental changes in the focus and structure of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> was the nation's 10th-largest oil company before its 1988 sale. <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said the company used the proceeds of the oil and gas sale to repurchase more than 20 million shares of common stock for about $ 1 billion and reduce the company's debt by about $ 5 billion. `` These changes, combined with substantial divisional and corporate headquarters restructuring and cost reduction activity during 1988, have put <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> in an excellent position to achieve significant improvements in operating results in 1989,'' <PERSON> Ketelsen </PERSON> said. The remaining assets of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> include oil and gas pipelines, farm and ranch equipment, automotive parts, shipbuilding, packaging chemicals and minerals.

 A non-Indian contractor seeking business reserved for Indians on the Navajo reservation in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee today that he provided free airplane rides, an unrepaid $ 35,000 loan and other favors to the tribe's chairman. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paddock </PERSON> said he originally offered to lend his construction company's plane and pilot to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, chairman of the nation's largest <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> tribe, when <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was seeking re-election to his post in 1986. He said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> used the plane for about 35 trips, including many after his November 1986 election victory, including two flights to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Paddock's construction company had been declared ineligible for jobs reserved for Indians on the reservation by <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Zah </PERSON>, who had ousted <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> as chairman in 1982. Paddock said by supplying <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> with the plane he hoped `` that we'd be able to bid on contracts.'' He told a special panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs that has been investigating corruption in programs designed for Indians that the flights cost him $ 12,000 in expenses for pilots and fuel. The trips would have been worth about $ 60,000 commercially, he said. <PERSON> Paddock </PERSON> also told the committee that in December 1987, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> asked him for a $ 35,000 loan. He said he could n't refuse the request since as a contractor doing work on the reservation the tribe had his financial statements and `` I would have had a hard time telling him I was broke.'' He said the loan, which was to be for one year, was never repaid. <PERSON> Paddock </PERSON> testified that he paid for many of the expenses for the trips to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> that he made with <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, their wives and others. He said he also lent a company car to <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, and paid a $ 400 bill he received for use of the vehicle's telephone. He said he also paid $ 2,500 for a birthday party for <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>, and was later reimbursed for half of the expenses of the party <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has denied he has acted improperly as leader of the Navajo nation. <PERSON> Paddock </PERSON> testified that he set up a company called <ORGANIZATION> Native </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, headed by a friend, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who was a full-blooded Navajo, `` to allow us to bid on the preference work for Indians.'' On Wednesday, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official convicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigative panel that a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> company received multimillion-dollar government contracts on the strength of a shaky claim to native American ownership. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Program, said he counseled companies seeking contracts under the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s minority set-aside program. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was an Indian front company controlled by wealthy businessmen, including some with connections to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor whose top officials pleaded guilty to bribing government officials to get contracts. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> affair and is cooperating with the government in cases related to <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> contractors. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel went into closed session Wednesday to hear <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>' testimony, which was then summarized in a statement released by the committee staff. The statement did not identify the businessmen <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said had connections with both <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION>, and committee staff would not elaborate. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> installed a man named <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> as head of the company to win admittance to the minority program, claiming he was an Indian even though he was not enrolled in any Indian tribe until 1982. <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> received minority certification and then won multimillion-dollar ammunition contracts, <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said he had never seen a start-up company supported by so many government loans. He claimed that <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION> used influential political ties to gain <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> approval. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., who chairs the special panel, said this week's hearings into Indian set-asides have found problems common to the entire <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> minority preference program `` The committee has discovered certain patterns of abuses common to <ORGANIZATION> Kinross </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and other -LRB- minority qualifying -RRB- companies,'' he said. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Kraig </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Shawnee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> told the panel that the government's policy of requiring companies to have 51 percent Indian ownership to win Indian-related contracts is `` an invitation for fraud and fronts.'' <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, who served a prison term after pleading guilty in 1985 to charges related to bribing a <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> tribe governor, said contracting now `` is in a shambles.'' He said that to participate in bidding for Indian-related government contracts, he made an employee's wife who had an Indian relative in her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company. He also said his practice of giving <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> officials gifts ranging from dinner hams to automobiles was standard procedure among those seeking construction contracts on lands of the <ORGANIZATION> Absentee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shawnee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Chickasaw </LOCATION> tribes. He said he was unable to obtain contracts legitimately and soon resorted to gifts, gratuities and `` in some cases some serious bribes.'' The committee began its hearings into corruption in <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> affairs Monday and has been concentrating on the `` front'' operations. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Asbra </PERSON>, chief of the contracting division of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, testified that the agency does not check contractors' declarations that they are majority Indian-owned. He said it is up to Indians to police themselves and that they can complain to the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> if they believe business that is supposed to go to native Americans is going to non-Indians. `` We do n't have the capacity to inspect fronts,'' said <PERSON> Asbra </PERSON>.

 Times were so tough for <PERSON> Monika </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogguess </PERSON> when she and her husband relocated to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, that she got a paper route and once sold blood to pay the bills. Since winning the state's $ 1.35 million lottery jackpot last spring Mrs. <PERSON> Bogguess </PERSON>, 38, does n't worry about making ends meet. Now she has a new set of financial problems: how to invest a windfall when you do n't know the difference between a stock certificate and a gift certificate. `` I find it all very complicated,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bogguess </PERSON>, who has since quit working as a newspaper carrier. `` Even though I used to deliver the Wall Street Journal I do n't know how to read it.'' Winning the lottery jackpot can be sweet dream but the temptations and mysteries of new-found wealth often become overwhelming. Many prize recipients such as Mrs. <PERSON> Bogguess </PERSON> are plunged into the investment world blind. They're inundated with offers from financial brokers and a few fall prey to peddlers of bogus investments. State lottery officials do n't provide financial advice after all the hoopla dies down, except to sometimes explain tax liabilities and urge winners to hire a good accountant. `` The pressures of winning can be enormous,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Naste </PERSON>, an independent financial planner from <LOCATION> Baldwin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and a $ 2.5 million lottery winner himself. `` People label you a millionaire and expect you to live a certain way,'' he said. `` If you're not careful you can overextend yourself and end up in debt.'' That's what happened to a construction worker who won $ 4 million in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lottery three years ago and became one of Naste's three dozen jackpot-winning clients After receiving a check for around $ 148,000 _ the first of 20 annual after-tax installments _ the middle-aged man quit his $ 38,000-a-year job, threw a party and put $ 10,000 down on each of 10 new Cadillacs. `` The only problem was he did n't realize he also needed money to live on for the year,'' Naste said. In the next eight months, six of the luxury cars were repossessed and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> man had to borrow $ 200,000 to hold him over in between lottery checks. `` A lot of people who play the lottery are not used to having money, so some of them do crazy things,'' said <PERSON> Naste </PERSON>, 37, who puts most of his winnings in real estate. `` You've got to remember you're not really a millionaire when you first win The money comes in over 20 years. `` People say, ` If I win the lottery I'll buy a baseball team.' They've got to be kidding. Banks wo n't even loan you money based on -LRB- future -RRB- lottery winnings.'' Most big-lottery winners, though, are fairly conservative, according to interviews with winners, financial advisers and officials among the 32 state lotteries nationwide. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> found in a survey two years ago that nearly three quarters of its $ 1 million-plus lottery winners had sought expert financial advice. The majority used their first check to pay bills or splurge on a new home or car, but later, most made long-term investments, saved for retirement, or established trust funds, the survey showed. Mrs. <PERSON> Bogguess </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 42, are among those whom accountants might call conservative. While she quit her job, he kept working as a municipal sewage-management official in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, where they moved three years ago from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. The Bogguess' first $ 54,000 lottery check _ nearly double their pre-lottery annual income _ was partly used to pay off some credit-card debts, the $ 12,000 family jeep and buy a new pickup truck. Mrs. <PERSON> Bogguess </PERSON> put the rest in a two-year certificate of deposit and says she'll commit at least $ 20,000 a year to still-undetermined long-term investments. `` I'm trying to invest it wisely. I never had that much before and a couple of times I was down on hard times,'' she said, recalling the time she sold blood plasma to a local clinic for $ 30 a week. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flowers </PERSON>, an assistant high school principal from <LOCATION> Barboursville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, has followed a similar play-it-safe pattern after winning $ 2 million in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> lottery in the spring of 1986 Flowers, 40, who continues working but whose wife quit her job, said most of his first lottery check went toward buying a new house. On his accountant's advice, 10 percent was placed in a tax-deferred retirement annuity and another 10 percent was reserved for his three children's college education. A small amount was invested in mutual funds and short-term tax-free municipal bonds. Flowers, like some other lottery winners interviewed, has avoided stocks. `` This has raised our overall standard of living and lowered our overall worry level,'' said Flowers. Most prize recipients say their main goal is maintaining a higher living standard, long after the lottery checks cease. Tax expert <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Feola </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaccetti </PERSON>, who has counseled lottery winners, says that can easily be done through diversified investments. But her first advice is that clients take things slow. `` It's the same thing as with someone who inherits a lot of money,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Scaccetti </PERSON>, a tax partner with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horwath </ORGANIZATION>. `` You usually try to slow the pace down, apply all the sound financial decison proccess ... as you would a wealthy individual who has earned money over a period of time.'' For the first two years most lottery winners might want to keep the money in high-yielding CDs or <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, Ms. <PERSON> Scaccetti </PERSON> said. Some banks, such as <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, offer special accounts for clients who suddenly have $ 1 million or more and need a place to park it. Of course, lottery winners also should be looking for ways to shelter themselves from taxes, such as tax-free municipal bonds or annuities, Ms. <PERSON> Scaccetti </PERSON> said. Later on, `` They need to ask themselves: ` Do I need to have a fixed return because I want to give up working, or do I want to continue working and put a fixed income amount set aside,'' she said. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, 39, a former <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> producer from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, fell in both categories after winning $ 9.76 million in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lottery a year ago. Although his annual net income of $ 500,000 has kept himself and his wife out of the work force, they've been cautious. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> opted for investments most likely to appreciate, like a new $ 425,000, 3-bedroom house and a 1964 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud III. For tax reasons <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> obtained a 15-year home mortgage rather than paying cash. `` We're trying to be good stewards of this money,'' he said. `` After all, this sort of thing does n't even come once in a lifetime. Your chances of being struck by lightning are four times better.''

<HEAD>Retailers Report January Sales Rise</HEAD>

 Mild weather and lean inventories helped big retailers ring up good sales in January and analysts said the gains reported today may have been larger if the stores had more merchandise to sell. However, analysts noted last month's gains by the nation's largest general retailers occurred during a month that typically is the least important on the industry's calendar Moreover, several store executives and analysts explained that at least part of the sales increase came in comparison with a relatively weak January 1988. `` Generally speaking, the sales have come in very good for the month, better, I think, than anyone would have expected,'' observed <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> also said, `` January is such an insignificant month. January's a cleanup month after Christmas. If you had a couple of good days, that makes a big difference.'' Unseasonably warm weather over much of the country in January probably encouraged shoppers and added to sales volumes. During some years past, severe winter conditions have kept consumers from venturing out to stores. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> said the tight inventories likely depressed January sales. One leading department store chain informed him that it had to scramble to locate merchandise to stock stores during January. `` I believe if there was more inventory, sales would have been better,'' said <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>. Goods were sharply depleted during December, when business was even better than retailers had expected. Also, stores did n't have much left over after Christmas because they already had been holding inventories down to avoid having to slash prices to move unsold merchandise later. Retailers adopted the strategy after two years of sluggish sales in which consumers devoted more of their discretionary income to necessities and services and tried to reduce their high debt levels. Analysts and economists expect this trend to continue this year. Retail sales are closely watched for indications of overall consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the country's overall economic activity The figures today indicated the industry had about 6.5 percent growth in sales last year and analysts predicted a gain of about 5.5 percent to 6 percent for this year. The nation's largest retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its overall sales rose 11.4 percent in the four weeks ended Jan. 28 to $ 2.13 billion from $ 1.91 billion a year earlier. Full-year sales went up 7.3 percent to $ 32.42 billion from $ 30.21 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' same-store sales _ sales in stores open more than a year _ rose 6.2 percent in January and 3.4 percent for the entire year K mart <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales last month and rose 6.9 percent to $ 1.58 billion from $ 1.48 billion. Full-year sales rose 6.5 percent to $ 27.3 billion from 1987's $ 25.63 billion. K mart's same-store sales increased for the month 2.5 percent and 2.8 percent for the year <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 30 percent during January to $ 1.49 billion from $ 1.14 billion. Full-year sales in the year ended Jan. 31 were up 29 percent to $ 20.65 billion from $ 15.96 billion. The discount retailer's same-store sales rose 13 percent for the month and 12 percent for the year. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said sales rose 2.4 percent to $ 738 million in the latest four weeks from $ 721 million The entire year's sales came to $ 13.97 billion, down 0.1 percent from $ 13.98 billion. The results reported were from the biggest general merchandise and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

 A hostile $ 5 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> by South African-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> cleared a major roadblock Thursday when the British government gave it a green light. The <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> decided the offer for the London-based mining and minerals company _ which would be this country's biggest takeover ever _ would n't be against the public interest, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. However, the bid faces other legal or regulatory hurdles in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as well as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, and other countries. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and has ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Oppenheimer family, already holds 29.6 percent of its target's stock. It has 21 days now to renew the bid, which automatically lapsed when it was referred to the commission. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> said it had not yet decided whether to renew its bid, but <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> stock moved up quickly on expectations that <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> would sweeten its offer. On <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>' shares jumped 1.17 pounds -LRB- $ 2.05 -RRB- to 14.20 pounds -LRB- $ 24.80 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s shares rose 14 pence -LRB- 25 cents -RRB- to 731 pence -LRB- $ 12.79 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s September bid was valued at 13.03 pounds -LRB- $ 22.80 -RRB- a share in cash and <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> stock. The Oppenheimer family's gold-mining giant <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its sister diamond group <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> own 60 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s shares. Consolidated Gold Fields' defense has included statements that those connections would harm its businesses, because anti-apartheid supporters might refuse to do business with them. Under white-led <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid, the country's black majority is disenfranchised. The commission said it did not find any likely problem with <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s South African associations. In addition, the Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was investigating a complaint by <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> alleging anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel controlled by <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Beers </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, stressing a message of continuity amid change, assured Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> today that relations are strong and any differences between the two economic powers `` are the differences of friends.'' `` We respect one another. We need one another. We will continue to work together,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he bade farewell to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the first foreign leader to visit the new president in the White House. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> responded to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments with similar warm words, telling him, `` I look to you, Mr. President, for wise and good leadership and you will have my full support. ... Hand in hand, there is nothing we can not achieve.'' Following more than two hours of talks that included a working lunch in the private quarters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the prime minister emerged to read statements in their respective languages at the Diplomatic Entrance. Both men pledged to work to alleviate irritants that have marked the four-decade alliance, particularly in internationl relations, trade and military cooperation. The president said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> can rely on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has borne the major burden of that nation's defense since World War II. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have called upon <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, now a world economic leader, to increase its defense spending. `` We will continue to shoulder the obligations that belong to a global power,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged. `` Continuity will also be the mark of relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. On occasion, we may have differences, but these are the differences of friends,'' the president added. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also applauded <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s efforts to increase its aid to Third World nations. Many in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> hold such spending to be an alternative to military spending, particularly in light of their nation's Constitution, which limits the nation's military to a defensive posture The president also pledged to work toward bringing the two nations' economies `` into better balance,'' and said he was determined to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit. While many in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have criticized <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for failing to open markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods, thereby contributing to the more than $ 50 billion trade imbalance, the Japanese have repeatedly criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit as a cause of the deficit. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> called the military alliance `` firm and sound.'' The prime minister pledged to continue efforts to restructure his economy, a means to open the nation to freer trade. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s specialist on the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said after the session that the meeting `` was not designed to deal with very specific issues'' and that it was geared toward allowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> a chance `` to know each other better. <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> noted that while the two leaders did not discuss a controversial new joint U.S.-Japanese jet fighter project that has come under attack in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> that the project was under review by the administration. Earlier, <PERSON> Koichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Haraguchi </PERSON>, a Japanese spokesman, told reporters he hoped the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminstration would support the project. The agreement under which General Dynamics of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> would joint forces to build so-called FSX jet fighters was negotiated late in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have labeled the project an $ 8 billion giveway of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high technology and have called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to review the agreement. The Japanese government says it needs a final go-ahead from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the project by March 31 to get funds for the project into its current budget. <PERSON> Haraguchi </PERSON> told reporters that to `` go backward'' by scrapping the project would `` be against the interests of both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> later this month for the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who asked not to be identified said today's meeting was timely because talks on such matters as defense, the international economy and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus would be difficult amid ceremonies for the late emperor. `` It's very important for the two leaders to meet early on to establish a personal rapport and a broad-brush agenda,'' the official said. One irritant arose recently when Secretary of Defense-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> suggested during his confirmation hearings that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s contributions to its own defense are inadequate Tower criticized the nation's constitution as a `` lousy idea.'' The 1946 constitution, adopted during the post-World War II <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation, limits <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to a defensive military posture. Tower's comments brought a sharp rebuke from the Japanese, who pointed to a new budget that calls for a 5.9 percent increase in military spending. The senior administration official pointed out that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is spending $ 2.5 billion to support <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed there. He acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would like to see a lot of these things increased,'' but said the administration was pleased <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` is moving in the right direction.''

Full-year results include a non-recurring gain on the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>'s investment in <ORGANIZATION> Cowles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> in February 1988 Newspaper advertising linage increased 1 percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting continuing growth in classified advertising. At <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>, advertising pages edged up 1 percent to 1,132 in the latest compared quarter, but slipped 2 percent for the year to 3,979. Because of rate adjustments and a higher rate base, advertising revenues at <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> gained 18 percent in the quarter and 15 percent for the year, the company said.

 While many prominent <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> business people are short on cash and long on debt, entrepreneur <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> says he's debt-free for the first time in 10 years and may even run for governor. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, founder of <ORGANIZATION> ClayDesta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, recently agreed to merge the long-distance company with 55,000 customers into <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The deal will pay him $ 33 million in cash and $ 10 million in <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> stock. `` I've battled back like a lot of people in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and emerged with a good financial statement,'' he said in an interview in his hometown of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, center of the depressed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> energy industry. `` It's not as good as it once was, but it's better than a lot of people's.'' The move will erase the remainder of what once totaled almost half a billion dollars in debt spread among more than 20 companies owned by <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>, including more than $ 45 million incurred to start <ORGANIZATION> ClayDesta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says that after he closes the merger deal, he will owe `` virtually nothing.'' It's no accident he's paying off debt while the rest of the state suffers effects of the economic catastrophe <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> calls `` The Wreck,'' said the 57-year-old oilman with holdings in real estate, ranching, banking and farming. The dizzying collapse of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> oil and real estate empires in recent years has produced a list of prominent victims that reads like a Who's Who of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tycoons. It includes former Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, industrialist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cowboys </ORGANIZATION> owner Bum Bright. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is unusual because he is n't on the list. Keeping ahead of the economic tide is one of his specialties. Even his bank, <PERSON> ClayDesta </PERSON> <PERSON> National </PERSON>, is making money in a state where troubled banks have become a fact of daily life. Although he denied political aspirations a few months ago, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in January after he returned from a two-week <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> safari that he was considering a run for the governor's office on the Republican ticket. He has said his annual exotic hunting forays often provide him inspiration. It was on another such trip, this one to the Yukon in 1981, that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> decided it was time to get out of the oil and gas business no matter how much it hurt his pride. `` When the time came, I said, ` Clay, you're not such a big deal. You better retrench, consolidate, sell,''' he recalls. His formula for walking away largely unharmed by The Wreck: cut your losses, and if it does n't work, unload it. `` We worked like hell going up and then when The Wreck came, we worked like hell going down to keep from going broke while everything fell apart,'' he said. In more than 30 years of doing business in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> mostly thought only of growth and expansion. Now, he said, `` my direction is tied to bottom line, cash flow, efficiency.'' While paring down helped him survive, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> struggled to nurture his long-distance company, started in the aftermath of the breakup of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> monopoly. `` A lot of things happened to this company that happened to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` We'd sign up people -LRB- as customers -RRB- and a year later, they'd be broke. They would n't even exist anymore. Companies that had 1,000 employees would have 100 or 200.'' Despite hostile economics, <ORGANIZATION> ClayDesta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> grew from five employees to 370 in one year. It's projecting revenues of $ 63 million for 1988 _ up from $ 3 million in revenues in 1984, the year the company was started. Then, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, his oil brought close to $ 30 a barrel and natural gas $ 3 per cubic foot. With today's prices a fraction of that, money to fund a fast-growing company was n't available. `` We were n't able to grow and realize the potential of our market and our employees because I was n't able to put more money and more money into it on $ 12 oil,'' he said. After studying a merger for the communications company for about a year, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> decided Advanced Telecommunications, with more than 150,000 customers and $ 168 million in revenues, would be a good fit. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has never been a fan of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and once grabbed headlines by leading a mounted posse up the steps of the Capitol to protest the proposed deregulation of the telephone giant. Ironically, he found himself in the unfamilar telecommunications business after problems getting phone service for a tenant spawned plans for his own phone company. The digital and fiber optic network he built will continue to form the basis for <ORGANIZATION> ClayDesta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> under the new company. <ORGANIZATION> ClayDesta </ORGANIZATION> will retain its name, management and employees under the merger. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, featured in the company's Western-themed commercials, will sit on <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION>'s board and serve as <PERSON> ClayDesta </PERSON>'s spokesman. With responsibility for the phone company's growth and management now shared, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is looking to bolster other ventures. His cattle operation in Alpine, southwest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is his most profitable business, he said. Given the depressed real estate market and further cutbacks in the energy sector, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he plans to be a bargain hunter. `` The oil business is still sick, which means there could be opportunities, because of The Wreck, for a small efficient operator,'' he said. Ever-cheerful, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is optimistic about discovering hidden profit in unfamiliar businesses. `` It's like being an old hunting dog looking for birds,'' he said. `` If you get out there and get to hunting you'll find some birds, but you've got to get out there first.''

 Grain and soybean futures prices weakened further Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, extending the previous session's losses amid disappointment over slack export sales and weather conditions. New snow in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the Corn Belt will add badly needed moisture to the soil, improving the prospects for a good growing season, analysts said. Meanwhile, rain fell overnight in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the largest soybean-producing countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, giving crops there a boost. Export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, soybean meal and wheat have dwindled since early January, and some traders are losing faith that prices will rally in the near term. `` We've got the market on hold here a little bit and we're seeing a little profit-taking,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

 The stock market showed no clear trend today in a bouncing session as traders awaited Friday's monthly report on employment. Analysts said money managers at investing institutions still seemed to be doing some catch-up buying to try to participate in the market's rally. When prices began rising more than two months ago, many cautious managers were caught by surprise holding large amounts of cash reserves. Brokers noted some uneasiness over Friday's impending report from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the employment situation for January. The data are expected to show a strong increase in payroll employment, which might buttress the case for further credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. However, hopes have spread of late on Wall Street that interest rates are close to peaking out and may decline later in the year.

 Assets of the nation's 454 money market mutual funds rose by $ 18.6 million in the latest week to a record $ 285.37 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a $ 737.2 million increase in the funds' assets the previous week, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.

<HEAD>Chevron Announces `Potentially Significant' Gas Find in Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has announced a `` potentially significant discovery'' of natural gas in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> about 25 to 30 miles south of this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> resort community. If additional drilling confirms a commerical discovery, it would be the first in Gulf waters off the <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. Oil companies have been drilling exploratory wells in the area since the early 1970s but never have found profitable amounts of gas or oil. The <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> well is in a block the company leased jointly with <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who will take over work at the site, including the drilling of a second exploratory well, said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Johathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON>. The new well is to be drilled this summer or early fall. `` We ca n't tell from this first well by itself if we have the kind of reserves we need to support a commercial operation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` But I think it's fair to say this is encouraging. We simply have to see what the potential is.'' <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said it may be five years or more before a decision is made whether to produce gas from the field. If so, it could be an economic boost for the Panhandle in the form of onshore support and supply facilities, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeigler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Most onshore support operations for exploratory drilling in the region have been based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he said. Core samples from <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s exploratory well and seismic tests indicated the presence of gas in a formation called Norphlet sandstone, <PERSON> Lifa </PERSON> said. Large gas fields in lower <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, about 50 miles west of the new find, are in the same kind of formation. The <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> well is in 180 feet of water and was drilled to a depth of 22,572 feet. Last April, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> described the <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> well and an <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> well south of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> as being capable of producing paying quantities. But at that time the companies said they were still studying the drilling results. <ORGANIZATION> Conoco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> were among major buyers when the government offered new leases at nearby sites in the Gulf last November.

 Crude futures prices rallied after sliding most of the day Thursday, fueled by a report that an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> country would cut production if necessary to stabilize prices. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of crude oil, closed 22 cents higher at $ 17.73 a barrel after falling to $ 17.38 earlier in the session. The contract had risen 48 cents on Wednesday to $ 17.51 a barrel. Other contract months were mixed. According to market observers, the report published in an Arabic-language newspaper said <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, the largest producing emirate within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, was willing to cut its output 10 percent after March 1 if market conditions warrant. `` It was psychological,'' said <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, commodity oil broker with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Ten percent only amounts to 40,000 barrels a day. The main thing is <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> had said -LRB- previously -RRB- it would not cut back at all.'' World oil prices had risen rapidly since November, surprising many analysts, but in recent days began easing slightly mainly on technical factors. Investors interpreted Thursday's news as another sign that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> is trying to stabilize prices, analysts said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> is one of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries believed to be exceeding a new production quota established by the 13-member cartel to reduce output and stabilize world oil prices. The quota of 18.5 million barrels a day took effect Jan. 1 but various estimates since then put <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s actual production at between 19.5 million and 20 million barrels. Some reports have suggested the <ORGANIZATION> UAE </ORGANIZATION> is exceeding its quota by some 400,000 barrels a day. Traders said prices also got some support from <LOCATION> Venezuelan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> who during his inauguration on Thursday called for more cooperation by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC countries. Among refined oil products, the March contract for unleaded gasoline lost 0.1 cent to close at 49.62 cents a gallon, while the March contract for heating oil rose 0.11 cent to 50.55 cents a gallon.

Analysts said money managers at investing institutions still seemed to be doing some catch-up buying to try to participate in the market's rally. When prices began rising more than two months ago, many cautious managers were caught by surprise holding large amounts of cash reserves. Brokers noted some uneasiness over Friday's impending report from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the employment situation for January. The data are expected to show a strong increase in payroll employment, which might buttress the case for further credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. However, hopes have spread of late on Wall Street that interest rates are close to peaking and may decline later in the year. Some technology stocks were strong, continuing to benefit from recent earnings reports that exceeded expectations. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 -RCB- to 121 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> 2 -LRB- to 75 -RRB-.

The company said it is looking for earnings growth of 30 percent to 50 percent annually over the next two to three years. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 1.47 billion, or 0.05 percent, in value.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executives testified Thursday that they had not thoroughly examined a pair of half-billion-dollar takeover bids by <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voltage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> before rejecting them two months ago. Universal Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> were the first two witnesses called in a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing over a lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Amanda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary formed by High Voltage Engineering of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> is challenging Universal's poison pill defense and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law, which have blocked its takeover bid that began in December. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> testified that Universal's management and the board of directors did not feel an analysis on the adequacy of <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON>'s two bids submitted in December was necessary before the board voted on the matters. `` Based on the bright future prospects of the company, we determined it was inadequate,'' <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> on Dec. 1 offered $ 30.50 a share for Universal, which valued the company at $ 508 million on the basis of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION>'s 16.7 million shares. It raised its bid two weeks later to $ 35 a share, or $ 585 million. <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> already owns 614,500 shares. Both offers have been rejected by Universal's board, and management has threatened to enforce its poison pill if <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> continues to press its bid. S & amp; W <ORGANIZATION> Berisford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British food conglomerate, is the major backer of <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON>'s bid. According to court documents, it is providing $ 195 million. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and investor bankers <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> would provide the rest of the estimated $ 643 million <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> says it would need to close the deal, including investment banking fees. Under questioning from <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> both confirmed that the company's directors, before they voted on <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON>'s offer, did not seek: _ An analysis of what would be a fair offer for the company _ A determination of what the future value of the company would be _ Opinions from its investment bankers on the adequacy of the Amanda bid _ Any meetings to elicit more information on the history, plans and financing of <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> `` Frankly the company is on a roll and this simply is not the time to be selling the company. You only get to sell the company once,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. In his opening arguments, <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said he hoped to show that Universal's management recklessly pursued a `` just-say-no'' approach to purchase offers and had rejected <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON>'s `` offers even before they had received any information.'' <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> announced Thursday it extended the expiration date of its $ 35 cash tender offer for Universal's common stock through Feb. 13. It also said it had no immediate plans to acquire any shares as a result of the offer, pending a decision in the court suit.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday posted a 23.8 percent fourth-quarter earnings increase, although annual profits declined, and announced an estimated $ 500 million deal with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> to build a four-wheel drive vehicle code-named `` JJ.'' The venture with <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> was the second the nation's No. 3 automaker disclosed with a foreign company during the past week. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week announced it would market autos made in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, beginning in 1991. `` You look at it and it's a ` wow' car,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said of the JJ at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said joint production of the JJ, which was called a `` mini-sport utility vehicle,'' was scheduled to begin in July 1992 at an existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant and one in either <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The Jeep-like vehicle would cost under $ 10,000, he said. The venture will mark <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s return to European production after more than a decade. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will handle North American sales while <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> will be responsible for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the 50-50 venture <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s state-owned automaker aims to sell 100,000 vehicles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 50,000 in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the companies' contribution to the deal would total about $ 500 million. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 28.50, down 37 -LCB- cents, in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 433.6 million, or $ 1.85 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31. That compared with earnings of $ 350.2 million, or $ 1.57 a share, in fourth quarter 1987. Revenue totaled $ 9.69 billion, up 13.6 percent from $ 8.53 billion in the corresponding 1987 quarter. For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 1.05 billion, or $ 4.66 cents a share, down 18.6 percent from $ 1.29 billion, or $ 5.90 a share in 1987. Annual revenue rose to $ 35.5 billion from $ 29.3 billion the previous year. The 1988 results were reduced by $ 93.1 million due to a $ 150 million charge for previously announced plant closings in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said annual results also were affected by the company's strategy to increase market share by reducing some auto prices and offering sales incentives <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck market rose to 14 percent from 12.3 percent in 1987. The share for cars increased to 11.3 percent from 10.8 percent, while the share for trucks was 19.4 percent, up from 18.3 percent in 1987. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also said hourly and salaried workers would receive profit-sharing payments averaging about $ 720 in March. The payments would be the company's first under a profit-sharing agreement signed last year with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> late last year announced profit-sharing of about $ 200 per employee. Officials at No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are expected to announce profit-sharing well over $ 1,000 per worker. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it sold 2.21 million vehicles _ the first time it sold a million cars and a million trucks in the same year _ compared with 1.92 million in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the automaker's financing arm, reported a fourth - quarter profit of $ 74 million, up from $ 60 million a year earlier For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 259 million, up from $ 226 million in 1987. Automakers and analysts have predicted 1988 would be the industry's best earnings year ever, with the Big Three posting combined profits of $ 11 billion. The previous record was the combined $ 9.8 billion profit in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are expected to release their year-end earning figures in mid-February. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also renewed his argument for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should impose a 25 percent tariff on all imported trucks, including minivans and sport-utility vehicles. Some foreign automakers slightly modify vehicles to classify them as cars, such as the popular minivans, and thereby have to pay only a 2.5 percent tariff. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> have called on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to slap the truck tariff on light-utility vehicles. `` If it looks like a truck and walks like a truck and acts like a truck, then it's a truck,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Popeyes Extends Offer For Church's Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Popeyes Fried Chicken and Biscuits owner <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> on Thursday extended his $ 8-a-share offer to <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Fried Chicken shareholders, this time pushing the expiration date to Feb. 19. The move comes two days after <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>'s latest court victory. On Tuesday, the 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused to reconsider an earlier decision allowing <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> to go ahead with the bid. Another court decision over the takeover is pending in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> federal court. The Feb. 19 date is significant because <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s has said it anticipates finishing an auction of the company by then. <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Copeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Popeyes' corporate parent, said Thursday it now has been offered about 7.7 million shares of Church's or about 25 percent of the outstanding shares. That's down from almost 45 percent. Company spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON> said the drop could be attributed to several reasons including the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s to put the company up for auction and the fact that an extension of the deadline was expected. `` We still expect those tenders to come forward,'' he said.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Flatten As Freeze Fears Fade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Orange juice futures prices turned decisively lower Thursday, erasing nearly two-thirds of the past week's gains, as fears of frost damage to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange groves melted away. On other markets, precious metals futures resumed their slide after a 1-day interruption; grains and soybeans moved lower; energy futures and livestock futures were mixed. Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.6 cents to 4.4 cents lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.385 a pound. The March contract had gained 7.4 cents _ boosting the contract's value by $ 1,110 _ during the four previous sessions on concerns that an arctic cold front howling down from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> would spread freezing temperatures all the way to <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> But now that the big chill has reached the nation's heartland, meteorologists are predicting that its impact on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s climate will be less than severe. `` The reality is that the -LRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -RRB- weather is only supposed to drop into the mid-40s and that is absolutely nowhere near freezing,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Another reality is that 45 percent of the 1988-89 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange crop has already been picked, leaving only a portion of the fruit vulnerable even if temperatures did fall below 32 degrees, she said Further selling was linked to the dollar's gains against other currencies, effectively raising prices to European dealers for Brazilian orange juice, which is quoted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. The higher prices could squeeze demand. The dollar's strength also contributed to moderate declines in gold and silver futures prices, which tend to move in tandem with foreign currency values. Some analysts noted a reluctance among traders to buy gold futures ahead of Friday's meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of the finance ministers of the seven major industrialized Western nations. The precious metals staged a modest rally on Wednesday after four days of sharp losses but Thursday's sell-off offset nearly all of gold's gains and about one-third of silver's. Gold settled $ 1.10 to $ 1.40 lower with February at $ 392.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents lower across the board with March at $ 5.863 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures prices continued to slump on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, extending the previous session's losses amid disappointment over slack export sales and precipitation in growing areas. New snow in the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the Corn Belt will add badly-needed moisture to the soil, improving the prospects for a good growing season. Meanwhile, rain fell overnight in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the largest soybean-producing countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, giving crops there a boost. Wheat settled 4 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 4.27 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 3 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.73 a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent lower with March at $ 2.16 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cents to 10 cents lower with March at $ 7.64 Crude-oil futures prices advanced modestly while refined products ended narrowly mixed in choppy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Crude prices surged at midday on reports that <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> had cut its production of crude oil by 10 percent. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 22 cents higher with March at $ 17.73 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent to .25 cent higher with March at 50.55 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was unchanged to .25 cent lower with March at 49.62 cents a gallon. Signs of sluggish demand pressured most cattle and pork futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .28 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 75.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .10 cent lower with March at 84.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent to .70 cent lower with February at 43.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .48 cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at 39.70 cents a pound.

 The dollar finished mixed against major foreign currencies Thursday in listless trading, as the market awaited developments from a meeting of finance ministers from major industrialized countries and the publication of new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> job figures. Gold prices slipped. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 391.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 391.50 late Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency traded in narrow ranges through most of the day, dealers said. It fell in early trading in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, then edged higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on news that the West German central bank did n't alter its monetary policy at its council meeting. But the dollar later fell back after failing to break through key technical points, traders said. Many market participants retreated to the sidelines before the so-called Group of Seven meeting of industrialized nations that began late Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> countries are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Currency traders also are awaiting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment report for January to be released Friday. `` There's a fair amount of uncertainty,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Borish </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Tudor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The best way to trade when you do n't know what's going on is to stay on the sidelines.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell to 129.75 Japanese yen, down 0.65 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 129.48 yen. By the end of trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar had declined to 129.57 yen from 130.33 yen late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar weakened against the British pound. One pound cost $ 1.7515 Thursday, slightly higher for buyers than late Wednesday's $ 1.7500. In late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the pound was quoted at $ 1.7450, down slightly from $ 1.7470 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8775 West German marks, up from 1.8753; 1.5945 Swiss francs, down from 1.5960; 6.3880 French francs, up from 6.3845; 1,371.25 Italian lire, up from 1,370.50; and 1.1893 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1900. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8700 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.5923 Swiss francs, up from 1.5845; 6.3735 French francs, up from 6.3600; 2.1135 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1080; 1,368.50 Italian lire, up from 1,367.50; and 1.1882 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1895 Gold traded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late rate of $ 392.25 a troy ounce, lower than Wednesday's $ 393.

<HEAD>Money Supply Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Jan. 23, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,072.6 billion in the week, from $ 3,070.4 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,914.9 billion from $ 3,914.2 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 785.8 billion from a revised $ 783.6 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last year set a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> is scheduled to announce new targets in late February. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target range for M1 since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,062 billion, a 3.7 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,899.6 billion, up 4.6 percent, while M1 rose 1.4 percent to an average of $ 785.7 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 848 million, compared with a decline of $ 127 million a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 263 million in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 453 million in the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves totaled $ 450 million, up from $ 283 million two weeks earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 289.5 billion in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 290.2 billion one week earlier

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> has filed another suit in its long dispute with American companies over the $ 2.3 billion annual video game market. Nintendo of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Thursday filed legal action in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court against <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, alleging patent infringement. Also named was <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly-owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION> filed a $ 250 million lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, accusing the Japanese video giant of monopolizing the market with restrictions on its licensed game developers. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milpitas </ORGANIZATION>, which is not related to <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, filed a $ 100 million suit against <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>, accusing the company of unfair competition. Early last month, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION>, charging the company with making and selling unauthorized video-game cartridges. In Thursday's action, <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> contended that the manufacture and sale by <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION> of home video cartridges for play on the <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> infringes on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patent issued to <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> in 1989. `` The patent covers a novel system designed to prevent the use of unauthorized computer software on hardware systems,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The action was filed as an amended complaint to the January suit, according to the statement.

<HEAD>Survey: Controllers Disapprove Of Leveraged Buyouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTVALE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporate controllers believe leveraged buyouts have a negative impact on the economy, in a sharp turnaround from a similar survey two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountants </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Of about 1,000 members of the trade group responding to a survey taken in the first week of January, 84 percent said leveraged buyouts do not contribute positively to the economy. That contrasted with February 1987 survey where only 47 percent of the respondents criticized the buyouts. `` The change seems to reflect disapproval of two or three recent large buyouts,'' said <PERSON> Earnest </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huband </PERSON>, president of the Montvale-based accountant's association. In a leveraged buyout, a purchaser uses the assets of a target company to finance debts used to acquire the company. The tactic has become increasingly popular in recent years, as reflected by last year's record $ 24.5 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by the firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Critics contend the huge amounts of debt loaded on to the target companies make them especially vulnerable to failure during an economic downturn. Of those responding to the survey, 60 percent indicated they would like to see greater federal regulation of leveraged buyouts. That compared with 58 percent who were against greater federal regulation of LBOs in a survey conducted last May. Of those supporting greater regulation, 45 percent said the best way would be to eliminate the tax deduction for interest on leveraged buyout financing and 40 percent indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> should to take action. Only 15 percent indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should become involved.

<HEAD>Standards Body Rejects Appeal on New TV Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Deciding a dispute that has split the biggest networks and TV makers, a standard-setting body Thursday rejected an appeal over the standard for producing high-definition television and movies. The standards decision removes lingering doubts about what kinds of cameras, tape recorders and other equipment will be used to produce the coming generation of sharp, bright TV pictures. The market for high-definition television, including production equipment and receivers, is expected to reach tens of billions of dollars a year by early in the coming century. The appeals board of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which has final say, on Thursday voted to turn down an appeal led by <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which said the decision on a standard was made without adequate consensus of interested parties. The board's action means that the new standard is the one proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. The standard prescribes 1,125 horizontal lines per screen, more than twice as many as the 525 lines per screen on today's televisions, permitting far superior pictures However, if the transmission standard is not as sophisticated as the production standard, some of the extra clarity will be lost. A decision on a broadcast standard, which involves the public airwaves, will be made eventually by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The standard matches the Japanese one in having 1,125 lines per screen. But it calls for 60 frames per second, compared to 59.94 frames per second in the Japanese standard. The now-official standard ratifies what exists in most of the high-definition television production equipment that is already in use. But to opponents, it threatens to shut off inventiveness while the industry is still young. `` We're disappointed in the outcome,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mackin </PERSON> said the ABC-led group hoped that the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> would consider accepting additional production standards as they are developed. Adoption of any additional standards would depend on the review of a committee of the engineers' society, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartland </PERSON>, the organization's chief counsel, said in an interview. `` SMPTE does not have a policy against coming up with additional standards,'' he said. Supporting the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> were such companies as <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and a major group of broadcast industry unions, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> On the other side, Capital-Cities <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was supported by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sarnoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Faroudja </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings rose sixfold from a year ago, while another insurance concern, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, posted a 38 percent rise in earnings despite costs associated with its drought coverage. Travelers, based in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, reported earnings of $ 278 million, or $ 2.74 a share, in the fourth quarter compared with $ 43 million, or 37 cents a share, a year ago. The latest results included realized investment gains of $ 41 million and $ 107 million from the sale of businesses in the latest quarter. The 1987 results included realized investment losses of $ 55 million. Income from operations in the quarter rose to $ 237 million from $ 98 million in 1987. For the year, the company's net income slumped to $ 103 million, or 92 cents a share, from $ 374 million, or $ 3.56 a share, a year earlier. The latest results included $ 33 million from sale of assets and realized investment losses of $ 327 million. The 1987 results inlcuded realized investment losses of $ 55 million. Income from operations edged up 0.2 percent to $ 430 million in 1988 from $ 429 million a year earlier. `` The continued strong results in our property-casualty commercial lines operations contributed significantly to total earnings,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. The company's property-casualty commercial lines had operating earnings of $ 337 million in 1988, up from the $ 336 million in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, posted fourth-quarter earnings of $ 83.9 million, or $ 2 a share, compared with $ 51.3 million, or $ 1.23 a share, in the same 1987 period. The latest results reflect a loss of $ 16.5 million that was part of a rain insurance settlement with <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> farmers. <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, said one reason for the jump in earnings was that the company reduced its loss in investments to $ 9.5 million in the latest quarter from $ 36.7 million in 1987. For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> said its profit increased 9.1 percent to $ 359.6 million, or $ 8.55 a share, from $ 330.1 million, or $ 7.95 a share, in 1987. Ms. <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON> said profits were boosted by a 27.8 percent increase to $ 81 million in after-tax investment income. For all of 1988, the company's rain insurance program lost $ 36.3 million after taxes, or 84 cents per share. In December, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a $ 48 million settlement with lawyers representing farmers in 10 states whose rain insurance applications were rejected last summer.

 Two leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday blamed <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators for the failure of private auditors to uncover problems in institutions that later failed.

The accountants on loan provide advice to the bank board before returning to their firms, the legislators said. The statement by the two accompanied a long-awaited report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> that turned up six instances in which independent accounting firms `` did not adequately audit'' institutions that later failed. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' auditing and investigative agency, said it had found `` auditing and reporting problems ... significant enough -LRB- in six cases -RRB- to warrant our referring the CPA firms performing the audits to regulatory and professional bodies for their review.''

The two said they were `` appalled that the ... bank board ... did not step in years earlier to demand reform of auditing procedures and performance.'' They said they would conduct hearings on the matter. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the bank board, said last week that his agency is vigorously pursuing accounting firms that may have contributed to failures. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwider </PERSON> said the agency has civil suits against 11 firms, including three of the so-called `` Big Eight,'' and `` other investigations are underway and could lead to additional suits.'' Of the six institutions cited by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, `` we have or had all under investigation,'' he said. He said the bank board has had a long-standing policy of pursuing accountants, lawyers and other professionals that may have contributed to a failure, but said it takes months and sometimes years to build a successful case. <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> released a statement saying, `` We find it incredible that our name has been mentioned in the context of contributing to S & amp; L industry problems. ...

 The board of <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday rejected a sweetened $ 230 million takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based investment partnership. Fairchild said in a statement its board had rejected <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON>'s $ 16.30-per-share offer as inadequate and not in the best interest of the aerospace company's stockholders The firm also said Thursday it had completed the purchase of $ 75 million in Fairchild stock held by a group led by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Soros </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>, two directors who resigned from the Fairchild board and agreed to refrain from certain, unspecified activities involving the company. Fairchild also said it had completed the sale of 1.6 million shares of common stock to its employee stock ownership plan at $ 16.05 per share. Employee benefit plans now hold 21 percent of the company's outstanding stock, constituting about 19 percent of the voting power. Sales of stock to employee ownership plans is often used as a defensive move against takeover bids. <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> owns nearly 10 percent of Fairchild's stock.

 Rising foreign sales of the anti-baldness drug Rogaine helped boost <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earnings 14 percent in the fourth quarter, the pharmaceutical company said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> reported earnings of $ 80.7 million, or 43 cents a share, for the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $ 70 million, or 38 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1987.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way Thursday for criminal prosecution of five factory officials whose employees contend they were injured by a `` toxic cocktail'' and other unsafe working conditions. Without dissent, the state's highest court ruled that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act does not bar criminal prosecution for unsafe working conditions. A <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury indicted the five officials of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 on charges of aggravated battery, reckless conduct and conspiracy. However, a circuit judge dismissed the indictments a year later, ruling they were pre-empted by federal law. The indictment charged that 42 workers suffered nerve and lung disorders, scars from metals and other problems as a result of their working conditions. Prosecutors said the factory lacked safety equipment, proper cooling and ventilation and that workers were exposed to what a doctor who examined them called a `` toxic cocktail'' of hazardous chemicals. They said accounts of conditions at the suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> factory, where wire was coated with polyvinyl chloride and other chemicals, `` resemble a historical narrative about conditions in the ` sweat shops' of the mid-19th century.'' The case drew the attention of business groups from across the nation, as well as county prosecutors from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who sought to try similar cases in their areas. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling, which sets a precedent, is of national importance,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, whose office investigated the case. `` It will help safegaurd the workers of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> from deliberate harm at the hands of a very few unscrupulous employers who put profits above the safety of their workers.'' Business leaders warned that Thursday's decision could lead to a patchwork of safety standards varying among counties and states, with executives facing criminal sanctions if their factories failed to pass muster. `` What can an employer do to forsee all of these circumstances, with the possibility that he may be hauled before the grand jury and indicted?'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottschalk </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said only `` a very few unscrupulous employers'' would have anything to worry about. `` The evidence we uncovered showed that the defendants knew of the dangers, did nothing to protect their employees, and in fact, concealed the danger to the workforce,'' he said at a news conference. `` This alleged conduct went beyond the issues regulated by <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> and can only be addressed properly in the criminal courts,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. Thursday's ruling also set a possible precedent for another <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> case in which three executives of <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> company, were convicted of murder and sentenced to prison in the death of a factory worker who was exposed to cyanide on the job. That case, currently on appeal, was the first in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history in which corporate executives were convicted of murder in a safety-related workplace death. In their opinion Thursday, the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> justices noted that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided a similar pre-emption question in upholding a punitive damage award to the estate of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Silkwood </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kerr-McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> worker whose death brought national attention to safety concerns in the nuclear industry. `` It is totally unreasonable to conclude that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended that <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s penalties would be the only sanctions available for wrongful conduct which threatens or results in serious physical injury or death to workers,'' Justice <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> wrote for the court. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Silets </PERSON>, a attorney for one of the defendants, has predicted that the case ultimately will go to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He and other defense lawyers did not return telephone calls seeking comment on Thursday's decision.

 A federal judge began hearing testimony Thursday on a request by <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to block a stockholders meeting Centaur Partners has demanded in its $ 765 million hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>. Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, hopes to use the meeting to replace the chemical company's board with directors sympathetic to its offer. In issuing the demand Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> delivered proxies that it said represented owners of approximately 34.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares State law requires a company to hold any meeting requested by stockholders with at least 20 percent of the firm's shares. Centaur, whose principals are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financiers <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON>, launched the $ 100-a-share bid in mid-December. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed unchanged Thursday at $ 105.62 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> claims Centaur included inadequate disclosure in the tender offer, would be short at least $ 57 million to finance the merger and failed to reveal that <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> filed for personal bankruptcy six years ago and was accused of fraud in 1979. Attorney <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, alleged in a legal brief that <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> would suffer irreparable harm without a temporary injunction to stop the meeting. `` The court should recognize that the public interest is not served by permitting a takeover developed through misleading public statements to come to fruition,'' the brief said. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON>, the lawyer for Centaur, and attorney <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Savett </PERSON>, speaking for a group of stockholders, disagreed and insisted the only issue was whether a stockholders meeting should be held. `` We are not concerned with whether this is a good offer, a fair offer or a bad offer, but whether there has been full disclosure,'' <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gawthrop </PERSON>. `` It is up to the shareholders to decide about the offer.'' <PERSON> Savett </PERSON> also said the stockholders should be allowed to meet quickly and make the decision. In his brief, <PERSON> Kauffman </PERSON> said, `` Centaur has disclosed all material information with respect to the financing of the offer as required under the federal securities laws.'' <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> called <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> as a hostile witness and brought out that he had filed for personal bankruptcy in 1983, reporting debts of more than $ 1 million and assets of about $ 3,500. A court document also disclosed that in 1979 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and others were accused of fraudulent stock transfers totaling nearly $ 400,000. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said there was never any adjudication of the charges. In a related development, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> dropped a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has agreed to provide $ 400 million in short-term financing for the takeover. The lawsuit contended the tender offer violated federal securities laws by containing misleading statements.

 A freighter arrived at the port of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION> on Friday with coal from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the first direct merchandise shipment from north to south since the Korean War. The shipment comes just one day after <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s giant <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate said it signed an agreement to build a tourist resort, shipyard and railroad plant in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The South Korean government said Friday that it `` in principle takes a favorable view of the proposed projects, regarding them as possible pilot projects that could contribute to efforts to achieve national unification.'' The Conch, a Panamanian-registered freighter, took 20,900 tons of anthracite coal to the western port of <LOCATION> Inchon </LOCATION>. Previous imports from the north have come came through third countries. The North Korean coal was imported by <ORGANIZATION> Hyosung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a South Korean trading firm, at $ 52.50 per ton or a total of $ 1.09 million. On Thursday, South Korean tycoon <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju-yung </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'s honorary chairman, confirmed after returning from a 10-day trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that he had agreed in principle with the north to undertake the resort and other projects along its east coast He was the first <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> business leader known to have visited the north with the approval of both governments since <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was split in 1945. The Koreas fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 and have never signed a peace treaty. Under the agreement signed in the north's capital, <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and a North Korean state-run corporation will jointly develop a resort around scenic <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kumgang </LOCATION> to attract <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> and foreigners, <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kumgang </LOCATION> area is about 20 miles from the demilitarized zone that divides the Koreas. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> told a airport news conference that the two sides also agreed to jointly develop resources in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and to jointly operate a railroad rolling stock plant and a shipyard, both at <LOCATION> Wonsan </LOCATION> in the north. He had already discussed the Siberian projects with Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The agreement was signed by <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Taesong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of the Promotion of Asian Trade. Because both are state agencies, the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government's approval of the projects was seen as guaranteed. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said the projects are subject to approval form both governments, but one <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> official said the south would approve the undertakings as a pilot project to stimulate inter-Korean cooperation. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has been seeking direct trade and other exchanges to ease tension between the two Koreas with an eventual goal of reunification. Both Koreas recently have made contacts to arrange high-level government and parliamentary talks to pave the way for peace.
