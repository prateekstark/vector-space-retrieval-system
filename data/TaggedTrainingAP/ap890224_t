<TEXT>
 A bookstore chain caught up in the controversy of `` The Satanic Verses'' went on the offensive Thursday, with writers and booksellers decrying death threats against its author and <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> groups seeking compassion for their faith. `` Let's not be stampeded by this kind of intellectual terrorism. Let's vote with our wallets. Buy the book,'' said poet and novelist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Anania </PERSON> at a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>'s Cultural Center. Writers nationwide have rallied in support of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose novel has enraged Moslems and brought a death sentence from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and offers of a $ 5.2 million bounty. Moslem leaders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, while denouncing the death sentence and threats of violence against bookstores, said the book was intolerable to followers of Islam and called for withdrawal of `` this slanderous work.'' `` We simply expect the media to accord Muslims the same rights that have been generally extended to other religious minorities,'' said <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammad </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` It is regrettable that <ORGANIZATION> Viking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- publishers, has shown insensitivity to the concerns of Muslims.'' Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bookstore chains had yanked the book off shelves, but <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Barnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Noble bookstores, which are under common ownership, decided Wednesday to stock the book. The third chain, Waldenbooks, the nation's largest with 1,200 stores, placed full-page advertisements in Friday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and eight other newspapers, saying it will continue to sell the book despite `` many threats of violence.'' In the text of the ad, Waldenbooks complained that it was subjected to `` unfair castigation'' for telling its outlets to remove the book from their shelves for security reasons. Waldenbooks noted that it continued to sell the book while not displaying it until its supply ran out. Also, late last week it gave store managers permission to display the book at their discretion. `` We will continue to sell the book when it comes back in stock at the publisher,'' Waldenbooks said. `` We will continue to use discretion in displaying the book.'' The chain's president, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, has said it has received about 60 bomb threats. The Times reported in Friday's editions that demand for `` The Satanic Verses'' has been strong among independent booksellers, who report taking orders for nearly 200,000 copies of the book. Yet all of the more than 300 independent booksellers surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said they did not have copies of the book for sale. Protests also came from groups in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The ayatollah has n't only taken out a contract on <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>: he has taken out a contract on our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> freedoms to read, to write, and to express ourselves as we choose,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the American Way. The 275,000-member organization has opposed efforts by American fundamentalists to censor textbook and school reading lists. An ad hoc group calling itself the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for Free Expression also issued a statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> decrying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s threats against the British author. `` We can not and will not tolerate a threat to assassinate a writer for his ideas or others for disseminating those ideas,'' declared the committee, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. At the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> rally, 300 writers and supporters heard Pulitzer Prize-winning author <PERSON> Studs </PERSON> <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> compare <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scopes </PERSON>, who was tried for teaching Darwinism, and author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, criticized for his `` Grapes of Wrath.'' <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a British citizen born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> into a Moslem family, went into hiding in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> because of the death threats. The president of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiseruddin </PERSON>, said after the writers' speeches that he objects to the death sentence, but does n't believe such `` very strong, profane passages about people Moslems respect the most'' should be tolerated by society. A writer in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was organizing a public reading of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s work for March 9, the day he was supposed to give a reading during a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> promotional tour that was canceled At a public reading Wednesday night at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, those who read the passages said their intent was not to offend Islam but to protest censorship. `` We are here to confirm our right as Americans to read whatever we want,'' said graduate student <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, but in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> his given name was seldom used. In Japanese he was simply called <PERSON> Tenno </PERSON> <PERSON> Heika </PERSON>, meaning His Majesty The Emperor. The foreign habit of using his name rankled some Japanese, who found it impolite, and unnecessary since to them there is only one emperor. Some Japanese complained that after his death it even became inaccurate to call him <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> because he has been given the posthumous name <PERSON> Showa </PERSON>. In Japanese histories, he will be recorded as Emperor <PERSON> Showa </PERSON>, the name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926. It means Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded by <LOCATION> Heisei </LOCATION>, or Achieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> a few hours after the emperor died Jan. 7. But for the convenience of the rest of the world, which is not so able to keep track of the person behind the changed name, even official agencies have used the name <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in English-language publications. The obituary issued in English by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which is supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, was headed `` His late Majesty The Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>.'' English-language newspapers published in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> quickly began using the name <PERSON> Showa </PERSON> for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> after his death, but it did not become truly official until Jan. 31, when Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> conducted a ceremony in which <PERSON> Showa </PERSON> became the late emperor's posthumous name. A stone tablet placed in his tomb is engraved only with the posthumous name and the dates of his death and burial. The custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their reigns began after the death in 1912 of Emperor <PERSON> Meiji </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s grandfather In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, years are numbered according to the emperor's tenure on the throne. Thus 1926 became Showa 1 as Crown Prince <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> ascended to the throne on Dec. 25 when his father, Emperor <PERSON> Taisho </PERSON>, died. The year 1927 was Showa 2, and 1989 was <ORGANIZATION> Showa </ORGANIZATION> 64 until <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death on Jan. 7. Now this year is <ORGANIZATION> Heisei </ORGANIZATION> 1. The Japanese custom of changing imperial names is not unique among world royalty, where an individual may have a variety of names and titles in a royal career. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> became the Duke of York upon his marriage in 1986.

 An <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> businessman who lost $ 125,000 in uncut diamonds during his return from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> got them back from a good Samaritan who found them on an airport sidewalk. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacioppo </PERSON>, a 53-year-old office worker, received a $ 7,500 reward from <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <PERSON> Rigby </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, for his good deed. <PERSON> Cacioppo </PERSON> returned the diamonds Thursday to a Walker business associate, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, during a meeting at the office of <PERSON> Cacioppo </PERSON>'s lawyer. `` Mr. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was certainly pleased,'' <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> said. `` We were a little surprised that they had n't been turned in earlier.'' He said they were virtually worthless uncut. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 62, lost the diamonds at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Friday, when he flew in from <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. He had returned from his travels with 76 uncut stones, worth about $ 220,000, which he had mined and purchased in <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>. He carried them in two envelopes pinned inside his pants pockets. But when <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> reached the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> desk at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, one envelope was missing. He reported the loss Saturday. <PERSON> Cacioppo </PERSON>, of suburban Mount Prospect, was on the same <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight and said he found the envelope of diamonds on the sidewalk outside a terminal. `` I picked it up and put it in a pocket without looking in it because I was n't feeling too swift,'' he said. Because of his illness, <PERSON> Cacioppo </PERSON> said he stayed in bed Saturday and finally got up on Sunday to eat something. Then his wife asked about the package. `` I opened it and was n't sure what they were,'' he said. `` I took them to a friend, who told me he thought they were real diamonds.'' <PERSON> Cacioppo </PERSON> said he was excited and pretty nervous about the discovery, and at the insistence of a friend, contacted attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> for advice. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> phoned <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police, who provided <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s telephone number. <PERSON> Cacioppo </PERSON>, who plans to use the money to finance his son's college education, said he did not regret giving up the diamonds. `` It was the right thing to do.''

<TEXT>
 The heads of <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> have joined forces to condemn an annual snowball fight that nearly blinded a student in one eye this winter. The two school leaders released a statement Thursday blasting the Dec. 14 fight as <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> prepared a lawsuit against its neighbor, <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION>, for building damages and medical costs incurred by the injured student, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonya </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` The freshman student had to undergo emergency surgery to save an eye. In light of this incident it has become clear to us that we can no longer tolerate the continuation of this ` tradition,''' <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pouncey </PERSON> and UMass Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said in the statement. <PERSON> Pouncey </PERSON> estimated damage to the school at more than $ 10,000 in the last several years. The two school leaders promised `` to educate our students about the dangers of this event and ... plan other measures to deter students from participating.'' <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said it was unclear what further measures the schools will take. She said police have been unable to identify <PERSON> Gonya </PERSON>'s assailants from videotapes of the snowball fight. The fights usually take place on the first significant snowfall of the year. University students march to the <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> campus a mile away and engage in battle. <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> will seek a preliminary injunction to allow campus and town police to arrest anyone found instigating a snowball fight at the school, said school spokesman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The complaint against <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> is expected to be filed with <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the next few days, according to <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pouncey </PERSON> contended that the violence has escalated as students have begun packing snowballs with rocks that have broken several dormitory windows. <PERSON> Gonya </PERSON>, who may have been hit with a snow-covered rock, spent five days in hospitals in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Doctors say his vision is blurry, but he will regain sight in a few months. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> UMass </ORGANIZATION> paid more than $ 3,000 to <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for damages from that year's snowball fight. The college claims UMass still owes $ 1,788 from last year's bombardment. `` I do n't think this university as an institution is liable for the behavior of its students once they leave the campus,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> has said.

<TEXT>
 Newspaper headlines show a vastly different <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from the nation that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fought five decades ago in World War II. _ `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Launches Scientific Satellite.'' A routine matter; EXOS-D is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 12th spacecraft to go into orbit to study the Earth. _ `` Japanese Airline Announces Multibillion-Dollar Airliner Purchase.'' Also routine; <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest customer is <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, and Wednesday's order by its competitor, <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, could make ANA the biggest buyer of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s new 747-400s and hack $ 7 billion off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. _ `` Funeral Diplomacy in Full Swing as World Leaders Arrive.'' Not routine; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> buries Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> on Friday, the first imperial funeral in 62 years. Despite memories of aggression committed in <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s name in World War II, his funeral has brought dignitaries from more than 160 countries to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> political science professor <PERSON> Seizaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said there were two reasons for so many countries to come: `` One is the increasing interdependence of the countries throughout the world. And the second is the increasing importance of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the world community.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is rich. It is exerting international influence through financial power while its military strength is held in check by a postwar constitution that rejects force as a way of dealing with international disputes. In many ways, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is about as up to date as you can get. Its industrial prowess has made its automakers into global operators who produce more motor vehicles than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitors. In high technology, the Japanese are at the forefront of superconductivity research and computer developments. The robust economy is propelled by the renowned diligence and managerial skill of the Japanese. At the government's urging, the economy is being restructured to depend more on domestic consumption than on the export drives that led to trade imbalances and friction with other countries. One problem is politics, which is widely held to have been corrupted by the tide of cash that has accompanied <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rise to economic superpower. A headline in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>: `` Questioning of Political Figures Looms.'' The story said that prosecutors investigating suspected bribery are on the verge of deciding whether to question 17 politicians about ethically dubious share transactions that benefitted them or their aides. Among those politicians is Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the chairman of the committee organizing <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral and playing host to the presidents, kings, prime ministers and other foreign officials now in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Also on the list are <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, and other leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> All have denied any wrongdoing. But some Japanese media are speculating that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will not last long, despite his announced intention to clean up political ethics starting right away. Still looming are those prosecutors, who arrested eight businessmen and bureaucrats in the last two weeks for questioning on suspicion of bribery or securities law violations but have n't touched the politicians yet The conservative party has governed since World War II with the exception of 10 months of socialist Cabinets in 1947-48. It holds fat majorities in both houses of the Diet, or Parliament _ 297 of 512 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and 143 of 252 in the upper House of Councillors. In July, however, elections will be held for half the upper-house seats, and the ruling party is worried. A setback would probably send <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to the back benches of the Diet, and the Recruit scandal has tainted so many leaders of his party that it's hard to guess who would succeed him. Another of Thursday's headlines: `` <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>'s Man Quits Race for Governor Over Recruit Funds.'' <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is the conglomerate at the center of the stock-trading scandal threatening the ruling party, and it has become anathema to have received its donations. The news story says that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> persuaded his candidate, <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aichi </PERSON>, to withdraw from the <PERSON> Miyagi </PERSON> prefecture gubernatorial race because <LOCATION> Aichi </LOCATION> had received $ 60,000 in donations from Recruit since 1975. The conservatives' long grasp on power has both stultified politics and encouraged corruption, analysts say. It's also widely held that the conservatives' pro-business policies helped make <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> the peaceful economic giant it has become after being laid waste in the war. This conundrum of money politics linked with economic strength is making the Japanese especially thoughtful as they close a long chapter of history in burying their emperor of 62 years. A headline from Thursday evening's television news: `` Prosecutors Question Former NTT Head.'' <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is the most valuable company in the world in terms of stock market capitalization. Its former chairman, <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, had a reputation as an exponent of clean business and politics until he resigned last year in disgrace after it was shown he had profited in the Recruit scandal's shady stock transactions.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Castration Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee has approved a bill that would permit a jail sentence to be suspended for a convicted rapist, criminal deviate or child molester who undergoes surgical castration. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>, an investigator for the public defender in <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and a former constable, said he introduced the bill out of frustration that current criminal sanctions against rapists and child molesters do n't deter criminals from committing those acts again. `` You take the part away from the man that starts the process in the first place,'' said <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>, a Republican. The crimes now carry prison sentences of six to 50 years, depending on the circumstances. The bill, which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved by a 5-3 vote on Thursday, calls for a convicted rapist, child molester or criminal deviate to be set free if after sentencing the person volunteers for surgical castration. The measure now goes to the full House. An opponent of the bill, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, pointed out that many child molestation cases do n't involve intercourse. Offenders castrated after those crimes might still commit child molestation again, he said. `` I do n't think we ought to be setting our policy in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to follow Islamic countries,'' said <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. Another opponent, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, argued that rape often is a crime of violence, not one motivated by sexual drives. Under <PERSON> Worden </PERSON>'s proposal, she said, a convicted rapist who had been castrated could go free to commit other violent acts.

<HEAD>Government Report Cites `Elevated Risk' Of Cancer In Tannery Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal health officials have reported for the first time that some leather tannery workers exposed on the job to a controversial solvent are at increased risk for testicular cancer. An estimated 90,000 or more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers are exposed to the chemical solvent dimethlyformamide, or DMF. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that while tannery workers exposed to the solvent are at `` elevated risk,'' DMF can not currently be shown as a `` definitive'' cause, and the exact risks require further evaluation. DMF is also used in the aircraft industry. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> believes that about 94,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers are potentially exposed to the solvent. Three cases of testicular cancer were diagnosed in workers at a leather tannery in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> between 1982 and 1984, triggering a state and federal investigation. The tannery had used DMF to help dyes seep into the leather being processed there. Three such cases among 80 workers on the plant's finishing line between 1975-87 is 41 times greater than would be expected statistically, which `` indicates an elevated risk for testicular cancer among finishing line workers,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Further, a survey of medical records found seven additional cases of testicular cancer in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> males aged 20-54 between 1974 and 1987. `` Five of the 10 case-patients ... had been employed in leather-related occupations,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its report Thursday, prepared with <ORGANIZATION> NIOSH </ORGANIZATION>. Two of those five patients were from tanneries other than the original investigation site, <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report noted that the tannery, identified in news reports as the Pan American tannery of <LOCATION> Gloversville </LOCATION>, had withdrawn its DMF dyes and replaced them with other materials, and other nearby facilities have done the same or are considering it.

 Democrats and Republicans alike say they are concerned that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> forced <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-designate <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to forgo nearly $ 300,000 he was entitled to from his medical school job. `` I feel what is being asked of you has not been asked of others in the past,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which endorsed <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> on a 19-0 vote Thursday. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., agreed, saying, `` It is grossly unfair to him ... My hope is we can reopen this issue with the White House.'' The issue of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s severance pay from the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> came to light earlier this month when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was trying to fend off ethical questions about several of his other top appointees. Committee members said they think the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overreacted and forced <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> to give up the severance pay even though he was entitled to the money and accepting it would not have violated any ethical rules. At the time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on the defensive on ethics issues, with questions being raised about Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s relationships with defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics chief <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s links to a communications corporation, Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s acceptance of speaking fees exceeding <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits, and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s acceptance of a lavish reception from a tobacco company. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that he decided to forgo the severance pay because conflict-of-interest questions were raised in news reports about the arrangement. He said such questions could hamper his effectiveness and damage the image of <LOCATION> Morehouse </LOCATION>. `` I felt it was more important to clear up those questions by the action I took,'' he said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the Office of Government Ethics, has said the office concluded that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was entitled to take the severance pay, but that he surrendered it before the opinion could be written. The White House did not return calls for comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns Thursday <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said after the hearing that it appeared the nominee's decision to forfeit the money `` has been pressed on him,'' adding that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> `` is not in any kind of position to make that kind of sacrifice. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> might look into the matter and, if appropriate, clarify that ethics rules were not intended to apply to the kind of contractual arrangement <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> had with <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>. The severance pay generated more interest among committee members than <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s position on abortion, which had produced the most public controversy over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s only black Cabinet nominee. In his opening statement to the committee, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he holds the same views on the issue as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` I am opposed to abortion, except when the life of the mother is threatened, or cases of rape or incest.'' He also said he supports an anti-abortion amendment to the Constitution with the same exceptions and would like to see the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturn its 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling that legalized abortion. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> apologized to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., for having `` misspoken'' his position on abortion in a private meeting with the senator when he reportedly said he favored retaining <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> He did not address remarks he made in an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspaper that he supported abortion rights. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, acting president of <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said following the committee vote that he was `` deeply troubled'' by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s testimony. `` It is obvious that much political maneuvering has gone on in the weeks since Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s appointment was first announced,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. The National Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which was riled by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s earlier remarks, welcomed the secretary-designate's statements opposing abortion However, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative director of the anti-abortion group, said he was disappointed that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> refused to say whether he would extend a moratorium barring federal funding of medical research involving the transplant of fetal tissue. Questioned by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said: `` I certainly would not want to do anything that would encourage abortion to be done in order to get fetal tissue. However, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said he would not venture further on the issue until he reviews the recommendations of an advisory committee and consults with others about when, if ever, it might be appropriate to use fetal tissue for medical research. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said he was disappointed in <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s reply and, when the time came to vote on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation, the senator simply voted `` present.''

<HEAD>Democrats Outspend GOP for Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrats who control <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> now dominate the means of getting there, having spent more money, raised more and received more from special interests than the Republicans. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> put the price tag for electing the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year at $ 458 million, not appreciably higher than it was to finance the campaigns of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> two years earlier. However, the commission, in a report issued Thursday, found that the Democrats now have surpassed the Republicans in raising money for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns from political action committees. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the Democrats have widened the lead they held previously. One result is that Republicans suddenly are sounding like threadbare populists, while Democrats say they have made peace with the captains of industry who once regarded them with suspicion. `` All of the Democrats' expressions of concerns about the Republicans being the party of moneyed interests are shown up by these figures to be absolutely false,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which provides money and other help for GOP House candidates. However, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said her party was able to recruit stronger candidates and they, in turn, were able to attract greater contributions. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Democratic candidates got almost $ 24.9 million from political action committees, or PACs, while Republicans received $ 21.5 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> report. Until last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans had raised more money from PACs than did Democrats. In 1986 the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> raised $ 4.9 million more than Democrats from PACs, and in 1984 the margin was $ 1.6 million. The differences were far more pronounced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where the Democrats' control is more lopsided. House Democratic candidates received more than $ 66.9 million from PACs while Republicans got barely half that amount, $ 34.9 million. The gap between Democrats and Republicans in 1986 was $ 22 million and in 1984 it was $ 17 million. `` I think that PACs take a look at races and they take a look at candidates and I think, frankly, we just had better candidates,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` They are not perceived as hostile to the business community, as they are n't. `` I think this is a party that realizes that certainly business is important to this country.'' Overall, the Democrats raised $ 107.4 million for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns and spent almost $ 107.5 million in 1987 and 1988, the two-year period the election commission uses for compiling figures on the most recent election. The Republicans raised $ 91.3 million and spent $ 93.2 million. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> raised $ 159.8 million and spent $ 145.1 million while the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> received $ 116.6 million and spent $ 110.5 million. Another $ 1.3 million was spent by the 264 candidates who ran for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as independents or on minor-party tickets. Republicans in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have called for reform of the campaign finance system, saying it gives an unfair advantage to incumbents _ most of whom are Democrats. But while backing some means of limiting spending, the Republicans are against any reform that would involve public financing of congressional campaigns, as is now the case with presidential candidates. Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said Republicans have become recent converts to the idea of finance reform. `` The Republicans did n't complain about the PAC system in 1986, when they controlled the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and their incumbents outspent our challengers 2-1 or 2 -LCB- -1,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. Among Senate candidates, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., spent far more than anyone else to keep his job _ nearly $ 13 million <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s Democratic opponent, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, spent almost $ 7 million That was considerably less than in the 1986 campaign, when <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s colleague from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, spent nearly $ 10.8 million to fend off Republican <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zschau </PERSON>, who spent some $ 11.3 million. `` It's just because it's so damned expensive to run in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Royster </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` The media market in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is so massive and so expensive it virtually compels a candidate for statewide office there to raise more money than some would think is humanly possible.'' Ms. <PERSON> Royster </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> accepts fund-raising as something he has to do to be in politics, but it `` drives him crazy.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> raised $ 1.8 million from PACs, second only to Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who raised more than $ 2.3 million. `` He says while he does not believe there is a conflict of interest involved in accepting <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> contributions, as long as there is a public perception that it is creating a conflict of interest, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a responsibility to do something about reform,'' Ms. <PERSON> Royster </PERSON> said. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, two Democrats who unsuccessfully sought an open seat in a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> special election topped the spending list. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskind </PERSON> spent nearly $ 2.6 million while <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredesen </PERSON> spent almost $ 1.9 million. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Clement </PERSON>, who beat them, spent just $ 938,492, but that brings the total spent on that one seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to nearly $ 5.4 million. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> won a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a distinction in the 1988 campaign. He spent nearly $ 7.4 million on his campaign and some $ 6.1 million of that was his own money, a record for the year. Much of the remainder was borrowed.

<TEXT>
 More than a month after taking office, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is still marking time on major foreign policy issues while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> takes the initiative in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and nuclear weapons reduction talks remain on hold. The funeral diplomacy President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is conducting in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> _ 20-minute meetings with world leaders assembled for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s rites _ is being described in some press accounts as `` mini-summitry,'' but the sessions are so brief they can only scratch the surface of difficult problems. In the meantime, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is winding up a whirlwind swing through the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in which he offered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a resumption of diplomatic ties in exchange for attending a peace conference with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Apart from that proposal, the <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> trip is important because it marks a new initiative by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to work with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> moderates instead of the radical forces that are only on the periphery of events. That could make the Soviets an important player _ especially if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> restores ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after a lapse of more than 21 years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remark this week before his departure for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> that the Soviets would _ and should _ play only a limited role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomacy drew a light-hearted rebuke Thursday in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` That is sad,'' the foreign minister said. `` It injects a meaning of rivalry. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can single-handedly resolve all the issues in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> we would welcome that. But they ca n't. There must be a collective effort to defuse the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> crisis.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not be rushed or stampeded by Soviet moves, but the pressure for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative is coming not only from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Touring <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> capitals last week, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was urged by the British, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION>, Dutch, Greek and French to seize on what they contend is growing Palestinian moderation and to get involved in peace-making. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told them it would be a mistake to move too quickly or to aim too high if the situation did not call for it. And he was still cautious after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said there were `` perhaps some opportunities out there with respect to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process that have n't existed before.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, there was no word on when the policy review would be completed. Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` policies are being looked at in a broad sense.'' He said experts were examining the issues and that policy-makers would get involved `` at the appropriate time.'' The review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control policy also is in low gear. Negotiations with the Soviets to reduce long-range nuclear weapons were to resume last week. The talks have been postponed indefinitely, although <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact will open separate negotiations on non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on March 7. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was aiming at a 50 percent reduction in strategic nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines. The two main obstacles to completing a treaty were the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative and finding ways to verify compliance with the accord. Policy-makers in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may be less committed to the search for a space-based defense against ballistic missiles. That could point to a compromise with the Soviets, who are determined to slow down the `` Star Wars'' program. On the other hand, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the assistant to the President for national security affairs, might push for development of a new mobile missile. That could complicate the verification problem, as well as require a re-calculation of some tentative weapons ceilings set during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. And completing the START treaty could be delayed even further.

<HEAD>Services Stretching to Meet Recruiting Goals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A long-predicted downturn in military recruiting has begun, with <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recruiters missing their quotas for the first time this decade, the Pentagon says. The other three military services managed to hit their enlistment quotas for the first quarter of fiscal 1989, but also are showing signs of distress, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The downturn has been predicted for more than a year, primarily because of the strong economy and a dwindling pool of 18-year-olds. `` But we need to act now to head off future recruiting problems,'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for force management and personnel. `` The first step is to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on military pay and to restore the value of recruiting incentives, advertising resources and education benefits,'' he said. `` Otherwise, we could begin the chain of events that led to the serious military manpower problems of the last decade.'' The latest manpower report covers the period from last Oct. 1 to Dec. 31. During those three months, the four services had a combined quota of 61,900 people. The services signed up 61,700 _ or just 200 shy of their goal. But breaking the statistics down by individual service, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fell short of its goal of 24,143 by 475 men and women _ the first such decline since 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> managed to exceed its quarterly goal of 18,900 by signing up 19,200 men and women. But it did so by calling up, earlier than expected, volunteers who had joined the Delayed Entry Program to put off their military service by a few months. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> also had to increase the percentage of `` Category 4'' volunteers _ or low scorers on the military entrance test _ that they accepted, the report shows. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had to accept almost 11 percent of its recruits from Category 4, more than double the 4 percent level maintained for the past three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> matched its recruiting goal during the quarter by bringing in 7,100 men and women, and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> also matched its objective of 11,800. `` But the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> have reported they are working harder to meet their recruiting objectives,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` While the department still considers this recruiting performance to be good, environmental factors can not be ignored,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Unemployment is at a 14-year low; the youth population will continue to decline through fiscal 1996, and budgetary pressures remain a concern.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> projections, the pool of 18-year-olds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been declining for some years and wo n't begin increasing again until at least 1996

<TEXT>
 While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is half a world away, his supporters are trying to convince skeptical conservatives he is a worthy successor to their longtime hero <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> started the revolution,'' former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told Thursday's opening session of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'll bet you right here and now today that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, will consolidate it, strengthen it, broaden it, broaden its appeal.'' Long a conservative favorite, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> now is housing secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hand-picked chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, cited his involvement in three <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidential campaigns and then said, `` Another hero of mine is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Confronted by an openly critical delegate from <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said that `` there is something to criticize about any president'' but conservatives were `` not going to get a better conservative elected the rest of this century than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' YAF delegates from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> issued a `` report card'' on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency and said he `` has walked away from his conservative campaign promises that won him the election.'' The group gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an `` F'' on aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. `` It is well known that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will refuse to seek military aid to the freedom fighters,'' they said. When <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the chairman of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> YAF chapter, confronted the party chairman after the speech, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said, `` There's nobody who feels stronger about freedom fighters across this globe than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` I would not judge things quite this early if I were you and I would n't be too harsh on him until you see what happens,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` I have to judge him, sorry,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` I'm sorry, too,'' said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is used to criticism from delegates to this annual meeting. Two years ago, as the fight for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination was heating up, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outraged many conservatives by declining an invitation to address C-PAC. His six rivals appeared at the conference. Despite opposition from many conservative activists, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> easily won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination and a little more than a month ago succeeded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the White House. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was a regular participant at C-PAC meetings, and his retirement cast a long shadow on the current one. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, one of the principal sponsors of the conference, noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had participated in 13 of the 16 C-PAC meetings, including all those held while he was president. `` His absence this year really is symbolic of another change within the movement, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era, for all of its importance ... has ended,'' said <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Picchio </PERSON>, national chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION>, said the retirement of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> meant `` we do n't really have a leader that unifies the whole movement.'' When he and <PERSON> Keene </PERSON> were asked to identify likely successors to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the leader of the conservative movement, the names they cited included <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, Sens. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, and columnist and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>. No one suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might succeed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the conservative hero.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should begin correcting `` the deplorable conditions on most Indian reservations'' by putting a someone in the White House in charge of issues affecting native Americans, say three senators who have been investigating those conditions. `` We urge you to consider our call for active and coordinated policy-making at all levels of the government, most notably at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, and the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and Justice,'' said Sens. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, in a letter Thursday to By putting someone at the White House in charge of Indian issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would `` send a signal throughout the Indian communities of your dedication to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first inhabitants,'' they said. The senators are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs and have been conducting special investigative hearings on a wide range of problems on reservations and within government agencies doing business with them. They said they wanted to meet as soon as possible with whomever <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> designates. The senators said their hearings will likely produce legislative proposals for correcting longtime deficiencies in government policies toward Indians. The White House could, in the meantime, get reform started, they said. In their letter, the senators said testimony before their committee casts doubt on whether the federal government is meeting its responsibility to protecting the rights of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> to their land, water, forest, hunting, fishing and mineral resources. `` As we are sure you will agree, legal representation is at the very core of the federal government's trust responsibility to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>,'' they said. `` The inherent conflicts facing the federal trustee arise not only in legal matters, but also in policy decisions.'' The president was in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Thursday for the funeral of the late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. There was no immediate response to the senators' letter from the White House

 High school principals enjoyed a 4.9 percent salary boost to an average of $ 52,987 this school year, reflecting what one official called a recognition that they are `` key players'' in the drive for better education. The lowest salary scale among senior high principals nationwide was $ 30,497, paid in one of the largest districts surveyed with at least 25,000 students, according to the survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>. The report was released Thursday at the principal group's annual meeting being held this week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Data on more than 1,000 school districts around the country was collected by the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a private, nonprofit research arm created in 1973 by the principals' association and several other education groups. Pay increases exceeded the 4.1 percent overall inflation rate for 1988, but were not as steep as the 6-7 percent salary increases of the preceeding four years. `` I think it represents the fact that principals are being recognized as key players in the drive for better schools,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersey </PERSON>, the association's director of professional assistance. <PERSON> Hersey </PERSON> pointed out that more school districts are trying `` school based management,'' where individual schools are freed to try different strategies with less outside interference. That kind of reform `` requires highly skilled leaders who are paid well,'' <PERSON> Hersey </PERSON> said. The survey calculated average salaries by school district size, but did not identify individual school districts, nor did it give state-by-state averages. Average pay for high school principals was $ 52,987, up from $ 50,512 a year ago. But the averages ranged from $ 55,991 in districts of 25,000 students or more to $ 47,612 in districts with enrollments of 300 to 2,499. <PERSON> Hersey </PERSON> said in an interview that the highest salary found in the survey was $ 86,500 for a senior high school principal in a district in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> with enrollment between 2,500 and 9,999 pupils. The survey also found that junior high and middle school principals averaged $ 49,427, up 5 percent from last year's $ 47,078. Elementary school principals' average pay rose 5.1 percent to $ 45,909 compared with $ 43,664 in 1987.

<HEAD>FSX Deal Prompts Call for Putting Commerce Secretary in NSC</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The handling of a controversial aircraft technology deal with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has prompted a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> congressman to call for making the secretary of commerce a statutory member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` I strongly feel the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must give more weight to long-term commercial interests in its national security decision-making,'' Democrat <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Thursday, explaining why he plans to introduce legislation next week. Critics of the deal involving <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s proposed <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> warplane _ to be built using technology developed for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighter _ contend it was negotiated by State and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> department officials without participation by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative and other agencies. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, faced with mounting concern on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to review the strategic, commercial and technological aspects of the project and submit a combined report to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> by March 10. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> testified at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on commerce, consumer protection and competitiveness. The panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, voiced serious concern over the <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> deal, under which <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would join forces with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to co-develop and co-produce the next-generation fighter. `` While this proposal may sound innocent, it could be troubling as far as our long-range national security is concerned,'' he said. `` Today, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, paying his respects on the death of of the emperor,'' he said. `` That is something he should do. But making massive amounts of sophisticated aircraft technology available to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, or anyone, is something that, quite possibly, the president should not do.'' Under current law, the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent membership comprises the president, vice president, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> and secretary of defense. Frequently, however, presidents designate other people as temporary members to participate in meetings on particular issues. Two former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, testifying before the panel, took differing positions on the advisability of going forward with the FSX deal. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Auer </PERSON>, now director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> and Cooperation at <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, argued that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> needs technologically superior fighters to help offset the threat posed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> force of 2,000 aircraft. <PERSON> Auer </PERSON>, who in 1979-88 served in the office of the assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for international security affairs, also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands to benefit from the FSX because `` state-of-the-art Japanese technology may well make the F-16 a better aircraft.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the Center for Security Policy, a Washington-based think tank, said he saw no new Japanese technology from which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should benefit. `` I, for one, am not persuaded that the co-cured composite wings and phased array radar technologies identified for ` flow-back' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the <ORGANIZATION> FSX </ORGANIZATION> deal meet that test,'' said <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, former deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for nuclear forces and arms control policy.

<HEAD>Tax Panel Rejects Bush Proposals on Medicare, Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> quickly turned down President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals to trim <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> costs by $ 5 billion and halve the capital gains tax rate. The panel, which has jurisdiction over tax and entitlement legislation, on Thursday approved a report by voice vote which said it has no intention of approving either of those requests from the new president. `` While the committee will work diligently in this area, it is not reasonable to expect providers or beneficiaries to absorb the level of reductions proposed by the administration in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program for fiscal year 1990,'' the committee report said. The report did not mention the capital gains tax directly, but nonetheless made clear the committee backed the position of Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal would violate the spirit of fairness in the income tax overhaul <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved in 1986 `` While it may be appropriate for the committee to examine selective income tax issues in the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the committee does not anticipate consideration of major income tax changes or re-opening of any fundamental feature of the 1986 Tax Reform Act,'' Thursday's report said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed cutting the tax rate on capital gains about in half, to 15 percent, contending the government would actually take in more money at the lower rate because of increased economic activity. Democrats and many economists say the proposal would be a revenue loser and a giveaway to the rich. Congressional analysts released a new estimate Thursday showing that after an initial jump in revenue next year, cutting the capital gains tax would reduce tax collections and cost the government $ 24.2 billion over the next six years. `` After an initial, and illusory, revenue gain, the president's proposal is shown for what it is, a tax break for the wealthy that will significantly increase the deficit,'' said <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, in a statement calling for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to withdraw the proposal `` It's a bad idea and should be discarded,'' he said. The administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agree the cost of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> has been soaring as the elderly population increases and medical fees grow faster than the general rate of inflation. Without restraints, the program would grow from $ 84.5 billion this year to $ 97.5 billion next year, according to White House estimates. In an effort to contain costs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his $ 1.16 trillion budget proposed holding <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending to $ 92.5 billion next year by imposing limits on payments to hospitals and doctors who treat <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients, and by cutting back the program's extra payments to teaching hospitals. `` If these modest reforms are adopted, the growth in Medicare payments between 1989 and 1990 will be reduced by $ 5 billion,'' the budget said. The committee, however, said it was not reasonable to expect either providers or recipients of Medicare to absorb the level of reductions proposed by the president, totalling $ 23.5 billion over three years. The new estimate on the capital gains tax, made by the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION>, differs sharply from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> estimates that the president's proposal would increase revenues by $ 9.3 billion during the 1989-94 period. `` Who's right?'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement Thursday. `` That's the first thing we'll have to determine when the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> takes this matter up.'' Unlike <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, who opposes any change in the rate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has indicated he could live with a reduction in the capital-gains rate if the upper-income taxpayers who would benefit most were made to pay elsewhere for the cut. Capital gains are profits from the sale property such as stocks and real estate. Before the 1986 law, they had preferential treatment in the tax code but now they are taxed the same as other income at rates of 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on total income.

<HEAD>Proposed Rule Change Would Speed Nuclear Plant Licensing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rule change being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> could help electric utilities get approval for new nuclear plants in half the time it currently takes, <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said the proposed change could be approved by the commission as early as next month. The licensing reform idea is strongly supported by the utility industry, which blames regulatory barriers for its current financial problems. Environmental groups oppose the change, saying it would limit their ability to challenge applications for construction permits and operating licenses. `` This would be a giant step forward,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said in an interview in his <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> office. He declined to speculate on whether the four other commissioners would vote for the rule change, which he said does not require congressional approval. The commisioners were briefed on the inch-thick document by their staff on Wednesday. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said he had not yet studied the document in enough detail to be sure he would support the plan, but he repeatedly expressed enthusiasm for such changes. The plan would make three major changes in the licensing process: _ Allow utilities to get federal approval for a plant site long before committing themselves to actually building on it _ Encourage manufacturers to develop standardized reactor designs This would allow utilities to choose a design already certified by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> and not requiring the current lengthy process of gaining design approval during the licensing process. _ Permitting utilities to get their plant construction permit at the same time as their operating license Currently this is a two-step process, and in some cases completed plants have stood idle because of failure to get an operating permit. `` The most important thing about this whole endeavor is to do as much up front in the whole licensing process as possible so you do n't have big major decisions for after the plant's been built,'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said. He said utilities would be able to get plants built and licensed within six years, and possibly sooner, compared with the recent average of 13 years. The utility industry contends that long delays in obtaining <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> licenses is one reason that no new nuclear plants have been ordered since the mid-1970s. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said that with the rule change, some orders might be placed in the early 1990s. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's designated energy secretary, told his confirmation hearing Wednesday that streamlining the nuclear plant licensing process `` could get things moving, could relieve the kind of constipation we have in the process now.'' Environmental groups, however, have been critical of the regulatory reform proposals. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotte </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is strongly critical of the industry and the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, said the rule changes would unfairly limit the public's right to fight a plant licensing. He said the main purpose of the changes was to aid the nuclear industry. `` For them there is no future without'' the streamlined process, <PERSON> Mariotte </PERSON> said in a recent interview, adding that his group might challenge the plan in court.

<HEAD>Bush S&amp;L Plan Facing Stiff Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to close or merge insolvent savings and loan institutions over the next 30 years at a cost of $ 265 billion is encountering stiff opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. After reading the 333-page bill submitted this week, both Democrats and Republicans who support a separate S & amp; L industry devoted primarily to home mortgages doubt it can survive under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal. `` There are too many officials within the administration who would just as soon see the home mortgage lending industry done away with,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill., and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s financial institutions subcommittee <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON> predicted that interest rates on home loans will rise dramatically if federally chartered S & amp; Ls are allowed to disappear, because the remaining financial institutions will not give such loans a high priority. That concern was bolstered Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who said his board is making it easier for bank holding companies to buy troubled <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and questioned `` whether specialized fixed-rate residential lending institutions are needed today.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that whatever survives will not be the traditional S & amp; L that relied on short-term deposits from savers to finance long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. `` My own judgment is that, at the end of the day, thrifts will look a lot more like banks than they do now, but there will still be thrifts,'' he said. `` Ultimately it's going to be the markets that are going to determine the banking structure in this country.'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, testifying Thursday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, defended that `` market approach'' and said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will stoutly resist congressional efforts to re-regulate S & amp; Ls by further restricting their lending activities. The failure of many S & amp; Ls has been blamed on imprudent and sometimes fraudulent loans for shopping centers, office buildings and other high-risk ventures after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deregulated the industry in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, with the backing of the industry, said he will try to amend <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to restrict 80 percent of future <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L lending to family housing within a 50-mile radius of each institution. He complained that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan requiring S & amp; L owners to put up more of their own capital to cover losses for non-residential lending `` does n't stop the crooks, it just makes them pay more to do business.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>'s proposal would put <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls `` back into the same box that we took them out of'' through deregulation when they had to pay more interest on deposits than they were receiving on home mortgages. He predicted that more of them would go bankrupt as a result, even while acknowledging that the healthiest third of the industry contains precisely those S & amp; Ls that have maintained their emphasis on home mortgages. The administration's plan would require S & amp; Ls with less than 60 percent of their loans in residential housing to become banks eventually. It also would place them under the control of federal banking regulators for the first time, require them to meet the 6 percent capital-to-asset requirements of banks within two years, and open the way for banks to take over failed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls immediately and healthy ones after two years. `` Rather than heal wounds, your plan may actually put it -LRB- the S & amp; L industry -RRB- out of its misery,'' Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., told <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> `` The banking regulators are going to make S & amp; Ls look more like banks and I'm concerned about the effect of that on housing.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> denied any `` intention on our part to deliver up the S & amp; L industry to the banking industry'' after contending earlier that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan `` assures the emergence of a healthy and strong S & amp; L industry.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, as the nation's lender of last resort, has entered into a support arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> system, which lends to S & amp; Ls `` We stand ready to make certain the liquidity needs of the thrift institutions are met,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said, referring to the record $ 15 billion in deposits that were withdrawn from them in November and December. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s financing proposal for protecting <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L depositors against losses `` should be adequate'' but conceded `` it's conceivable that there would be the need for a minor mid-course correction in a year or two. According to figures released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan calls for spending $ 265 billion through 2018: _ $ 52.2 billion to meet commitments made last year to rescue 205 institutions and prop up 17 others. _ $ 50 billion to shut down 350 more insolvent but still open S & amp; Ls through 1991. _ $ 89.2 billion through 2018 to pay the government's share of the interest on bonds sold to borrow the $ 50 billion. _ $ 73.4 billion to take care of additional S & amp; Ls likely to slip into insolvency between 1991 and 2018.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is leading to renewed calls in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the island nation to share more of the burden for regional defense in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` Our defense effort is 9.2 times greater than the Japanese effort, based upon the share of our respective gross national products we devote to defense,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Thursday. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer is wondering whether this division of effort is fair any longer.'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures showed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent $ 3.7 billion to maintain forces in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in fiscal year 1985, and $ 5 billion the following. Those figures were the latest available, though costs have undoubtedly risen, he said. While the Japanese have announced their 1989 defense budget will increase by $ 1.56 billion to $ 31.6 billion over the previous year, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said expenditures are actually declining as a proportion of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s GNP. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> on Thursday. He has stepped gingerly when addressing the military spending issue, saying that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is making adequate contributions to regional defense but that any moves to do more will be welcomed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Adm. <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the Japanese are `` well on their way'' to building up a force capable of defending the sea lanes out to 1,000 miles. But <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s military is no match for the Soviets, who `` operate literally in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s back yard,'' he said. Although the Japanese have done much to increase defense spending, `` I believe they can and should do more,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, was more outspoken. `` I'm getting sick of everyone trying to soak Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' he said, describing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as `` guarantor of stability throughout the world.'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said the American military presence is vital to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s security, yet <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bears many additional expenses in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> including those of maintaining 44,000 troops in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said he thinks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be given space for overseas bases rent-free so long as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> provides the troops and supplies. Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., questioned the need to keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, hinting that some might be withdrawn if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> faces tough budget choices `` I have n't figured out what the 44,000 troops are there for,'' he said. But <PERSON> Hardisty </PERSON> said a reduction of troops `` at this time would be premature'' in light of the continued threat from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 Midway through an extraordinary 2 -LCB- - hour <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> session, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said `` there may not be a smoking gun, but there's an abundance of smoke'' where Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is Within moments, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> uttered the scornful <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> reply: `` There may not be a smoking gun, but there's plenty of smoke That's a strange standard, my friends.'' Added the most junior senator on the committee, Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>: `` We are establishing a new standard ... that the weight of allegations, or of public perception, carries more weight than the facts.'' By the time the Democratic-controlled panel assembled in a packed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing room late Thursday, the outcome was already clear: Tower's nomination would be sent to the floor with a recommendation against confirmation, with the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to decide its fate next week. But that did n't stop all 20 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from participating in an exercise in speechmaking Thursday night as they struggled to explain their decisions. Republicans voiced alarm at a process in which so many lawmakers could read the same <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation files on Tower's alleged drinking, womanizing and financial conflicts of interest, and come to diametrically opposite conclusions along party lines. `` It seems that these things were orchestrated by somebody,'' said an exasperated Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, his voice rising. `` It is perception that is frightening this committee, it's not the truth,'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> said. `` This committee ought to have the courage to do what is right. Perception should not control this committee ... It ought to be the truth.'' Committee chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., listened intently, reminding the members that it was President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself who `` put ethics at the center of his agenda,'' and he said the decision on Tower had `` genuinely torn'' members of the panel But ultimately, said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, stories of Tower's drinking were too serious to ignore. `` I have searched in vain for several weeks for the point in time when the nominee himself acknowledged this problem and dealt with it decisively,'' he said. `` The nominee made it very clear that he has never sought medical assistance for his drinking problem.'' Other Democrats put different emphasis on the various allegations against Tower, but all said the end result was that they could not comfortably vote to put him in the chain of command over the nation's military and nuclear forces. They pointed to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports, saying the documents indicated Tower's acknowledged heavy drinking in the 1970s had extended into more recent times and that the evidence included first-person accounts. `` We should look elsewhere for a secretary of defense,'' said Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>., acknowledging that the confirmation process had been personally painful to Tower `` The system may not always be fair, but it works.'' Several Republicans, however, sounded a common theme: that in Tower's 24 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, none of his legislative colleagues ever saw him out of control, even in all-night sessions and on long overseas trips. `` I suppose <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> might have been able to conceal a problem'' from his colleagues, said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>. `` But it's highly unlikely.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the committee's senior Republican, said he had interviewed every current senator who had served with Tower. `` Not one single <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator ... can ever recall a single instance where any of his personal habits interfered with his duty,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. Republicans also emphasized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s right to select his Cabinet nominees, and said they gave a heavier weight to the new president's wishes Only eight presidential nominees for Cabinet positions have been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the nation's history. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committee members also suggested it was hypocritical for senators to reject a former colleague over his drinking habits. `` I wonder how many of us in this room would admit to the same proclivity, to have a social drink?'' asked Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss. `` This is not a canonization.'' Emerging from the hearing room after the vote, Republicans warned that the debate, at least, was not over. `` This is probably worth discussing and debating on the floor,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. `` There is a man here whose reputation has been dragged through the mire, and Republicans feel strongly about it ... I think it's a bad storm rising.''

 A military jury on Friday convicted a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain of dereliction of duty for failing to help a boatload of Vietnamese refugees who later resorted to cannibalism to survive _ then spared him a harsh sentence. Capt. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran, was sentenced to a reprimand. He could have been jailed for 90 days and ordered to forfeit two-thirds of his pay for three months. The jury acquitted <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, of the more serious charge of ordering one refugee shaken off ropes as he tried to climb aboard the warship. `` This court martial sentences you to be reprimanded,'' said the jury foreman, Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, after deliberating the sentence for about a half hour. Under military law, court martial convictions are automatically reviewed. The jury of six <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captains deliberated nearly six hours Thursday and Friday before returning a verdict. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, had been on trial since Feb. 10. He was stripped of his command of the amphibious landing ship USS Dubuque after being accused of failing to render adequate assistance to more than 80 Vietnamese boat people when the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> encountered them June 9 in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, 230 miles north of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said 31 of the Vietnamese died after encountering the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>. Survivors said they resorted to cannibalism to survive before Filipino fishermen rescued them on June 27. The jury found <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> guilty of dereliction of duty for failing to conduct an adequate inspection of the refugee boat; determine whether their sail was adequate; conduct appropriate medical examinations of visibly dehydrated refugees; provide necessary navigational equipment; provide adequate food and clothing to the naked, and take refugees aboard or see to it that they were taken aboard or assisted by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> supply ship in the area. The jury found <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> innocent of charges that he ordered the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>'s crew to shake off a refugee who tried to climb aboard the warship using the vessel's monkeylines. On Feb. 16, <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was acquitted of a third charge _ failing to render assistance to a Vietnamese who drowned. The prosecution contended <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> abandoned the refugees in his rush to resume his voyage to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` Providing humanitarian assistance is a mission of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' the prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, said during closing arguments. `` It was not Capt. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>'s mission. It was an interruption to his mission.'' <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said the Vietnamese left their homeland May 22 `` with the aim of escaping to freedom.'' They planned a four-day voyage to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> but were stranded when their engine broke down after three days at sea, he said. Food ran out and about 20 Vietnamese had already died when they encountered the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> pressed his executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Halter </PERSON>, to rush through an inspection of the refugee boat. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> testified he did not pick up the refugees because he did not realize how desperate their situation was. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> also testified that he believed the vessel was seaworthy based on reports from Halter. `` Only a fool would think this vessel could effectively sail anywhere,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, holding a photo of the boat jammed with emaciated Vietnamese. `` Only a fool can think these people are not in a life-endangering situation. Only a fool could really think food and water were all that was needed in this situation.'' In his summation, defense lawyer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> urged the jury to consider that <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> `` was honestly mistaken'' about conditions on the boat. `` It was a tragedy of errors,'' <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> said. `` If the skipper had learned there were ... dead bodies ... if he had known people were sick, he would have taken different actions. If he had known there was an inoperable engine, he would have taken a different action.'' <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was under pressure from his commanders to reach the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on schedule. The <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> took part in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security operations in the gulf during the final weeks of the Iran-Iraq war. `` Capt. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> was told to be there,'' <PERSON> Donato </PERSON> said. `` He was told, ` Do n't be late.'''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral Friday, taking a front-row seat as the Japanese waived protocol rules to give him a prominent position at the solemn <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> Imperial Garden ceremony. In the hours preceding the funeral, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attention was diverted by the continuing problems of Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>. The White House, despite heavy overseas calling, was unable to get the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It voted 11-9 to reject his nomination. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was sticking by Tower, no matter how the committee vote went. `` The next step is to consider it on the floor, and that's what we will do,'' he said. A steady rain fell and the weather was chilly as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and dignitaries from some 160 countries gathered for the funeral ceremony. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire in World War II, but said coming to the funeral was `` the right thing to do'' and that he did n't want to look back. Wearing dark mourning clothes and a black overcoat with the collar raised, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was seated with his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, on his right and West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsacker </PERSON> on his left. The floor below them was heated with electrical coils, and a brown wool blanket was placed on each chair. En route to the funeral site, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s motorcade crossed an overpass just as the funeral procession containing <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s hearse proceeded immediately below. During the briefing at the White House press filing center, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials hoped the Japanese would not be offended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s preoccupation with the Tower problem in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attention to his embattled <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary should not be construed by the Japanese as showing disrepect for their country on a national day of mourning. `` The timing is dictated by the work of the committee, not events over here,'' the press secretary said. More than 10,000 invited mourners from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and abroad were assembled at the <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> Imperial Garden. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unexpectedly was given a front-row seat as Japanese officials overrode protocol that would have seated the president on the basis of his time in office _ just a little over a month. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the last of the World War II era world leaders, died Jan. 7 of cancer at age 87 after reigning for six decades. After the funeral, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to his hotel and was there when an explosion damaged a highway along which the emperor's hearse was due to be taken after the cermony. Police speculated that radicals opposed to the emperor system were responsible for the blast. In a meeting with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> on Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` began by expressing the condolences of the American people'' upon <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Absent from the public ceremonies was Empress <PERSON> Dowager </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s 85-year-old wife, who is said to be ailing with chronic back and hip problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said she paid her last respects during the palace ceremonies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife walked together to the site of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s coffin and bowed in paying last respects, just before leaving the funeral grounds No disturbances were reported during the initial stages of Friday's funeral, but a police official in the southern city of <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> said a letter containing a bullet and a death threat was sent to city mayor <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON>, who had earlier charged that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> bore some responsiblity for World War II. During the news briefing earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> had discussed finding another candidate for the top Pentagon job. `` I can flatly say that. I do flatly say that,'' he said. `` I've talked to the president about that several times, including just 10 minutes ago There's no consideration of alternative candidates. There's no alternate list _ bar none.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday held talks with three <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> leaders, while Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> challenged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to pitch in with deeds instead of `` simply rhetorical exercises.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fast-paced diplomacy on the day of his arrival here involved meetings with a succession of world leaders including <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s round of meetings, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> suggested the Soviets should contribute to the peace process in a `` concrete way'' by establishing full diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, using its influence in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and denouncing `` radical countries'' such as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said a `` new dynamic'' for peace existed in the area and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hoped to nurture it. The president's sessions with <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> leaders provided a counterpoint to Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s 10-day tour through the region, where he attempted to advance <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s role. First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, donned a tailored black suit and an elegant strand of pearls to pay a visit <PERSON> Naoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the wife of the Japanese prime minister. The two women sipped tea at <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s official residence, with Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressing sympathy over <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death and the Mrs. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> offering congratulations on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election as president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s focus on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> during his first overseas trip _ a five-day visit to three <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> capitals _ appeared to be an effort to steal some of the spotlight from <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s journey to the area. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, briefing reporters after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s full day of meetings with world leaders, said Soviet overtures to participate in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace were `` healthy, quite frankly.'' But, he added, `` I suppose we would want to know that there were concrete contributions that they had in mind, rather than simply rhetorical exercises.'' He said he would have a better idea of what the Soviets intend when he meets with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in March in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said contributing to the new dynamics for peace were talks between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and statements by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> denouncing terrorism. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intended to be active in the peace process. However, he said ultimately a settlement would have to flow from `` direct negotiations between the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the Israelis.'' `` We are concerned that if we act too precipitously we might preempt promising possibilities that could surface if we adopted a more reasoned and measured approach,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added. Earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the subject of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement also came up in a lunch with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` We think there are some opportunities to move the -LRB- peace -RRB- process forward,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We want to be methodical and deliberate in our approach.'' On <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced concern that the withdrawal of Vietnamese there was proceeding `` at a slower pace than we would like to see,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also emphasized that we would like to see a government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that would involve Prince <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and would not see a return to the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' the spokesman said.

 An explosion Friday on a roadside embankment spilled dirt and debris on a highway in suburban <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> shortly before the motorcade carrying the body of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and the imperial family was to pass, police said. The incident did not stop the funeral motorcade, which passed the site later en route to the imperial mausoleums outside <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> where the emperor was to be buried, said an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> showed workers sweeping dirt off a section of six-line divided expressway in the western suburb of <LOCATION> Chofu </LOCATION> where the highway runs below ground level. The police official said the blast occurred about 15 minutes after the imperial motorcade left the funeral site in west-central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It was not immediately clear how far away the motorcade was when the blast occurred. Police had mounted the biggest security operation ever in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to protect the grand state funeral and about 9,000 mourners, including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and leaders from 162 other nations, attending the funeral. The police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he suspected radical guerrillas opposed to the imperial system were responsible for the blast. Several radical groups had vowed to disrupt the funeral. In 1986, about 30,000 police on duty during the seven-nation economic summit were unable to prevent guerrillas from firing two homemade projectiles at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> summit site. No damage or injuries resulted, but the attack seriously embarrassed the police. On Tuesday police said they found two projectile-launchers connected to timers in a forest near <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where many foreign dignitaries arrived to attend the funeral.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> should overturn the landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision because nothing in the Constitution guarantees the right to an abortion and such decisions should be left up to the states. `` Other Western countries have, through the legislative process, reached reasonable accommodations of the competing interests involved in the abortion controversy,'' acting Solicitor General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON> wrote in a brief filed Thursday with the high court. `` There is no reason to believe that American legislatures, if basic decision-making responsibility were returned to them, would not similarly arrive at humane solutions,'' he said. The brief, supporting the state of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s position in a case before the court known as <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services, said the case `` represents'' a proper occasion to reconsider <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. But the brief also acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> could rule on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case without touching the 1973 decision that legalized abortion. <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON> wrote that the <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> rests on the premise that `` there is a fundamental right to an abortion'' and that states `` do not have a compelling interest in protecting prenatal human life throughout pregnancy.'' `` Neither premise, however, is supportable,'' the brief said. Abortion rights and civil liberties groups condemned the department's action, while it was lauded by pro-life advocates. `` We're also appalled at the strength of the language, saying women do not have a constitutional right to make their own personal decisions about reproduction,'' said <PERSON> Tamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> contended that there is a constitutional right to an abortion. `` What <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> clarified was that the decision is a matter of privacy and that right is protect in the Constitution'' through the 4th Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. On the other hand, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that `` we applaud this intervention by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration in defense of unborn children.'' The Missouri case went to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on July 13 rejected key portions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law. About 20 briefs were filed in support of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law Thursday, the deadline for such briefs on that side of the issue. Advocates of the right to an abortion have another 30 days to file briefs. The court's decision is expected by July. In the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, the appellate court struck down these five provisions of the law: _ A ban on using public hospitals or other government-run facilities for abortions not necessary to save a woman's life _ A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or assisting an abortion _ A ban on using taxpayer money for `` encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions _ A requirement that doctors planning to abort a fetus believed to be older than 19 weeks test for weight and lung capacity to determine whether the fetus is capable of surviving outside the womb _ A declaration that `` the life of each human being begins at conception. The appeals court upheld a provision in the state law that bans the use of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion. But it said use of a public facility or the services of a public employee can not be banned if all such costs are reimbursed by a patient.

 The shades of <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Taney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caleb </PERSON> <PERSON> Cushing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> are being invoked as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> struggles once more with its constitutional power to advise and consent on nominations to the president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. This time the spotlight is on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s embattled choice to be secretary of defense Eight times in history, according to files of the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, presidents have failed to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation for people they had chosen to sit in the Cabinet. The last time was on Jan. 19, 1959, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 49-46 to reject President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> to be secretary of commerce. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> had survived by a vote of 9-8 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> but had made too many enemies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to clear the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In 1945, by contrast, the same committee rejected the nomination of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> as secretary of commerce by a vote of 14-5 on Jan. 26, but the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved it 56-32 on March 1. Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who had been asked by FDR to step down to make way for <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, opposed confirmation of the controversial former vice president and secretary of agriculture. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> had the backing, however, of organized labor. It was the last time a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> nomination before the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Thursday to reject the Tower appointment. The first president to have a Cabinet choice vetoed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose choice of <PERSON> Taney </PERSON> to be secretary of the treasury was turned down on June 23, 1834. <PERSON> Taney </PERSON>, who was already serving in the post by a recess appointment, was later named chief justice by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and confirmed for that post by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, whose relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were soured by his vetoes of major pieces of legislation, had four Cabinet choices rejected. His selection of Cushing to be secretary of the treasury was defeated three times in one day - March 3, 1843. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> later nominated <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> for the treasury post and he was rejected on June 15, 1844. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also rejected his nominations of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> for secretary of war on June 30, 1844, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henshaw </PERSON> for secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 15, 1844. Also rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanberry </PERSON> to be attorney general in 1868 President <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> as attorney general was rejected twice, on March 10 and again on March 16, 1925.

 An attorney for an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member convicted in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> of killing a British soldier says he's dismayed that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has injected himself into the controversy over whether his client should be granted political asylum. `` It's just more delay,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Somerstein </PERSON>, a New York-based attorney for <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>. `` The delay already has been interminable, and he's been incarcerated all through this. The length of his incarceration exceeds all bounds of fairness, of reasonableness.'' <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> has been in federal prison in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> since <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested him June 28, 1983, at <PERSON> Clancy </PERSON>'s Bar in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, where he worked as a part-time bartender after breaking out of a maximum security prison in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> more than six years ago. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> got involved in the case Thursday at the request of the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to deport <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the attorney general. At issue is a <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> decision last Nov. 14 that <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> could reopen his request for political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and remanding that request to an INS judge. If <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had not gotten involved, <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> could have pursued his case with the judge, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Since the attorney general can modify or overrule decisions of the board, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> could decide to deny <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> asylum without an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> judge hearing the case. `` We had requested that the attorney general not review it and just allow us our day in court to press our political asylum claim that the board said we should have,'' <PERSON> Somerstein </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It's tantamount to his being a judge in his own case,'' he said. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> was convicted with three others of the killing that occurred during a gunfight between <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members who had planned to ambush a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> patrol in 1980. He contends he is neither a terrorist nor a murderer, but a soldier engaged in war, and he is seeking asylum on the grounds that he would be subject to persecution if sent to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. On Thursday, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> ordered that <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> submit by March 27 a brief in support of its position. After that, <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> will have 30 days to submit a brief arguing his case, and then the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> will have 14 days to file a reply. The British have been seeking <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since 1983, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> raised the issue with then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during a 1986 visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprizzo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> denied <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s extradition request in December 1984, saying <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>'s crime was a political act and qualified him for political asylum The government appealed and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haight </PERSON> ruled in <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>'s favor. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> upheld <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>'s previous victories. Then the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began deportation proceedings. Since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent, <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> chose the independent Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Immigration Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> upheld that decision in 1986. Since then, the government has appealed three times and lost each time, the most recent loss coming last Nov. 14. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to revoke his concession that he was deportable after <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in December 1987 ratified the European Convention on Terrorism. The convention calls for mandatory extradition of those deemed terrorists and would have meant that <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> would have been extradited from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvell </PERSON> is so angry he would raise the roof if he had one. The trouble is, someone razed his house, and now he says he ca n't find the contractor who reduced the home to a pile of rubble <PERSON> Harvell </PERSON> said he hired an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> contractor simply to level the dirt around his house and push a fence down. Instead, his house, valued at $ 80,000 to $ 90,000, was demolished recently by the errant contractor. When he found out his house was being leveled, he ran to the man doing the work, <PERSON> Harvell </PERSON> said. `` The smell of liquor on his breath almost knocked me down,'' <PERSON> Harvell </PERSON> said. `` The man just kept saying ` I'm leveling, I'm leveling. `` He was drunk and said ` All right, there is no problem. I'll get my business partner and insurance papers and I'll be back in 15 minutes.' I never saw him again.'' <PERSON> Harvell </PERSON> has yet to find the contractor, and police ca n't locate him. Now he has retained an attorney and hired a private investigator to track down the contractor. <PERSON> Harvell </PERSON> wanted the lawn leveled so he could put in a sprinkling system and a new lawn. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Muchmore </PERSON>, who lives in the house, said he left to get some groceries and returned to find a heap. He said when he left `` the tractor was out front but the house was fine and all three doors were locked. When we returned the house was gone.'' A next-door neighbor, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, said she saw the house being mowed down. `` I knew that the owner owned a business and since this area is becoming a business district, we thought the owner was going to turn it into a construction yard or something,'' she said. `` But then I saw a bed and I thought something strange was going on.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> is drawing the Islamic curtain around <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> again, dragging it back into the self-imposed isolation from which more pragmatic leaders were seeking to lead it. His call on Moslems to kill British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for allegedly slandering Islam in his novel `` The Satanic Verses'' has alienated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at a time when figures like <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> were trying to present a more moderate image of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the world. Western countries were horrified when Iranian clerics last week offered a bounty of up to $ 5.2 million for the assassination of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who has gone into hiding with police protection in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The denunciation by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> of moves to normalize relations with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and of demands for political, social and religious reform now that the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has ended came on the heels of criticisms of the Islamic revolution's shortcomings by several rival Iranian leaders. `` He's happy when it's fortress <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, surrounded by enemies,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shahram </PERSON> <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said the Western reaction to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fury over `` The Satanic Verses'' has `` reinforced <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s belief that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is surrounded by a sea of corruption and conspiracies `` It was perfect for him. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> clearly thinks there's still some mileage out of a militant stand against the superpowers,'' <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The moves by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 88, are a major setback for the pragmatists, particularly <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, and a boost for hard-liners who feared <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was getting too powerful and believed restoring ties to the West would undermine the revolution. The 12 European Common Market countries have recalled their ambassadors to protest the death threats against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> while <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s hard-liners, have accused the West of ganging up on Islam and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in particular. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> also pulled their ambassadors out of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retaliated by withdrawing all its envoys from Common Market capitals. The British, who only normalized relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in December after a lengthy dispute, recalled their diplomats from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and said they will not return until the Iranians rescind their threats against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> `` and reject all forms of violence.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main European trading partner, has suspended plans to provide economic aid to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to help with postwar reconstruction and canceled scheduled visits by senior government officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Bonn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> branded <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> a `` declaration of war'' against Western culture that the revolutionary patriarch has so often denounced as morally repugnant. Hundreds of Dutch writers have called on their government to sever relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The Dutch Foreign Minister, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON>, called off a planned visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to protest `` an act of international terrorism.'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> declared Wednesday that the West's action in allowing `` The Satanic Verses'' to be published in the first place and their subsequent diplomatic moves proved that it was wrong for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to have tried to reestablish links. But <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> and other analysts questioned how long <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> can afford to keep <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> alienated from countries that it will need to help its massive reconstruction program that will cost an estimated $ 400 billion. It is money that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, exhausted by its 8-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war and poor economic condition, does not have and is not likely to have for years to come. `` But the real problem remains the power struggle within the hierachy,'' <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has slapped <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> down to size. But <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has been playing both sides, being very equivocal and has n't been decisive on important issues such as the economy and the constitution. He's been in a state of shock since he had to accept the cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> noted: `` One explanation is that he's siding with the radicals on this one after they were weakened by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s failure to defeat <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` He wants to keep an equilibrium between the opposing factions to uphold his own authority. He does n't want the revolution diluted.''

 Soul singer <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> has been cited for contempt of court and jailed for being $ 346,300 behind in child-support and alimony payments. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, whose recordings include the score for the movie `` Shaft,'' was told Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Etheridge </PERSON> that he can get out of jail only by coming up with $ 22,000.

 A huge jump in disciplinary actions at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> does not necessarily indicate the degree of abuse by commodities traders, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON>, assistant comptroller general at the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an agency that is an investigating and auditing arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said results of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into commodities trading may give a better idea of abuse at the board and the exchange. The testimony came Thursday at the first <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> oversight hearing of the year on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a federal agency which faces reauthorization by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> says the number of contracts traded at the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> grew from 40 million in 1984 to 80 million in 1988, and at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> from 80 million to 140 million during the same period. In that same period, the number of traders sanctioned for violations on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> went from 13 to 105, while sanctions at the Board of Trade went from a low of eight in 1985 to a high of 32 in 1986. In 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> sanctioned 13 floor participants. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> said that from 1984 to 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fines for trade practice abuses were a total $ 3.6 million. For the same period, comparable <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> fines were $ 811,000. <PERSON> Fogel </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the figures could mean that an oversight system is working well, or that it needs improvement because it is not finding abuses or punishing offenders severely enough.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the emperor-god made mortal by a disastrous war, was honored Friday at a tradition-steeped state funeral attended by the largest number of world leaders gathered together in modern times. An explosion on a roadside embankment marred the day, spilling dirt and debris on a highway shortly before the motorcade carrying the emperor's body and the imperial family was to pass, police said. The motorcade, bound on a chilly, rainy day for the imperial burial site west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, passed the area where the blast occurred without incident. Police said they suspected radicals who oppose the imperial system were responsible. Several such groups had vowed to disrupt the funeral, for which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s police mounted their biggest security operation ever. At the funeral service, 51 black-robed bearers carried atop a one-ton bier the body of the emperor who died in January at age 87 after a reign of 62 years that spanned <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rise to militarism, its defeat in World War II and its ascent as a world economic power. `` The people will remember him forever,'' said his son and the new emperor, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, in a eulogy before leaders of 163 nations, including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. A deep-voiced male chorus sang a solemn song, a poem was read and members of the imperial family went individually before the coffin and bowed slowly. After the eulogies, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, stepped to the front of the hall, paused and made a slight bow before the coffin. The capital, a sprawling metropolis of 12 million people, came to a standstill as 32,000 police were deployed to protect the dignitaries. Police said the highway blast occurred about 15 minutes after the imperial motorcade left the funeral site in west-central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It was not immediately clear how far away the motorcade was at the time of the blast. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Early in the day, a black hearse carrying the emperor's lace-draped coffin drove at 6 mph through central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> along a four-mile route from the moated Imperial Palace to the funeral site at <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> Imperial Garden Police said about 210,000 people lined the streets. Some people cried as the motorcade passed, and others held their palms together in prayer. Members of the royal family carried umbrellas in the streaming rain and wind. Trailing the coffin, a chamberlain dressed in white carried a platter with a pair of white shoes that tradition says the deceased monarch will wear to heaven. Mourners filled the two huge tents built at the garden for the funeral. Officials overrode protocol to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a front-row seat, although tradition would have put him toward the back because of his short time in office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire in World War II, but said he decided to come to the funeral because it was the right thing to do because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are allies. Also bowing before the coffin was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran of World War II, who was present at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surrender ceremony in 1945 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said in his eulogy that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` will continue to strive mightily to ensure that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is open to the rest of the world, full of vigor, and culturally rich, and will further promote the cause of world peace and human welfare.'' He described <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s reign as `` eventful and turbulent times for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, including the calamities of that deplorable war, the struggle to reconstruct itself from the ruins amid confusion and dire poverty and to regain its full independence.'' About 400 demonstrators from three leftist groups gathered peacefully at a park in west-central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, carrying banners denouncing the funeral and branding <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> a `` war criminal.'' `` <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s war responsibility is great. He died without ever resolving it,'' said a 30-year-old woman wearing a mask and sunglasses at the rally. Historians generally agree that most of the decisions about the war were made by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s military leaders and that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was largely powerless. He relinquished his divine status under the constitution imposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the war. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was to be buried near the grave of his father, <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION>, about 30 miles outside the city. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, in a black tailcoat, black gloves and gray trousers, and a black-veiled Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> were shielded by umbrellas as they left the palace for the funeral motorcade. A 21-gun salute boomed from howitzers, mingling with ancient court music played on pipes and drums. Crowds up to 10 deep watched the motorcade as it pulled out of the main gate of the palace, moved across the moat and along its route. The 13 hours of funeral ceremonies began with two hours of private Shinto ceremonies presided over by the <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 55, who ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne after his father's death. The body of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who died of cancer Jan. 7, was encased in an inner wooden coffin and an outer one of metal. Before the procession, officers joining the largest security operation in Japanese history checked cars and patrolled streets. Absent from the public ceremonies was Empress <PERSON> Dowager </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s 85-year-old wife, said to be ailing with back and hip problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said she paid her last respects during the palace ceremonies. Stores in the <LOCATION> Ginza </LOCATION> shopping district covered their advertising signs and display windows. Most businesses along the procession route were closed. Many of the dignitaries used Thursday for mini-summit meetings. They included <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is on his first trip overseas as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief executive. The government proclaimed Friday a holiday, asking Japanese to `` suitably mourn'' <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and observe a minute of silence at noon. To mark the funeral, the government pardoned 30,000 people convicted of minor criminal offenses. The pardons allow an additional 11 million people to recover such civil rights as the right to vote and run for public office, which they had lost as a punishment for their offenses. A 72-year-old farmer, <PERSON> Morie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiroki </PERSON>, tried to commit suicide by ritual disembowelment, or harakiri, in <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Kennosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumae </PERSON> said by telephone. He said <PERSON> Hiroki </PERSON>, who slashed his abdomen with a kitchen knife, was in serious condition in the hospital. The spokesman said <PERSON> Hiroki </PERSON> had served in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in World War II and left a note saying he felt he had to follow the emperor in death.

<HEAD>Smoking Promotes Unhealthy Distribution Of Body Fat, Study Says</HEAD>

 People who smoke to control their weight are simply redistributing their fat and putting themselves at risk for potentially deadly illnesses, according to a study published today. Smoking does reduce weight, the researchers acknowledged, but flab stays around the waist, increasing the chance for heart disease, diabetes _ and early death. `` If you're a cigarette smoker who is continuing to smoke in order to control your body weight, or a non-smoker considering starting up again ... you're making a bad decision,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON>, a co-author of the study and clinical director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` There's no question that the risk of cigarette smoking is much greater than the risk of a few -LRB- excess -RRB- pounds of body weight,'' he said. Cigarette smokers generally weigh less for their height than non-smokers and typically gain weight if they quit, the researchers acknowledged in their report in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. But in looking at the ratio of waist size to hip size in men over a period of 26 years, the researchers found that waist sizes generally were larger in relation to hip size among smokers than non-smokers. Mean measurements among smokers were 35.7 inches at the waist and 39 at the hips, compared with a mean ratio of 35.7 to 39.5 among non-smokers, the researchers said. The more a person smokes, the larger the comparative waist size, the study found. While the difference between the two ratios is small, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> said previous studies have indicated this can have a big effect on risks of heart disease. `` If you are fortunate enough to be shaped with the fat down around the hips, then you have a relatively safe form of obesity,'' <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> said. `` You are less likely to have high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. `` It's simply one more bad effect of cigarette smoking _ as if you needed one more bad effect.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based group representing the tobacco industry, said he had not seen the study and had no comment. How smoking causes differences in fat distribution is unclear, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> said, but cigarettes could affect hormones or could have a drug-like effect on their own. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> said no data on smoking and body-fat distribution is available for women, but `` one can hypothesize that women will show the same sort of changes'' as men. The researchers also found that when smokers in the study gave up tobacco, they gained an average of five pounds, but the ratio of waist size to hip size did not increase significantly. Ex-smokers who took up the habit again lost an average of 2.2 pounds, but the ratio of waist size to hip size increased, meaning there was a greater increase in waist size. The survey tracked 1,122 men between the ages of 19 and 102 between 1960 and 1986. The researchers measured the subjects' height, weight, waist size and hip size and tracked changes in measurements and smoking status at two-year intervals Smoking-related deaths claim 390,000 Americans annually, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which says smoking is linked to lung cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, emphysema, and various cancers.

 Malaysian and <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> soldiers will be among troops sent to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to keep the peace this spring under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan that is to guide the territory to independence after 74 years of South African rule. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved a plan under which troops and civilians from 23 countries will help transform <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> into a sovereign state. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> votes on allocating $ 416 million for the one-year operation. Under accords signed in November, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> promised to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> promised to withdraw from neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by mid-1991 the 50,000 troops helping that country's Marxist government fight U.S.-backed rebels. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team begins work April 1 and will monitor elections set for November in which Namibians will choose a constituent assembly that is to organize an independent, black majority-ruled government. The mission will send 4,650 military peacekeepers, 500 police supervisors, more than 760 civilian <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staff, 820 locally hired staff and 620 election monitors to the territory also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> may dispatch a total of 7,500 troops if necessary. The initial deployment was limited as a cost-cutting measure at the insistence of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which together pay 57 percent of all peacekeeping costs.

They will include civilians from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> had been expected to contribute troops, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> vetoed Swedish participation, fearing the Swedes would not be impartial. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> objected to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s longstanding support for the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla force that has been fighting for independence since 1966 and is expected to win a majority in the constituent assembly.

<HEAD>Activist Says FBI Improperly Investigated Him for 30 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A civil rights activist who was one of the last Americans to serve prison time for contempt of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> era has moved to overturn his conviction, based on an uncovered <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> memo. A petition filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Thursday asks that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s contempt-of-Congress conviction be set aside. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s lawyers argue that the government deliberately concealed evidence that a crucial witness who testified against <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> was considered unreliable. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, now 74, first came to the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> during the 1940s when he led a move to integrate public housing in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He and fellow integrationist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> were the last of 36 Americans sent to jail for clashing with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Un-American Activities. A newly released <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> memo, which remained classified until last year, shows the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> knew in 1961 that <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, the woman who accused <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> of being a Communist, had `` exhibited emotional instability'' at a 1955 hearing. Therefore, the 1961 memo said, information on <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s alleged <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> membership `` comes from sources not considered advisable to use as government witnesses.'' Nonetheless, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> used Ms. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>'s testimony that she knew <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> as a fellow Communist party member in rejecting an appeal by <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> on a 5-4 vote. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> eventually served nine months of a one-year prison term for refusing to answer the questions of the house committee. `` We have a government which had in its possession information that clearly related to the reliability, the credibility, of the only witness whose testimony was used to convict <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> of contempt of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We believe that in fact a fraud was perpetrated by the government upon the judicial system,'' <PERSON> Mirell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>'s court petition invokes a procedure used when new evidence comes to light following a conviction. It was filed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>. He obtained the memo about Ms. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> as part of the settlement of his 15-year-old lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, seeking information the agency had gathered about him and his group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The whole course of First Amendment law has been affected by it,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we have here is the government, by its affirmative misrepresentation, in fact distorting the whole course of constitutional history.''

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> crowd at an American state funeral would have been different. Americans would have come equipped with binoculars. Americans would have made some noise. Americans would have brought the children. Americans would have gotten acquainted with their neighbors and chatted about the cold rain, saying they wished they had worn long underwear. No American crowd would have been so capable of sitting so still as long the Japanese did today at the funeral for their emperor. The visiting American dignitary, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was surrounded by 9,800 Japanese, oblivious to him and demonstrating in every way the differences between their two societies. In this nasty, wet cold, Americans would have clapped their hands together to warm up, dabbed handkerchiefs to runny noses and stomped their feet. The Japanese did none of that, sitting motionless in silence for four hours or more, talking in whispers if they talked at all. Americans would have huddled under the brown, furry blankets that were provided for every Japanese guest at the funeral. The Japanese used the blankets as tidy lap robes. In their hands some of them held little bags filled with a chemical. When the bags are shaken, they emit a small amount of heat, enough to warm a hand. One Japanese woman shook her bag and slipped it into her shoe. The crowd at the Imperial Garden assembled under two enormous open-sided white tents. Most were too far away to see the proceedings, but still able to watch seven giant television screens that carried a fuzzy picture of what was going on before them. Here was <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s elite: members of the parliament, of the national and local governments, leaders of the giant corporations that are household names around the world. Over and over, bows were exchanged. A person taking his seat would first bow to those he recognized in his row. These were deep bows, from the waist straight down, nothing held back, nothing merely symbolic about them. Many acquaintances would bow upon seeing each other, shake hands, bow again. Those who arrived early and took their seats rubbernecked at the late arrivals. Latecomers offered bows and were bowed to in return. Those already in their seats often bowed without rising. No public tears were shed here. The crowd was somber, stoic, not grief-stricken. But nothing prepared an American visitor for the change in mood around the corner. Some of the mourners slipped away to another wing of the tent for a paper cupful of tea, served by young women in black suits, for a smoke, for conversation, for a break. The air was dense with cigarette smoke, noisy with chatter. Men _ few women ventured in _ stood around tables which carried only one thing: an ashtray. The visitors huddled around gas stoves to warm up for a few minutes. The atmosphere was almost like that of a political convention, but with the eternal bow substituting for backslaps.

 Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> denied any wrongdoing after being indicted on a misdemeanor charge that he had sex with a teen-age girl. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, a Republican, was indicted Thursday by a <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury on a charge of contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a child. The first-degree misdemeanor carries a maximum jail term of 180 days and a $ 1,000 fine. The charge resulted from an investigation prompted by a secretly videotaped meeting last November between <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> and the girl's mother, who contended <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> paid for sexual relations with her daughter on two occasions One of those times allegedly was four years ago when the girl was 13. The grand jury accused <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> of having sexual intercourse with the girl on Nov. 6, when she was 16, in his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment. `` I do categorically deny that I contributed to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor at any time, and I further categorically deny the accuracy of the alleged facts upon which the charge was apparently based,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office. `` I am innocent of the charge brought forth today.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, 58 and divorced, said his attorney had advised him against commenting on the allegations beyond his brief statement. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> did not testify before the grand jury, which did not ask him to appear, <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. No date for an initial court appearance was set for <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has jurisdiction over allegations of wrongdoing by lawmakers, typically waits for the outcome before taking any action in cases where members have been charged in court. A criminal conviction does not automatically bar a legislator from sitting in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Columbus television station <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 1 broadcast a videotape that shows <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> apparently offering a job to <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> after she asked him why he was `` messing around'' with her daughter. The station said it videotaped the Nov. 11 meeting between <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> at a fast-food restaurant in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and prosecutors reviewed the tape and said they found no evidence of bribery. The grand jury heard testimony from the girl, Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> and at least two women who said they saw <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> with the girl in his apartment. Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> WDTN-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> following the indictment, said she had hoped the grand jury would have returned a more serious charge. `` I expected more because this is a very serious matter,'' Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said. `` What kind of impression does it have on our children, our future?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s daughter said she thinks an appropriate penalty would be to see <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> go to jail and no longer be a congressman. `` It's like a hurt right underneath my heart,'' the daughter said. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1966 and served two terms. He lost a bid for governor in the 1970 Republican primary. After that race, he was barred from seeking public office for five years for not filing campaign reports on time. That campaign law was changed before the five-year period expired, and he was appointed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 to fill an unexpired term. He returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986.

 A military jury spared a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> navy captain serious punishment after convicting him today of failing to help Vietnamese boat people who resorted to cannibalism to survive. The jury of six <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captains could have jailed <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> for 90 days and made him forfeit two-thirds of his pay for three months. Instead, they gave the decorated Vietnam War veteran a reprimand, saying he erred last June 9 while his ship was in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> but deserved no further punishment than to be relieved of command, as he was in August. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, claimed he had been made a scapegoat over the incident and that `` heroes like me are hung out to dry when they get in trouble.'' The jury had acquitted him of the more serious charge of ordering one refugee shaken off ropes as he tried to climb aboard the amphibious landing ship USS Dubuque. The jury deliberated nearly six hours before returning a verdict. It took a half hour to decide on the sentence. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was accused of failing to render adequate assistance to more than 80 Vietnamese refugees in a leaky boat the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> encountered about 250 miles north of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said 31 of the refugees later died. Survivors said they had devoured the dead to survive before Filipino fishermen rescued them on June 27. The jury found <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> guilty of dereliction of duty for failing to conduct an adequate inspection of the refugee boat; determine whether its sail was adequate; conduct appropriate medical examinations of visibly dehydrated refugees; provide necessary navigational equipment; provide adequate water and clothing to the naked, and take refugees aboard or see to it they were taken aboard or assisted by a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> supply ship in the area. The prosecution had claimed <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> abandoned the refugees in his rush to resume his voyage to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> took part in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> security operations during the final days of the Iran-Iraq war. The defense argued that he was under pressure from his commanders to reach the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> served as mother ship for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> minesweepers and provided a backup force of 400 Marines. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> testified he did not pick up the refugees because he did not realize how desperate their situation was. He also said he believed the refugees' vessel seaworthy based on reports from the ship's executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Halter </PERSON>. After the sentence, <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> told reporters he accepted responsibility for his decision but called the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation unfair. He said an initial probe had cleared him of wrongdoing but that the second investigation was conducted by an officer of whom he had been critical. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> also said at least four members of his crew should be court-martialed for their actions. He did not identify them. `` In hindsight, I should have done it different,'' <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> said. He said the refugee problem was `` politically messy for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> because no matter how you look at it, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was embarrassed.'' The captain also said there had been insufficient emphasis `` on what really happened on that junk, why two young children were allowed to die and why three were murdered and all five eaten. Where is the accountability for that?'' He said the jury was `` as fair as they could be, but the dirty procedures to get me to court martial are sickening.'' <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> took command of the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, a 16,500-ton vessel based in <LOCATION> Sasebo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in May 1987 and was relieved of command last August. He said he had received a new assignment as assistant chief of plans at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s telecommunications command in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but did not know whether he would stay in the service. The captain denied prosecution allegations he did not care about the fate of Vietnamese refugees. `` I fought for them,'' he said. `` We fought and were wounded because we cared about the Vietnamese. God knows this did n't come out well and I'm accountable, I'm responsible.'' In 1966, <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> won the Silver Star, the third highest military award for valor, and a Purple Heart for wounds because he saved members of his crew after their river patrol boat was caught in a Viet Cong night ambush. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON> later served a second tour in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> aboard a destroyer. His tours of duty since have included command of the ammunition supply ships USS <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> and USS <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION>, and the amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu.

<HEAD>Bison Hunt An Experience Of A Lifetime For Some; For Others, A Disgrace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVINGSTON, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hunters call it the experience of a lifetime, a trophy retrieved from the long-ago days of the American frontier; critics call the century's first large-scale buffalo hunt a slaughter and a disgrace. More than 15 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> buffalo herds have already been killed this winter as they wandered beyond the park's boundaries to forage, victims of a state law that permits the shootings to avert the spread of disease to cattle. A total of 500 likely will be killed by Monday. And the state was mailing letters today to 250 hunters, notifying them that they can come to <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to shoot their buffalo if the beasts cross into <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. `` If any animal, even a bloodthirsty <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> hunter, could be a part of this and say it's exciting, it's such stupidity that I ca n't believe it,'' said <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> <PERSON> Amory </PERSON>, president of the Fund for Animals in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` This is no longer a hunt, it's a massacre.'' East Coast animal-rights activists are not the only people critical of the hunt. <PERSON> Ellery </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrell </PERSON>, a 73-year-old rancher who has lived his entire life in <LOCATION> Tom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> about 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, said it was sickening to watch the buffalo fall. `` They're about as smart as a damned old milk cow,'' <PERSON> Merrell </PERSON> said of the bison. <PERSON> Merrell </PERSON> said he had nine buffalo on his property Wednesday morning. He allows no buffalo hunting, but the animals are killed when they cross the road to other property, he said. Its legendary lack of intelligence notwithstanding, the buffalo fascinates hunters and wildlife lovers equally. The stubborn, shaggy giants represent the frontier lost 100 years ago. Many of the hunters, most of them Montanans who have hunted all their lives, call the bison hunt an experience they will never forget. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON>, R-Mont., said he had looked forward to killing a bison with his .44 - magnum pistol, but was unable to get away for `` I think that both the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the state are acting in a responsible manner,'' <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON> said. `` There are too many buffalo in the park. The harvest of those buffalo is a humane harvest of animals that would otherwise starve to death.'' For the state of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, however, it's an economic issue. About half of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s bison carry brucellosis, a disease which some scientists say could be transmitted to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> cattle herds. Brucellosis causes cows to spontaneously abort their calves. Herds could be quarantined if the disease should start to spread. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> cited that concern when it decided in 1985 to allow hunters to kill bison entering <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The previous winter, state wildlife officials shot 88 bison in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to control brucellosis. But <PERSON> Louisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> dismissed disease as a justification for the hunt, saying cattle in the area are vaccinated against it. `` Theoretically, it's certainly possible,'' she said of the disease risk. `` Realistically, it's not.'' Once numbering in the millions, the buffalo faced extinction by late in the 19th century. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s buffalo herd has rebounded from fewer than 50 at the turn of the century to about 2,700 last winter. Park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> said that even if all 750 hunters on the state's list were to kill a bison, the survival of the Yellowstone herds and the species is not at all threatened by the biggest hunting death toll of the century. <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON> also said there wo n't be another year like this one soon. Large numbers of buffalo are being killed this year because recent mild winters allowed the survival of many animals that normally would have died. Last year only 39 bison were shot. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> originally chose 250 names of hunters from those who applied for $ 200 bison tags at the beginning of the current season Oct 1. Another 250 were called in January, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Fish, Wildlife and <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 A female doctor and a 14-year-old girl may have been raped before they were killed in an army massacre at a rebel field hospital, a human rights group says. Ten people, included wounded rebels, were slain in the Feb. 13 attack on the hospital by an elite army battalion, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s Legal Aid office said Thursday. The office, a highly respected human rights organization in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said the doctor's body bore 10 bullet wounds and the teen-ager's body six. It said both were severely bruised on the inner thighs and breasts. Radio Venceremos, the guerrillas' clandestine station, reported on Feb. 15 that troops of the Atlacatl Battalion attacked and destroyed the field hospital two days earlier. It said six people, three medical workers and three wounded guerrillas, were killed. Both the Legal Aid office and the rebel radio identified the female victims as <PERSON> Alejandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, a 35-year-old Mexican physician; and <PERSON> Rosibel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubon </PERSON>, 14, a paramedic's aide. Their bodies were exhumed and examined Feb. 17 by the Legal Aid office. The alleged massacre took place outside the village of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Encuentros </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Sumpul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that forms <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Encuentros </LOCATION> is located, is a stronghold of leftist rebels waging a 9-year civil war against the U.S.-backed government. Col. <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, military commander of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>, told reporters Thursday there was no field hospital near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Encuentros </LOCATION>. But he said Atlacatl troopers killed several guerrillas, including the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> doctor, in combat Feb. 13. `` They were treating one wounded subversive,'' said <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>. `` But it was not a field hospital. There was n't even a hut there.'' Legal Aid concluded a field hospital was in fact installed near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Encuentros </LOCATION>, and that Atlacatl troops `` attacked and destroyed the field hospital and killed war wounded and the medical personnel present.'' Legal Aid said in addition to the doctor and girl, five wounded guerrillas and three other medical aides were killed in the Atlacatl attack. `` Because the bodies of the two women were completely nude and both were bruised around the breasts and on the inside of the thighs, rape or attempted rape is presumed,'' the report said. The church office called the attack `` a flagrant violation'' of the Salvadoran Constitution and of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. The alleged massacre took place 10 days after a visit to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> delivered what he called a very emphatic message to the effect that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> expected the Salvadoran armed forces to improve their human rights record.

 Sikh gunmen crept into a Sikh farming family's sleeping quarters near <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> and killed a father and his four sons, a senior police official said today. Police blamed the same group of six separatists for a second attack Thursday night in a nearby village in which another Sikh was killed. More than 300 people have been killed so far this year by Sikh extremists, who have for seven years waged a bloody guerrilla war against the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> government for a separate homeland. The gunmen forced their way into the house of <PERSON> Amrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 65, and opened fire on the male members with Chinese assault rifles, Police Superintendent G.S. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s wife and the wives of two of his sons were herded into the next room during the shooting, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. He said the attack occurred in <LOCATION> Rampur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The tents were empty, the applications lay blank and all was quiet on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border today, but immigration authorities warned that thousands of Central Americans were `` lying low'' and hoping for a lapse in tighter federal restrictions. `` I do n't think they will stop coming,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bautista </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez-Sanchez </PERSON>, a Nicaraguan who was detained after his application for asylum was denied. He said he left home after being arrested and beaten for marching against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. `` They will be coming not only for economic reasons, but for political reasons and I think they will come if I tell them that even if they get put in jail here, they will not get beaten up,'' he said. But for now, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s tough new asylum policy has achieved its goal: a sharply reduced flow of Central Americans across the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border. Patrol officers all along the border said the policy has not yet resulted in an increase in illegal immigration, despite rumors that immigrants were shifting their point of entry westward to <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. `` We're keeping an eye on the situation,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Arras </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. Border Patrol officers in <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> also said they had seen no unusual activity. But many Central Americans are presumed to be in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, waiting their turn to make it past Border Patrol checkpoints and to their destinations in the interior. `` They are not stupid. They're lying low,'' said <PERSON> Silvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> chief for the <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION> sector. `` They're probably with a sympathizer, on their own or with an alien smuggler in hs through the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> around <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, including 40,000 who have sought political asylum. To control that flow, an army of <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> workers and additional border patrol officers descended on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border this week to carry out the tougher rules for asylum-seekers. At the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where an influx of asylum applicants was expected, giant tents were pitched to house detainees and dozens of typewriters were shipped to process applications. So far, none of the tents and few of the typewriters have been needed. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officers processed 233 applications for asylum on Tuesday, the first day of the new policy, but just 51 on Wednesday and 10 on Thursday. Only two of the more than 300 applicants were granted asylum. `` Nobody is coming to apply for asylum and that's sort of predictable when 99 percent of these folks are being thrown in jail here, so obviously people are going underground and they are not going to be going through the system anymore, which is a tragedy,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, an attorney with the Harlingen-based <ORGANIZATION> Proyecto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libertad </ORGANIZATION>, which represents Central Americans. Under the old <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> procedures, immigrants applying for asylum had to wait weeks while their applications were processed, during which they were released on their own recognizance. Under the new policy, applications are processed on the spot but those whose applications are denied are being held on bonds between $ 1,000 and $ 4,000. They are housed at an indoor detention center at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION>, 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, or at a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter near the Texas-Mexico border. Thursday night, more than 400 people stayed at the shelter, only 130 of whom were sent by the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. The others showed up on their own to await processing of their applications, according to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, deputy commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>. Buck said immigration agents are posted at the shelter but not in an adversarial role. `` We want these people to have a place to stay. We do n't want them out in the streets,'' he said. `` We will have daily roll call, but we wo n't have any ... heavy armaments and they'll have free movement.''

<HEAD>Hospitals Form Day-Care Programs For Ailing Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When little <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> has a cold, her working parents can depend on increasing numbers of hospital day-care programs with such names as `` Sniffles and Sneezes'' and `` Under the Weather.'' Springing up nationwide in the past five years, day care for mildly ill children in hospitals and independent infirmaries is catching on. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, about a dozen hospitals offer the service, according to the state Office for Children. The trend prompted the state agency to study the need for such health care and to come up with alternatives that suit both anxious workers and employers concerned about lost productivity when staff members stay home. The day-care infirmaries generally take youngsters recuperating from the run-of-the-mill childhood illnesses. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterne </PERSON>, a pediatrician in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> who is on a national panel working on standards for such care, said mixing hospitals with day care came about because hospitals had vacant beds and needed to keep nurses on the job when their own children were ill. <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> McAndrew </PERSON>, the nurse manager of pediatrics at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, runs the hospital's 2-year-old `` Sniffles and Sneezes'' A room at the end of the pediatric floor accommodates up to five children with beds and a play area that includes board games and a television set. The program accepts children from six weeks to about 12 years of age. While the number of days is unlimited, they can remain in care for no more than 10 hours a day. The cost is $ 2.50 an hour, lunch included. Parents are required to stay with their children about 15 minutes before depositing them in an effort to ease the transition. `` It's run by a hospital, in a hospital but they're not treated like they're in the hospital,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> McAndrew </PERSON>, who added the program averages two to three children at a time. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandell-Zimmer </PERSON> is a nursing supervisor at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s. Last year, when she worked elsewhere and did n't know about Sniffles and Sneezes, Ms. <PERSON> Mandell-Zimmer </PERSON> said she missed three days of work for her own illness but more than four weeks caring for her baby son, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON>, when he was too sick to go to day care. In January, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> was recovering from a fever and flu symptoms when she took him to the unit at work for one day and was relieved of the worries working parents usually face with a sick child. `` You feel guilty trying to send your child to day care knowing they really should n't be there,'' she said. `` But if you do n't have any vacation time saved up, you miss a day's pay. And it does n't look good on your record. With the hospital day care, she said, she had no such concerns. `` It's what money can not buy, and it's cheaper per hour than a babysitter,'' she said. A report in Pediatrician Magazine calculated that businesses lose six to 29 days annually per parent of children under age 6 who are out sick, at a cost ranging between $ 2 billion and $ 12 billion, according to <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, chairperson of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Childcare </ORGANIZATION> task force of the Office for Children. <PERSON> Sterne </PERSON> said he strongly opposes the notion of a hospital unit for day care unless it is segregated from the hospital setting and uses staff whose primary training is in early childhood education. `` This is the kind of issue that gets parents very emotionally involved,'' Ms. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. `` It's new. Parents are uncertain of it.'' Like <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> already have or are completing regulations on such health care for children, she said. `` You're going to see another half dozen states in the next two years developing this kind of regulation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> said. In the meantime, she said, `` There are no state implemented standards, so parents have to look at whether they're good for their child.''

 City councilors who asked the city's Law Department how to go about driving snakes from this heavily Irish city got an answer harking back to the old sod `` We have thought of suggesting you hire a consultant but the only person we are aware of who successfully drove snakes out of an area apparently retired a long time ago,'' city lawyers said in a recent unsigned memo, referring to the legend of St. Patrick driving the snakes from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The councilors made the request a few weeks ago because of complaints about a pet python on the loose in a residential neighborhood. The nine-foot python disappeared three months ago and has n't been seen since. The city lawyers' went on to suggest in their memo that the councilors visit the St. Patrick's Day Parade in neighboring <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION>. The march, which annually attracts more than 225,000 people, `` is regarded as being most conducive to the thoughtful discussion and consideration of driving snakes from places,'' they said. The last known fatality from a snake bite in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> occurred outside <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> in 1761 when <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mireck </PERSON> was struck by a rattlesnake. The song `` On <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>,'' considered one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first folk tunes, commemorates <PERSON> Mireck </PERSON>'s encounter with the `` pesky sarpent.''

 A coffee dispute is brewing at City Hall. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacoby </PERSON>, an aide to Mayor <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON>, says he's steaming over a decision by City Controller <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> to challenge a $ 177.60 bill submitted for coffee supplied to the mayor's office `` The vast majority of the coffee consumed in the mayor's suite is by visitors. We have very little hospitality to offer other than a cup of coffee,'' he said. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a contracts supervisor for <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, recently wrote a memo to the mayor challenging the bill and claiming the mayor failed to follow proper procedures for procuring the percolating perk. He said a contract must be awarded for a coffee service. `` The more important question is how can you justify using tax dollars to purchase coffee for your office?'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON> are among several Democrats running for mayor.

 The city is spending $ 125,000 to install a toilet for a bridge tender staffing the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION>, and the issue is creating a stink among neighbors who say the hang-down plumbing is an eyesore. A water-supply pipe has already been installed, at a cost of $ 40,000, for the north tower toilet on the drawbridge. But work on the sewer pipe has been stopped for the present in response to complaints from neighbors and the city Engineering Department's own surprise at how ugly the 4-inch cast-iron sewer line looks hanging from rods under the bridge, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodoia </PERSON>, project engineer. Critics have suggested a pump system, which would allow the plumbing to be hidden under the bridge deck. <PERSON> Bodoia </PERSON> said that would be more expensive, as would a holding tank arrangement that was considered by the city. However, <PERSON> Bodoia </PERSON> said that with the complaints, a decision still has to be made on whether to go ahead with the unsightly installation or an alternative. Why not just have the bridge tender walk to the south tower toilet when nature calls? That would require a walk of about a block each way, and the Engineering Department's <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> frowns on the operator leaving the tower, in case boat traffic approaches.

 What do you feed a hungry cosmonaut? The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> suggests the fare aboard the Mir space station is so out-of-this-world that it would bring water to the mouths of earthbound gourmets. `` Some dishes are so exquisite that lovers of gourmet food on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> would be glad to have them,'' the news agency said Thursday. `` These include chicken paste with plums, sturgeon with jellied sauce, processed fruit and all kinds of juices.'' For the anniversary of the Soviet army and navy Thursday, cosmonauts <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Krikalev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> dined on pickled cucumbers, lemons, fresh fruit and Russian bee honey, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said such delicacies are part of a space diet that includes about 70 dishes, including meat, fish and dairy products. Some Soviet spacemen spend months in orbit. Alas, cosmonauts must forgo the bubbly, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>: `` Cosmonauts are not allowed to have alcholic drinks even on the most solemn occasions.''

<TEXT>
 While the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments consider the fate of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, doctors say his exile here may soon end without a struggle _ in death. Sunday is the third anniversary of the deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president's arrival in exile, and he will probably mark the occasion from his hospital bed, where he has spent most of 1989. Doctors say he appears tired and defeated. `` It's very hard to describe why a patient is so lethargic, why they do n't move around in bed or try to stand,'' said Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Druger </PERSON>, a lung specialist who has treated the 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for the past six weeks at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's almost as though he's lost his will to live. He's trying, but he's not fighting like he used to,'' <PERSON> Druger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Druger </PERSON>, one of a team of doctors treating the former president, said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has only a 50 percent chance of ever leaving the hospital and a 10 percent chance of living another year. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ill health has prevented him from being arraigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on federal racketeering charges. He and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, are accused of stealing more than $ 100 million from their homeland and stashing it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After their indictment Oct. 21, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to plead innocent and was freed on $ 5 million bail. Although the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> stole billions of dollars during his 20-year rule, it has never charged him with fraud. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> is scheduled to resume a hearing March 6 on whether <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is well enough to be arraigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. His attorneys argue <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> should be granted a `` medical severance,'' meaning prosecution against him would not proceed unless he recovers. Prosecutors have said it is too early to determine <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' long-term prognosis. Aides said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' spirits were buoyed Thursday by a visit from Cardinal <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>, the archbishop of the central Philippine city of <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, who performed Mass at <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' bedside and gave Communion to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife. `` This is a pastoral and spiritual visit to a very sick man,'' <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> said. `` It is the only reason I came to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. I'm not acting as an emissary.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> remains in guarded condition in the hospital's intensive care unit. <PERSON> Druger </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> improved slightly in the past week, relying on a respirator only while sleeping and speaking clearly for the first time in three weeks. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on Feb. 26, 1986, after being ousted in a popular uprising, has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 for treatment of pneumonia and bronchial asthma. Earlier, he was hospitalized with congestive heart failure; he also suffers from kidney problems. A few weeks ago <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aides said it was the leader's dying wish that he be allowed to return to his homeland. Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has banned his return, saying it would threaten national security. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has visited her husband daily during his hospital stay while maintaining her whirlwind social life. The 59-year-old former beauty queen is often sighted at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>'s most expensive restaurants and popular nightclubs. While her husband lies in the hospital, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' outings are tracked by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and reported in local gossip columns. `` Sometimes she sees the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> guys sitting at the other end of the restaurant and she invites them over,'' said <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON>, a family spokesman. `` Some things -LRB- in the news media -RRB- hurt her feelings, but the general public is nice to her, people even ask for her autograph. She says their friendliness helps restore her faith in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And she still has hope that she and the president will be cleared.''

 Thirteen <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> paintings, tucked away in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> corporate office for 20 years, were returned to the steel company that commissioned them thanks to an out-of-court settlement with its estranged chairman. The 23-by-30-inch paintings, commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and produced by the renowned artist in 1966, were recently returned to the steelmaker by the company's now powerless chairman, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> executives and guests, including three retired steelworkers who modeled for <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>, paid $ 50 a ticket for charity Thursday night at a black-tie viewing of the oil paintings, which depict workers involved in various steelmaking operations. `` It looks better each time I look at it,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Petropulos </PERSON>, a 29-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> who posed for one of the paintings. He said another steelworker was originally chosen to be a subject for the painting. `` But Mrs. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> saw me at the company and thought I was more mature for the picture than the other person,'' Petropulos recalled. After taking control of the steelmaker in 1969, <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> ordered the paintings moved to his corporate offices in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, had to file suit against <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> last July after he first refused to return the paintings <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> agreed to relinquish the paintings in an out-of-court settlement. `` You never know, we may be forced to sell them in the future by events beyond our control,'' said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> `` Bill'' <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, who was recently appointed by bankruptcy court to oversee the company's reorganization `` But I hope they stay in the community for a long time to come.'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Illustration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he had viewed copies of the paintings in a <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> catalogue and believed each was worth $ 20,000. A mystery of sorts surrounds one painting. The company commissioned 14 paintings, but only 13 were shipped to <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s offices 20 years ago The one painting has never been found. That irks <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichert </PERSON>, who posed for the missing painting. `` How can somebody walk in an office and take it away without anyone knowing,'' <PERSON> Reichert </PERSON> said. `` Somebody knows where it is.'' Company executives said they are at a loss as to where the painting may be. `` The painting could have been given to one of our customers. But who knows,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieckman </PERSON>, chief operating officer for <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that when the paintings were first completed they were n't considered exceptionally valuable. `` It was considered part of our advertising program at the time,'' <PERSON> Sieckman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> worked with his third wife, <PERSON> Molly </PERSON>, over a four-day period in photographing the men who were subjects in the 14 paintings. He later put the images to canvas at his studio in <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` He made you so at ease so quickly,'' recalls <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Addicott </PERSON>, a 43-year veteran of <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was a quiet man but he had a sense of humor.''

<TEXT>
 A blast of arctic air whisked through parts of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, threatening crops, closing schools and creating treacherous travel conditions on roadways where scores of accidents occurred. Two weather-related deaths were reported. Snow fell in some areas where people had n't seen it for years, as the gelid conditions descended as far south as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> today. A 34-degree reading at <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> was lower than the reading at <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, which had a temperature of 37 degrees. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, flood-stricken <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> was declared a major disaster area by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today, making federal aid available to affected people and local governments. The region was hit by heavy rains and flooding beginning on Feb. 13. And in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, many residents forced from their houses by the rain-swollen <LOCATION> Obion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> contended with freezing temperatures and icy backwater as they await a chance to start cleaning up the mess left by the flooding. `` If it gets much colder, I'll be able to pick the backwater up in my truck and haul it away,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON>, a resident of the small town of <LOCATION> Obion </LOCATION>. Brisk northwest winds accompanied the cold temperatures, producing wind chill readings in the single digits in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> this morning. A man who would have celebrated his 85th birthday today was found dead of hypothermia in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, on Thursday, police spokesman <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON> said. Because the heaters in the man's house were off, his death was ruled weather-related, <PERSON> Gantt </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a 72-year-old man died Thursday when his pickup truck fell off an icy bridge on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 29 bypass near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and plunged into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oconee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, police said. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s agriculture commissioner, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>, said freezing weather threatened wheat, peach and onion crops. `` I think we're in for some hard times,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Toombs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> extension service director. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, peach growers also braced for the worst. `` Probably the majority of them right now feel like with as low as it's predicted to go, there's not a whole lot they can do,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, extension agent coordinator for <LOCATION> Chilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where most of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s peach crop is grown. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said some peach growers were planning to burn coal or tires to ward off the effects of the bitter cold. An 88-year-old record was set in Mobile early today when the temperature dropped to 24. The previous record for this date was 28 degrees set in 1901. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, snow accumulations ranged up to 7 inches, and flurries were seen as far south as <LOCATION> Valdosta </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a police desk clerk in <LOCATION> Valdosta </LOCATION>, said the last snowfall police could recall in the area was six years ago. `` The kids were very excited because they're not used to this,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> was closed today as were school systems through the northern half of the state. Snow began falling in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> late Thursday, the first seen in three years, police said. It forced closing of the Talmadge Memorial Bridge over the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and caused a number of accidents. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> emergency management officials said several major roadways were closed Thursday because of slick conditions, including sections of Interstate 59 in <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and Interstate 20 east of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. All roads had reopened by the afternoon. The combination of increasing snowfall and high winds made driving very hazardous throughout <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` It's bad,'' said Officer <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alleghany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` All the roads are covered, we've got ice, and people are wrecking right and left.'' A pair of firefighters and their two children were seriously injured Thursday evening while trying to help two other motorists trapped in an overturned car off Interstate 240. A tractor-trailer jackknifed and struck two parked pickups carrying a boy and girl, and the two firefighters who were standing along the road. Among the other accidents were a 15-car pileup in <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> on Thursday morning. And in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, at least 100 accidents were reported within the city limits, authorities said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Mexican authorities riding horses, all-terrain vehicles and helicopters rounded up about 500 suspected illegal aliens and drug traffickers in raids on both sides of the border, news reports said. About 50 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents swept down to the north bank of the <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'s concrete-lined channel, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying, and took about 350 suspected undocumented aliens into custody. Meanwhile, officers from city, state and federal police departments in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> waited south of the border as hundreds of people fled up the south bank and through holes in the chainlink border fence, the paper said Thursday. Mexican police arrested about 150 suspected alien smugglers and drug dealers, the paper quoted Capt. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tijuana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as saying. Authorities carried out the raids near the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ysidro </LOCATION> crossing about six miles west of the proposed site of a border ditch that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say would help stop illegal border crossings. The plan has fueled controversy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, offended many Mexicans, and aggravated border relations. News reports described Thursday's raids as one of the largest such operations in recent years. The Mexico-City based Excelcior news service said the raid lasted 45 minutes. `` There is a lot of bandit activity and drug dealing down on the levee itself,'' the paper quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> as saying. `` Once in a while, we gather our strength and run a sweep. A temporary shortage of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents has led increasing numbers of migrants to cross at the river channel, according to <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officials. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities found no drugs or weapons, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wernsing </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> station. `` We suspect when they realized they were going to be caught, they threw whatever they had on the ground,'' he was quoted by the paper as saying. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said Thursday that most of the 350 suspects would be processed as undocumented aliens and released in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> overnight. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said many of the 150 suspects arrested in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> were held by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> for questioning on drug charges, the newspaper said.

 Authorities found in an abandoned house 85 tons of explosives that subversives intended to use for more terrorist bombings, a military commander said. Four bombs have gone off in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in less than a week. The explosives were found by police and soldiers Thursday in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, where the latest bombing occurred, in an abandoned house near <LOCATION> Hector </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caraccioli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, said Col. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, chief of the 4th Infantry Batallion. `` These materials were to be used by subversive groups to continue the chain of terrorist acts that lately have unleashed panic in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' he said. The cache included dynamite, detonators, liquid explosives, and other explosives used in the construction industry, said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>. No suspects were detained. Before dawn on Thursday, the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, were attacked in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, which is about 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, a bomb ripped through City Hall in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, injuring 10 people. Another bomb exploded Monday in a building housing offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in the capital. No injuries were reported. On Saturday, a crude bomb thrown at the back of a bus carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> injured three soldiers and two Honduran civilians. No one has claimed responsibility for any of the attacks. Honduran leftists have protested the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers conducting maneuvers with the Honduran military.

 Civil rights pioneer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> is unfazed by the election of a former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and said he even agrees with him on numerous issues. `` There's nothing wrong with his English,'' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> said of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. `` I understand what he's saying and a lot of it is the same thing I've been saying.'' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, 55, a self-described conservative who was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Thursday to speak about a federal order to desegregate <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s colleges, said he found <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> more believable than many other politicians. `` People say ` he used to be a Klan leader' and he used to be this or that, well, I'm a Christian and I believe people can change,'' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, who had to be escorted into the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals in 1962 and who still bears the scars of three shotgun blasts from an assassination attempt in 1966, said before his speech that he and <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> agree on many things. `` We agree on equal opportunity.

Judiciary, I'm concerned about our courts and law enforcement.'' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is a Republican, echoed the former Klan grand wizard in other areas. `` I'm against abortion. I'm against handing out diplomas to black Americans who have not been taught what those diplomas represent,'' he said. `` I do n't believe in paying welfare to able-bodied men and women. `` I think those things are wrong and bad for us as a people. They are the way the liberal establishment keeps power over people.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is posing the $ 25,000 Question, offering a prize in that amount to anyone who can figure out the best way to convert the ruble into dollars, the top Soviet economist says. A warning, though, to would-be entrants: Some Western economists think the question may be unanswerable. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON>, chief economic adviser to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, mentioned the $ 25,000 prize Thursday in a speech to a group of international bankers and businessmen. <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> said the Soviets are planning the contest jointly with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Esalen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, once better known for its encounter sessions and other experiments in radical psychology. The Soviets have increasingly discussed the possibility of making the ruble `` convertible'' so that it can be traded on world markets. Because their currency can not be traded for Western currency, it has no intrinsic value on other markets. That severely limits the Soviets' ability to buy foreign goods. In his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> spoke of the possibilities of converting the ruble to hard currency over the next seven to 10 years or the creation of free trade zones in the country with a second currency that would be semiconvertible. `` This semiconvertible currency would be backed by gold and export goods,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is aware that the official rate of the ruble is `` not realistic'' at $ 1.60, he said, adding that it might eventually be devalued to half that amount. Black market rates for rubles in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are 25 cents to 30 cents. In the meantime, he said, `` we plan to double internal prices for raw materials and fuels ... to bring them closer to world prices.'' Some Western economists scoff at the notion of the Soviets making the ruble convertible, saying such a move would require a wholesale transformation of the nation's economy. Asked about the idea last December, <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabijaka </PERSON>, an economist on the Soviet desk at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` You probably believe in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, too.'' In another speech in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aganbegyan </PERSON> told 200 executives of high-tech companies that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants to encourage joint ventures with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms to commercialize Soviet technology. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently abolished requirements that joint ventures with companies from other countries had to be at least 51 percent Soviet-controlled. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> market research firm that sponsored the speech to high-tech leaders, said the relaxation of restrictions on joint ventures was welcomed in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` There may be real prospects for technology deals,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` But it's still a long march to develop any kind of a market there. These deals are hard to put together.''

 Heavyweight champ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> says he credits his sense of humor, picked up on the streets of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, for helping him through a year of seemingly unceasing media scrutiny of his private life. `` That <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> sense of humor _ that's like no other place in the world,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said in an interview in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I took all that stuff as serious as it appeared, man, I really would be manic.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, who will defend his title against <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> Saturday, says he occasionally visits his old <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> neighborhood, `` but since crack nothing's the same, nothing good's happening, my old friends are gone or dead or worse `` I see these guys on crack, like zombies, no will, no spirit.

<TEXT>
 Algerian voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that paves the way for a multi-party system for the first time since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1962. More than 70 percent of the 10.4 million voters in Thursday's balloting voted for the constitutional change, according to results announced today by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> The constitution extends the process of political and social reform that President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> promised after a week of riots last October left 176 people dead by official count. Government offices were the main targets of rioters. About 80 percent of the 13 million voters in this former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> colony in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> cast ballots, the ministry said. Interior Minister <PERSON> Aboubakr </PERSON> <PERSON> Belkaid </PERSON> said the new constitution `` opens the way to a new era.'' He said it will allow his country `` to know more democracy, to assure public and individual liberties, and to establish the sovereignty of the law.'' Although it does not specifically authorize political parties to compete with the ruling <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in this nation of 25 million, the new constitution declares `` the right to create associations of a political character.'' Since Bendjedid, 59, announced the draft constitution, various groups have begun forming. Among them are the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the Berber's <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> and Democracy. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahsas </PERSON>, a former agricultural minister, announced formation of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, the official <ORGANIZATION> Algerian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the third national referendum in less than four months. In November, 92 percent of the voters approved political reforms that began reducing the power of the ruling party, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s only legal political organization. The next month, about 81 percent elected Bendjedid to a third five-year term. October's riots were rooted in economic problems brought by low world prices for oil, the nation's chief export. Many Algerians blamed the centralized, socialist government for failing to solve the problems. The proposed constitution also guarantees freedom of expression and, within limits, the right to strike. It would restrict the army to defending the `` national independence, the unity and territorial integrity of the country.'' Under the current charter, the army has a role in `` development of the country and the building of socialism.'' Also dropped is a declaration that `` the Algerian state is socialist.'' The new text does not refer to socialism. However, Islam would remain the state religion and Arabic the official language.

<TEXT>
 A suitcase filled with dummy weapons used to train security personnel triggered a real-life emergency drill at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> as a jumbo jet was ordered off a runway and a busy terminal was evacuated. `` It looked like a normal suitcase,'' airport spokeswoman <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said Thursday. `` There were two imitation hand grenades and a fake firearm, like a pistol. There was also a fake explosive device complete with a detonator and tubes.'' The suitcase, a demonstration kit belonging to a London-based security manager for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, originally cleared customs in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and was supposed to be loaded onto <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 445 to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Airport security spotted the bag after it was left behind by mistake, and immediately called the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A-300 off the runway for a security check, delaying the flight by an hour, Ms. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. They also closed the airport's international flight terminal for about 30 minutes, causing minor flight delays but no cancellations, said Ms. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. `` Normally, we would hear from airline somehow,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. `` We were not notified of this ... and, of course, when you see that in our security screening system, it looks like the real thing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> security office was supposed to send a message to the airlines' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office and to security personnel at the airport warning them of the kit, Ms. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. `` We believe it was sent, but somehow it was not received,'' she said. `` It's one of those miscommunications that are unfortunate.'' Security seminars held throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> system have used the fake weapons kits for some time, Ms. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. She said the anti-terrorism classes were routine long before a bomb exploded on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s Flight 103 from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last December, killing all 259 people aboard in a crash in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tony Lo Bianco Stars as ``Hizzoner!'' on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs of other reviews; no PMs planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite the exclamation point, there's not much to cheer in `` Hizzoner!'' _ a one-man show based on the life of <PERSON> Fiorello </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaGuardia </PERSON>. The play, which opened Thursday at Broadway's Longacre Theater, seems like a textbook recitation about one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s most famous and colorful mayors. Little of that color comes through in playwright <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shyre </PERSON>'s theatrical biography which smacks of extensive research but little imagination. <PERSON> Shyre </PERSON> sets his play in 1945 on the mayor's last day in office. While <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> is cleaning out his desk, he also dusts off his memories, giving the audience a dry, rather straightforward accounting of his life. Shyre makes it sound like a resume. There are no surprises and very little insight into the man who not only was mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for 12 years but also a congressman, a clerk in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign service, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pilot and a tireless champion of the underdog. Whatever heart the evening has comes from the hard work of actor <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> who invests the play with an energy that rarely flags. <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> has to work doubly hard, too. During a preview last week, he broke an ankle sliding down a fire pole. He continued with the performance but now wears a black foot cast. The cast has n't hampered the actor's movement around designer <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON>'s credible recreation of the mayor's City Hall office. In fact, it adds to the performance, giving <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> a jaunty gait as he makes his way back and forth across the stage. The actor's physical resemblance to <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> is amazing. His bulldog frame suggests the great man's height and weight, and he has down pat that peculiar way the mayor scrunched up his face when he got excited. For the most part, he also captures <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>'s voice, a high-pitched, almost squeaky way of talking. <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> is at his best in several of the imaginary press conferences he holds with newspaper reporters. The mayor's banter does n't stop and neither does <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> in his efforts to get the last bit of humor out of each joke. Famous names _ <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gypsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> _ are dropped into the evening at regular intervals, but their associations with <ORGANIZATION> LaGuardia </ORGANIZATION> are not as interesting as the mayor's personal revelations about the death of his first wife and child, his father's <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> career or occasional thoughts about being mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The best moment in the play occurs near the end when <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> muses on the price of progress. He worries about the homeless men bulldozed into oblivion when their shacks near the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> are torn down to start construction of the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkway </PERSON>. Was the project worth the human cost? But that introspection is rare in `` Hizzoner!'' The play is more concerned with events, presented in the most prosaic way possible. <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>'s various political campaigns _ successful and unsuccessful _ are related in often confusing detail and eventually blur together. Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Going </PERSON> has n't found a way to separate them on stage. Other famous moments are glossed over. When <ORGANIZATION> LaGuardia </ORGANIZATION> reads the comics over the radio during a newspaper strike, it falls flat. The incident is well-known, but seems an afterthought to the meandering second act which repeats many of the devices _ press conferences, radio programs _ used in Act 1. <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>'s life certainly had enough drama for a theater piece. The creators of `` Fiorello!'' captured it 30 years ago in the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical. `` Hizzoner!'' has n't. It has put the biographical facts but not the man himself on stage. In other reviews: The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> says <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> `` cuts an engaging and persuasive figure as <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>.'' But, he says, the play's `` basic trouble is that its sole character appears to be running for office as much as appearing in a play.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> wrote that: `` ` Hizzoner!' has the faults of most one-person shows based on famous people. It quickly becomes a history lesson.'' <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> says <PERSON> Lo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bianco </PERSON> `` gives <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> a vulgarity, a buffoonishness that diminishes the Little Flower unfairly.'' In The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gussow </PERSON> wrote that the <ORGANIZATION> LaGuardia </ORGANIZATION> presented in the play, `` would win few votes either as a candidate or as a comedian.''

 Protesters denouncing Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as `` mankind's biggest war criminal'' burned <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> flags in two cities today and riot police blocked demonstrators from marching on the Japanese Embassy. Riot police with shields dispersed about 70 protesters who tried to march to the embassy after 200 people held an anti-Japanese rally in a park and burned a flag to denounce Japanese war crimes. Police took 10 marchers into custody. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must apologize!'' and `` Let's drive out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese influence!'' protesters shouted. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>, about 60 protesters burned a Japanese flag near the Japanese consulate and demanded <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> apologize for war atrocities, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. Protesters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> tried to march to the Japanese Embassy to demand an apology for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s harsh treatment of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under the colonial rule of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose funeral was held today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> occupied <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from 1910 to 1945. `` <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was mankind's biggest war criminal and our national foe,'' said a statement by protesters. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has never made a formal apology to the Koreans for their wrongdoings.'' <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Il-kwan </PERSON>, one of the backers of the nation's largest dissident alliance, was among those detained by police in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Protesters in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> also shouted anti-American slogans and denounced the scheduled visit Monday of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Radicals have called for protests Saturday and Monday to protest the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trip. Police said a security alert was in effect from noon today until midnight Monday to block any protests against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

Radical students and dissidents have said weekend protestes will also be aimed at the government of South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo, which celebrates its first anniversary Saturday. Radicals claim the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government is a military dictatorship propped up by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and demand the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the country under a mutual defense treaty be removed.

 A 23-year-old man serving as a juror in a drug-related murder trial was arrested on charges he tried to enter the downtown courthouse carrying a hidden bag of cocaine. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> was arrested upon his return from a lunch break when a metal detector went off and authorities found a zippered pouch containing the drugs inside his coat. `` It just goes to show you that it is possible to get a jury of your peers,'' a court official said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was charged with possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, authorities said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was a juror in the first-degree murder trial of <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derbigney </PERSON>, who is accused of killing a 66-year-old man during what prosecutors described as a narcotics dispute last September. According to <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Santivasci </PERSON>, a deputy chief in the sheriff's office, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> returned to the courthouse carrying a bag from a fast-food restaurant and when he entered the <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON> Courthouse, a metal detector alarm sounded. A deputy told <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> to empty his pockets and sent him back through the detector, but the alarm went off again. The deputy used a hand-held scanner to check <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and found a brown leather pouch stashed in his inside coat pocket, allegedly containing cocaine with a street value of about $ 750, police said. Apparently, the pouch's metal zipper and two cigarette lighters activated the metal detector, authorities said. `` He made no statement. All I said to him was: ` Is this coke?' And he said, ` Yeah,''' said <PERSON> Santivasci </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was dismissed from the jury, and Judge <PERSON> Elsbeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bothe </PERSON>, who is presiding over the trial, told him not to discuss the case with anyone at the jail. It was the second time in three months that drugs were confiscated from someone entering the courthouse. On Nov. 21, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Kesler </PERSON>, 19, was charged with possession of heroin and possession of heroin with intent to distribute.

<TEXT>
 Fighting between guerrillas and Vietnamese forces in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is escalating as the two sides try to bolster their positions prior to a political settlement, a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> military spokesman said today. The two sides have `` renewed battles to extend areas of influence, particularly in anticipation of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and cessation of all aid to warring parties,'' said the spokesman, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Naruedol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dejpradiyuth </PERSON>. `` The combatants are competing for territory, seeking ways to maximize their advantage before a political settlement is reached,'' he said at a monthly news conference. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ended nearly four years of rule by the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> during which an estimated 2 million of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s 8 million people died from <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> executions, famine and civil unrest. Vietnamese forces and troops of the Vietnamese-installed government are now opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and two other less powerful guerrilla groups, all three of which receive sanctuary in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Naruedol </PERSON> said the fighting escalated during the peace talks that ended Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The talks ended without any new agreements, but the issue goes to other forums in the coming months and all sides say the momentum is toward a negotiated settlement. <PERSON> Naruedol </PERSON> noted the summit in May between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which arms <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which arms the guerrillas. The Vietnamese have pledged to withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> next year. Renewed clashes during the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> talks have been reported between the Vietnamese and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malai </LOCATION> area on the central sector of the Thai-Cambodian border.

<TEXT>
 A Broadway producer-investor was ready to flee the country when she was arrested for stealing more than $ 1 million by telling investors she was the `` secret wife'' of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, a prosecutor said. <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, an investor in the Broadway shows `` Hair,'' `` <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON>,'' and `` The Ritz,'' was indicted Thursday, and she remains in jail without bail on a charge of first-degree grand larceny in connection with the alleged scheme, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said. He said Ms. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> conducted the scheme between April 1988 until her arrest last week and was about to flee the country when she was picked up by authorities outside her <LOCATION> mid-Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment building. She is scheduled to be arraigned March 8. <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> convinced investors to give her money by telling them she was secretly married to <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, retired chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He said she promised investors that <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> would invest their money and obtain profits of 48 percent to 82 percent within 90 days. <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> displayed two fake marriage certificates which showed she had married <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Prosecutors alleged that Ms. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> victimized one investor, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> investment counselor, of $ 1 million, and other investors of smaller amounts. The six-count indictment lists five people allegedly swindled by Ms. <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> said his office knew of at least 26 people from whom she had obtained money ostensibly for investment. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>'s attorney, said: `` The true facts are not as they appear in the indictment. At a trial, the truth will emerge and my client will be vindicated.'' The first-degree grand larceny charge carries a maximum term of 25 years in prison upon conviction.

<HEAD>Bookstore Chain Proclaims Position on `The Satanic Verses'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A bookstore chain that initially withdrew `` The Satanic Verses'' from its shelves for fear of terrorist attack went on the offensive today, saying it will continue to sell the book despite `` many threats of violence.'' Waldenbooks, one of the nation's largest chains, ran advertisements in nine newspapers defending its decision to stop displaying the book, which has been condemned by Moslems worldwide. `` We will continue to sell the book when it comes back in stock at the publisher,'' declared the ads, signed by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the chain. `` We will continue to use discretion in displaying the book.'' The advertisement is headlined `` A Statement of Fact in Troubled Times.'' Two other large book chains, <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Barnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, briefly stopped selling ` The Satanic Verses'' after <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader, called for the execution of its author, British novelist <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, and those responsible for its publication. Those stores resumed sales of the book Wednesday after nationwide protests. Waldenbooks ordered the book removed from store shelves last Friday, but said its managers could sell it from behind the counter. Today's advertisement cited `` the many threats of violence made against our stores and our people.'' A Waldenbooks spokeswoman, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urdan </PERSON>, said the chain received an estimated 60 bomb threats in the first days after the death threat was issued. All three of the large chains were criticized by writers' groups for engaging in a form of censorship, but <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> insisted that his employees' safety was the real issue. In any case, Ms. <PERSON> Urdan </PERSON> said, `` The question is moot for the time being because there are no more books in stock and there wo n't be until March 10.'' Viking Penguin, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publisher of `` The Satanic Verses,'' is reportedly printing 15,000 copies and has plans for another 50,000 within two weeks, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The Times said an unidentified book wholesaler predicted the book would sell 500,000 copies in hardcover, making it a huge best-seller. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, speakers at a rally Thursday urged people to buy the book to register support for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. `` Let's not be stampeded by this kind of intellectual terrorism. Let's vote with our wallets. Buy -LRB- <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s -RRB- book,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, winner of the 1987 National Book Award for his novel `` <PERSON> Paco </PERSON>'s Story.'' Speaking to more than 300 fellow writers and supporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, celebrated <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> gossip columnist <PERSON> Irv </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupcinet </PERSON> said, `` If good people do n't stand up and act ... evil takes over. A small group of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Moslems attended the rally, handing out brochures condemning <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book for insulting Islam in a manner that `` scandalizes and maligns'' Muslims' beliefs. `` We do n't agree with the death threat or the bounty,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiseruddin </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` But we are still very offended by passages in ` The Satanic Verses' that use profanity to describe the prophets <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>.''

 <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said he acted in the interests of national security when he partially lifted a ban on the shipments of nuclear waste into the state. But anti-nuclear activists said the issue is not national security, but a burgeoning radioactive waste supply with no place to go. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> announced Thursday that he will allow temporary shipments of transuranic and low-level radioactive waste into the state. The shipments are to come only from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> nuclear weapons plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, and only for the next six months The governor said two railroad boxcars per month will be accepted from the Rocky Flats site near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to avoid a `` serious national security crisis'' if the facility closed down. An average of four boxcars per month were shipped from the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> plant to the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> closed <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s borders to waste shipments last Oct. 19.

<HEAD>Owner Of Seabrook Doubts Plant Will Operate For Two Years</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant wo n't operate commercially for another two years, if at all, one owner told the lead owner's bankruptcy judge `` I think it is more likely than not that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> will run. But it is still a very uncertain situation. It changes on a daily basis,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president. Testifying at a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy hearing Thursday, <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ which would spin off that utility's <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> investment into a separate company _ assumes <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> will operate by mid-1991. Other Northeast and <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials stressed that the company's estimate of May 1991 is for financial-planning purposes and may be conservative. It is 16 months later than the estimate used by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 5.8 billion plant, finished in 1986, remains idle for lack of a federal operating license. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> management division, played down the Northeast projection. He said financial-planning estimates, used in dealings with utility regulators and lenders, are by their nature `` very conservative.'' `` It appears to us that the licensing process will be completed by the end of the year,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Commercial operation should follow soon afterward, he added. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said he was concerned that differences in owners' financial-planning estimates on <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> may be perceived as meaning that `` <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has slipped again.'' `` That is really not accurate,'' <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said. `` Some -LRB- owners -RRB- are more conservative than others,'' <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it will make a new offer to state officials next month on electricity rate increases it seeks to emerge from bankruptcy protection. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayless </PERSON>, made the disclosure Thursday as he tried to show a federal bankruptcy judge that there still are prospects for a reorganization settlement that would avert lengthy, expensive litigation. The state, the utility and its creditors have been locked in dispute over a key issue in the reorganization _ what rates <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will be able to charge for its 36 percent share of the completed but stalled <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> plant. The company also announced it had settled a securities-fraud lawsuit brought by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that helped pay for completing the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. Northeast, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s largest power company, wants to buy <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s non-Seabrook assets, and has made a bid that it says is worth about $ 2 billion if <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> operates. Northeast is stressing its experience with nuclear plants, having built the three-reactor Millstone project in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> was project manager for Millstone 3, which he said began commercial operation about two weeks ahead of schedule in April 1986.

 Although careful to separate religion and the modern democratic state, organizers of today's grand funeral for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> drew deeply from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Shinto rites and ancient traditions. Court music was played, classical poetry read and costumes of another era worn although government officials said the funeral ceremony was pared down in length and pomp to `` conform to the times.'' The funeral lasted more than 13 hours; the 1927 funeral of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s father, <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION>, took a day and a half and mourners dared not even look at the hearse bearing <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION>'s body. Japanese today snapped photographs of the funeral procession, and <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s son Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> carried his own umbrella. He delivered a eulogy in common speech, rather than the elaborate courtly language used for such events in the past. But the main funeral ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Shinjuku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION>, led by the new emperor, was still steeped in the rituals of Shinto, the indigenous religion which predates yet still co-exists with Buddhism. Sensitive to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar constitution, which insists on separation of religion and state and relegates the emperor to a figurehead role, the funeral organizers stressed such a duality in the ceremonies. An actual curtain of black color was drawn after the completion of the Shinto ceremony at the gardens and reopened before the start of the state funeral. The curtain separated some 9,800 invited mourners and the imperial family from the hall where <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s body lay. The sound of flutes and ancient court music heralded the start of the elaborate procession led by <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> into the funeral grounds. Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, in a flowing black dress and matching veil, followed a few steps behind. Dignitaries, representing 163 nations, were bundled up in dark, woolen blankets at their seats in a large tent. Once <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s coffin was in place in the funeral hall, specially constructed of Japanese cypress, ritualists made offerings, including silk and food, to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, marking the start of the Shinto ceremonies. Dressed in mourning black with a top hat and gloves clutched in his left hand, a solemn <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> entered the hall through the traditional Shinto ` torii' gate and bowed deeply. Stepping up to the altar, he read from a speech handed to him by a chamberlain and bid a final farewell to his father. After he left, Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> entered the hall, where she offered a sacred ` sakaki' branch to the late emperor. Ancient myths hold that gods dwell in the sakaki, or evergreen trees, which are often used in Shinto rituals as offerings to deities. Chamberlains later removed the offerings from the hall and the black curtain was drawn to signal the end of the 47-minute Shinto ceremony. By the start of the state funeral a short while later, the ` torii' gate and small tables at the altar had been removed. A speech by chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> signaled the beginning. Imperial family members again walked up to the funeral hall and bowed. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and other government representatives offered short eulogies. The one-hour state funeral concluded with the visiting foreign dignitaries stepping up to the hall and bowing to the late emperor and his family.

 Many Japanese bid an affectionate farewell today to the emperor who led them through a devastating war and into great prosperity. But for others, the funeral was an occasion to denounce the system he represented. `` <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is the greatest of war criminals during World War II with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>,'' said a 36-year-old high school teacher among about 400 demonstrators who gathered at one <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> park. Protesters from three leftist groups displayed banners denouncing the $ 74 million funeral and attacking <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> for his role as titular leader during <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s World War II aggression. `` Under the name of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, our mothers and fathers were mobilized for war in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and thousands of people were massacred,'' said the teacher, who refused to give his name. Opponents of the imperial system associate it with militarism and remind their countrymen that the emperor's name was used to rally support for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s invasion of much of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> during World War II. Until the end of the war, the emperor also stood at the head of the state Shinto religion, which was used to justify strong central control by the government and the suppression of human and religious rights. Civil servants at a municipal office in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s southwestern prefecture of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> voted to come to work today despite the government's designation of the day as a special national holiday in <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s honor. Resentment against <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> remains strong on the island, where about 210,000 Japanese civilians and soldiers died in the fiercest fighting on apanese territory of World War II. About 210,000 people lined the route taken by a funeral motorcade. Most appeared curious, braving a cold drizzle to crane their necks at the cortege, eagerly snapping pictures as the slow-moving hearse and its imperial motorcycle escort came into view. A few shed tears. But at 11 other locations in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, about 4,300 people took part in anti-emperor demonstrations, police said, including about 800 who shouted slogans through loudspeakers as they marched 2 -LCB- miles. Authorities arrested five people, including two who broke through police lines and ran into a street along the funeral route. National police said they had no figures on demonstrations elsewhere in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But in <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, about 30 people staged a sit-in in front of the Atomic Dome, the remnants of a domed building gutted by an atomic bomb in August 1945. Shortly after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped the bomb, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> announced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surrender. For some mourners in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> it proved an emotional sendoff as they lined up many rows deep and bowed their heads as <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s coffin passed by. <PERSON> Eitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohya </PERSON>, 77, recalled watching the 1927 funeral procession for <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s father. `` I remember keeping my head bowed so low because the emperor was considered a god that I saw nothing,'' <PERSON> Ohya </PERSON> recalled. `` But this time I watched. It is a great honor to witness two emperors' funerals. Others were bitter. <PERSON> Kazumasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyamoto </PERSON>, 70, said, `` I was forced to do construction work in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the name of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> and had a hard time. We should not spend money for such a funeral.'' The holiday kept department stores, restaurants, movie theaters and other places of entertainment shut down. Large sections of the city were blocked off to traffic and most residents stayed home or headed out of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Across the capital only a few small stores and restaurants remained open. In the <LOCATION> Nakano </LOCATION> district, where Marxists staged a protest, many of the demonstrators had lunch at the only eatery open: a <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> Fried Chicken outlet where the staff wore black mourning ribbons.

 Prosecutors played videotapes of jewelers counting money stacked to the ceiling as they argued against bail for gem store employees arrested in a $ 1 billion cocaine money-laundering network. Three of the defendants were ordered held without bail Thursday. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON> allowed $ 1.25 million bail for <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorfazian </PERSON> as well as $ 50,000 bail each for two gem store clerks. In arguing against bail for Mrs. <PERSON> Sorfazian </PERSON>, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> said the government `` does not have the resources'' to wipe out the sophisticated money-laundering network attacked Wednesday with arrests of dozens of people at the downtown jewelry district and other locations worldwide. `` If we let her out, are we letting her out to work for one of the jewelers we know are still doing this?'' he asked. Ms. <PERSON> Sorfazian </PERSON> has yet to post bail. Thirty-seven people were charged Wednesday with taking in at least $ 1 billion through merchants in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, then sending the laundered cash to Colombian drug lords. The defendants also were charged with aiding and abetting the distribution of 640 pounds of cocaine seized during the investigation. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> alleged the network may have been involved with importing as much as 44,000 pounds of the drug. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kronenberg </PERSON> agreed to postpone a bail hearing for two key figures in the case, <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Vahe </PERSON> <PERSON> Andonian </PERSON>, until Monday. The men had asked for time to hire lawyers. The <PERSON> Andonian </PERSON> brothers and <PERSON> Wanis </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyomejian </PERSON>, 47, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Ropex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, have been identified by authorities as leaders in the operation. <PERSON> Koyomejian </PERSON> and another alleged ring leader, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochman </PERSON>, were ordered held without bail. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> argued that Mrs. <PERSON> Sorfazian </PERSON> was responsible at <LOCATION> Ropex </LOCATION> for making almost daily wire transfers of cash to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Defense attorney <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> claimed her client was a secretary at <ORGANIZATION> Ropex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> who took home $ 215 a week. Mrs. <PERSON> Sorfazian </PERSON> thought she was working for a gold bullion exchange house that legitimately converted cash to gold, Ms. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. The prosecutor showed a surveillance videotape in which Mrs. <PERSON> Sorfazian </PERSON> and three other defendants were seen feeding money into two high-speed counting machines. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> said that at times during the government surveillance, the bills `` were literally stacked to the ceiling.'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zephur </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroyan </PERSON>, Lebanese-born sisters who worked as clerks for the Andonians, were granted $ 50,000 bail each. Other defendants in the case were ordered held without bail: <PERSON> Bedros </PERSON> <PERSON> Akpulat </PERSON>, 30, owner of Fancy Jewelry in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dalida </PERSON> <PERSON> Avakian </PERSON>, who is Mrs. <PERSON> Sorfazian </PERSON>'s sister; and <PERSON> Agop </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyomejian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wanis </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyomejian </PERSON>'s brother.

 The body of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> today was sealed inside a hillside crypt and offerings were made to his spirit, ending a 13-hour funeral attended by the largest gathering of world leaders in modern history. A day of elaborate ceremony concluded by torchlight shortly before 9 p.m. after the lace-draped coffin was put on a cart and tugged 33 feet up a slope by a pulley-like device. It was then moved inside a prepared stone tomb dug into the hillside and sealed with concrete. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s mound-like mausoleum is in a grove of towering cypress trees at the <ORGANIZATION> Musashi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetary </ORGANIZATION> west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Worshiped as a living god and branded a war criminal during his 87-year life, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was honored by official representatives of 163 nations at some of the ceremonies, including President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sat in the front row at the funeral, covered with wool and cashmere blankets to protect them from the winter chill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the collar of his black overcoat turned up, paused in front of the coffin and lowered his head in a slight bow when his turn came to approach the coffin. A bomb exploded in a roadside embankment about 20 minutes before a motorcade carrying <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s body and members of the imperial family passed by on its way to the burial ground. The motorcade was not delayed and no one was injured. Police said they suspected radicals planted the bomb. They said groups opposing the emperor system staged 11 demonstrations in the Japanese capital, and officers arrested five people. A 21-gun salute opened the final, five-hour-long ceremonies of entombment as the rainy weather that had occurred most of the day cleared. The ceremonies ended with the tombside offering of 16 kinds of food and six kinds of clothing. The imperial family, now led by 55-year-old Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, then returned to the Imperial Palace. The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said a sword, ceremonial shoes, books written by the emperor and favorite items of clothing were buried in the casket with <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said more than 100 personal belongings would be encased, including an old German-made microscope he used in marine biological research and a recent list of rankings of sumo wrestlers. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s favorite sport was sumo wrestling. `` The people will remember him forever,'' <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> said in his eulogy. He expressed his `` overwhelming emotion'' and `` extreme sense of sorrow'' while thanking the people of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and foreign countries who sent condolences after his father's death Jan. 7 from cancer. The $ 74 million funeral began with private Shinto rites within the walls of the palace in downtown <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The metropolis of 12 million came to a virtual standstill, and 32,000 police mounted the largest security operation in Japanese history to protect the world leaders and contain anti-monarchy protests. The day was declared a national holiday. Businesses were closed, and many residents took advantage of the long weekend to head for ski slopes. About 800 protestors burned a Japanese flag and chanted slogans through loudspeakers as they marched for 2 -LCB- miles from <LOCATION> Shiba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Another 400 demonstrators from three leftist groups gathered at another park, carrying banners denouncing the funeral and attacking <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> for his role as titular leader during <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s World War II aggression. `` The Tenno -LRB- Emperor -RRB- <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> is the greatest of war criminals during World War II with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON>,'' said a 36-year-old high school teacher, who refused to be identified. `` Under the name of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, our mothers and fathers were mobilized for war in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and thousands of people were massacred.'' But others cried or clasped their hands together in prayer as <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s coffin passed by. A 72-year-old farmer, <PERSON> Morie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiroki </PERSON>, tried to commit suicide by hari-kiri on the southern island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION>. The World War II army private left a note saying he felt he had to follow his emperor in death. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> renounced his purported divinity in 1946 as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> began its climb from the ashes of World War II toward spectacular economic success. Police estimated 571,400 people braved the 37-degree weather to view he funeral processions, including more than 200,000 who watched as a black hearse carrying the coffin drove slowly through central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> along a four-mile route from the Imperial Palace to the main ceremony at <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> Imperial Gardens. The motorcyle-escorted, 32-car procession passed <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the democratic core of modern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the National Stadium where the emperor opened the 1964 Summer Olympics, heralding <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar reemergence. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> led the imperial mourners, but <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s 85-year-old widow, the Empress <PERSON> Dowager </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON>, did not attend the public ceremonies due to reported poor health. At the <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> gardens, 51 black-robed men carried the coffin on a 22-foot-long palanquin to a wooden shrine for Shinto rites led by <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>. The body of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was encased in an inner wooden coffin and an outer one of metal. A chamberlain dressed in white followed the bier carrying a platter with a pair of white shoes that tradition says the deceased monarch will wear to heaven. Flutes and pipes, with an occasional drum beat, sounded a plaintive tune as the procession entered the ceremonial grounds. Members of the imperial family _ the women in veils, men in black tailcoats and black silk top hats _ protected themselves from the rain with umbrellas. In two vast, heated tents, were the 9,800 invited mourners: a phalanx of world leaders, Japanese government officials, private citizens and several champions of sumo wrestling. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> delivered his four-minute eulogy, a deep-voiced male chorus sang a solemn mourning song, a poem was read and imperial family members went individually before the coffin and bowed slowly. Shinto attendants wore black robes and traditional headgear, and eight men carried two sacred evergreen trees while others bore tall banners with imperial symbols of the sun and moon and chests containing ceremonial offerings. After the religious ceremony, Shinto appurtenances were removed and the state funeral began with a minute of silence. In his eulogy, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> described <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s 62-year reign as `` eventful and turbulent times for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, including the calamities of that deplorable war, the struggle to reconstruct itself from the ruins amid confusion and dire poverty and to regain its full independence.'' `` During all these years, Emperor <PERSON> Showa </PERSON> ardently wished for world peace and the well-being of the Japanese people,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> by his posthumous name. After the eulogies, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stepped to the front of the hall, paused and made a slight bow before the coffin. During World War II, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire. Also bowing before the coffin was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran of World War II who was at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surrender ceremony in 1945. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boycotted the funeral and some members of the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> stayed away from the Shinto ceremonies while attending the state ones.

 Bundled against the cold, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bowed in final respects to Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> at a rain-drenched funeral today and later vowed to fight on his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to salvage the troubled nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as secretary of defense. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined 9,800 mourners under tents at the <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> Imperial Garden ceremony, Tower's nomination was rejected in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The vote was 11-9, split along party lines with the Democrats in the majority. The vote _ the first such committee rejection of a president's Cabinet choice in 44 years _ was a major setback for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his first trip overseas as president, and came as he mingled with leaders of more than 160 countries `` I am going to strongly continue to back Sen. Tower, and I do n't believe he's going down the drain,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters after the funeral as he emerged from talks with foreign leaders at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence He said he had no intention of withdrawing Tower's name in favor of a new, less controversial nominee. `` I have n't considered any options,'' he said. `` I stand strongly with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>.'' Added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` He knows that when I get back, and I will be back before the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- vote, he knows I will do whatever I can to talk to individual members and have them know how strongly I feel about it, and hopefully to persuade some who have looked at evidence so far and may have a different opinion.'' Despite the setback, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he considers his honeymoon with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is `` still going fine.'' But inasmuch as he wants Tower confirmed, he said, `` I ca n't say it's a pat on the back.'' Although he appeared tired from the rigors of his journey, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he felt like `` a spring colt ready to charge.'' After paying a courtesy call on <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s son, Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, on Saturday morning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for two days of talks with Chinese leaders. He will visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> briefly on Monday en route home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Earlier, leaving the three-hour funeral, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had shown no sign of distress over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee's vote. He gave a thumbs-up sign and smiled as his armored limousine _ flown in specially from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ brought him back to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador's residence Apart from the funeral, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held separate meetings with Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, King <PERSON> Baudouin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, Italian President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a private dinner with King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assured Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support and noted that the administration is seeking $ 200 million in aid for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Recognizing that Tower's nomination suddenly was in deep trouble, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was up most of the night on long-distance telephone calls to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans and others, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> called Tower by telephone this afternoon to inform him of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s continued support. `` Sen. <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> said he knew it would be a difficult fight but he's ready to move forward,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. For the first time, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it `` would probably be helpful'' for the nomination to release the 140-page report on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of Tower's personal life. However, he said, `` I'm not at all sure that that can happen or that it should happen'' out of concern for those who were interviewed Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in a CBS television interview, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not been hurt by the Tower vote. `` I do n't think it's a loss until it goes down the tubes on the floor,'' he said, adding that he was not predicting that the nomination was lost Separately, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> interview that `` it is not in the best interest of the foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have a nomination hang fire for this long.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there was no consideration of any replacement for Tower, `` period, bar none.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had begun his day with calls to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., and other senators about Tower's But even before the committee voted, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had to put the matter aside to attend <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral. For the occasion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had rented a morning coat in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including gray stripe pants, black vest, black tie and black cutaway jacket with tails. Accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was given a front-row, center seat in one of two huge open-sided tents at the state funeral. To give him a place of prominence, Japanese officials had to waive protocol rules that would have put <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toward the back because of his short tenure in office. One by one, world leaders approached <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s coffin to pay respects after the formal eulogies. When their turn came, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife paused in front of the coffin and lowered their heads in a slight bow. A pelting rain and stiff wind made the chilly day in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> seem even colder. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wore a black overcoat and turned up his collar against the wind. Along with many other mourners, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife covered their laps with wool and cashmere blankets placed on each seat. There were electrical heating coils beneath the floor and a heater in the low wall directly in front of the president. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the last of the World War II-era world leaders, died of cancer at age 87 on Jan. 7 after reigning for six decades. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a statement thanking Japanese officials `` who managed this complicated logistics and put on a marvelous pageant in honor of the late emperor _ beautifully staged and beautifully carried off, on schedule, working against the elements, but nevertheless with a dignity and a ceremony that was appropriate.'' He said he had `` great respect for what they did and the way in which they did it, and I am proud to have represented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> here today.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> combat pilot in World War II who was shot down by Japanese gunners during a bombing run, said attending the funeral was the right thing to do because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are allies. The gesture was appreciated by the Japanese, particularly because of lingering resentment in some quarters about <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s role as a leader during the war. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> veterans were among those who objected to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was unaffected by the only significant security incident involving the emperor's funeral. A bomb damaged a highway along which the emperor's hearse was due to be taken after the ceremony, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was already back at his hotel at the time. Police speculated that radicals opposed to the emperor system were responsible for the blast.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed today to `` stand strongly'' with Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> through a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor vote despite the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of Tower's confirmation because of questions of character. `` I'm going to strongly continue to back Senator Tower and I do n't believe he's going down the drain,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where he was attending the funeral of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. The committee, voting strictly along party lines, recommended by 11-9 Thursday night that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reject Tower's nomination after Democrats expressed continuing concerns about questions of his character. `` I can not in good conscience vote to put an individual at the top of the chain of command when his history of excessive drinking is such that he would not be selected to command a missile wing, a SAC bomber squadron or a Trident missile submarine,'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the committee chairman, said before the vote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, faced with a political defeat at home as he made his global debut at the <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> funeral, said he believed lingering doubts about Tower would be answered when the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> takes up the nomination. `` I am going to strongly continue to back Senator Tower,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he left the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` ... I am hoping that this debate that will follow next week will clear up any questions.'' `` I have n't considered any options. I stand strongly with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said it would be a mistake for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to withdraw the nomination in advance of a vote on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` If he now pulled it I think all of you would say, ` this is a terrible thing. It shows that his judgment was flawed from the beginning','' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' The committee vote marked an abrupt departure from the month-long honeymoon between the new Republican president and the Democratic majorities of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still believes his relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` is still going fine.'' Should the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reject Tower, it would be the first time in history a newly elected president had suffered a rejection of a nominee to his first Cabinet. In all, eight Cabinet nominations have been rejected, the most recent 30 years ago. A handful of Democrats suggested after the committee vote Thursday night that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seek a replacement for Tower before next week's scheduled floor vote. `` It does n't do the president any good,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` It's a tremendous burden for any nominee to go to the floor with a vote of no confidence.'' But the White House quickly rejected that suggestion. `` There's no consideration of alternative candidates,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters traveling with the president in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` There's no alternate list _ bar none.'' `` He'll be working to contact senators throughout the days ahead, sometimes by telephone, sometimes in person,'' he said. Tower, a former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator who had once chaired the committee, said in a statement he was `` obviously disappointed'' but would continue to work at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` and await the vote of full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' The strictly partisan vote climaxed an extraordinary 2 -LCB- hour night-time committee session at which lawmakers swapped views on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation into numerous allegations against him. Tower has been dogged by allegations about his drinking habits and womanizing, as well as by questions of possible conflict of interest posed by his earning hundreds of thousands of dollars as a defense industry consultant after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The committee's senior Republican, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was entitled to a Cabinet of his own choosing. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> noted that many of the senators who had served with Tower had been questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> during its investigation. `` Not one single <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, not one who has served with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> can ever recall a single instance where any of his persoal habits interfered with his duty,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Not one.'' Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and a strictly party line vote on the floor would doom Tower's nomination. Still, the prospect is for a bruising struggle leading up to an expected vote next Wednesday or Thursday, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tries to sway enough Democratic votes to triumph in his first major confrontation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Even before the committee voted, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> made clear the importance of the issue for the president, saying on the floor that a vote against Tower would be a `` kick in the teeth'' to the president. One <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committee member, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, also said the party line vote would make it tougher to forge a bipartisan defense policy. In his leadoff speech to the committee, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> expressed concern about Tower's drinking, and said there were examples of behavior with women which he found indiscreet, although he added the record did not support allegations that the former senator exerted sexual pressure on women employees and associates. He said there was a `` significant public perception of a conflict of interest arising from -LRB- Tower's -RRB- receipt of large amounts of money from major contractors in return for the services he provided.'' Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> said Tower had undergone `` trial by leak,'' and said, `` repetition has become a standard of truth.'' The Democrats who voted for the motion to reject Tower were Sens. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The Republicans who voted against the motion were Sens. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, Wallop, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> police opened fire today on a crowd of Moslems protesting <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book `` The Satanic Verses,'' and at least 10 people were killed and 25 injured, authorities said. Police said about 5,000 Moslems started the protest in the center of the city after weekly prayers. Protesters set fire to several state-run buses and other vehicles and attacked policemen on duty, said an officer. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported 10 killed and 38 injured, six of them critically. Friday is <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly holy day, and anti-Rushdie protests were reported elsewhere in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. There were no other reports of violence. The <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> demonstrators, almost all Moslems, ignored a police ban on the assembly of more than five people in public places. The ban was imposed after some Moslems announced plans to protest <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, which some say insults Islam. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> in 1947 but now lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he has been in hiding since Feb. 14 when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said he should be killed and Iranian clerics placed a $ 5.2 million bounty on the author's head. Protests were held in several other Indian cities, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agencies said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, about 400 Moslems marched to the British High Commission, or embassy in the diplomatic neighborhood and protested the novel. At least one person was killed in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state Feb. 13 during a demonstration against the book. Six people were killed in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 12 when police opened fire on a crowd that tried to set fire to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> to demand the book be banned. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> banned <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book in November, fearing it could cause unrest. More than 90 million Moslems live in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, forming about 11 percent of the population of 880 million. Hindus account for 82 percent of the population.

 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 landed in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> today with `` a big hole in the fuselage,'' according to a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who said `` some passengers are missing.'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said the agency had information that perhaps five or six passengers were missing. The pilot of the flight from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Aukland </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, reported trouble in one right-side engine and then in the other right-side engine, <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. He then returned to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` When he landed, there was a big hole in the right side of the fuselage near the right front door and some passengers were missing,'' <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said. Information about the incident on Flight 811 was sketchy, he said. The plane left <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> at 7:53 a.m. EST, and the pilot reported he had lost the No. 3 engine nine minutes later. Eight minutes after that, he reported lack of power in No. 4 engine. The plane landed at 8:34 a.m. EST. `` It's still early in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. There is a report of five or six passengers missing,'' said <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said he did not know how the hole in the fuselage and the engine trouble were related. `` There are a lot of possible scenarios,'' he said, noting that it could have been a `` contained engine failure,'' in which an engine part penetrates the fuselage. Or, he said, an explosion from the fuselage could affect the engines. `` Right now, we're just sitting here waiting for more information,'' <PERSON> Leyden </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 In its first report on human rights in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said today that Cuban prisoners complained they were tortured but that the government denied their claims. The 400-page report was compiled by a six-member team that visited <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for 10 days in September at the invitation of the government. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, made up of representatives from 43 nations, will begin discussing the report Tuesday. The investigating team said it received more than 1,600 human rights complaints, including 137 of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The allegations of torture were in a letter signed by 22 political detainees and handed to two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representatives who visited <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>'s Combinado del Este prison. `` The Cuban tormentors, advised by experts in political repression, mainly Russians and Czechs, inflict all kinds of torture,'' the letter said. The report said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s interior minister, Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representatives that `` a number of detainees or prisoners had in the past been beaten'' but that those responsible had been punished. `` He said there are no cases of torture,'' according to the report. Most of the complaints, 1,183 of them, came from Cubans who said it was `` difficult to leave the country either temporarily or permanently,'' according to the report. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has said that under an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 20,000 Cubans would be allowed to leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. During the first nine months of last year only 5,932 had left, and Vice President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was cited in the report as blaming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` non-compliance with the agreement.'' A considerable part of the report was devoted to statistics suggesting a vast improvement in education and health care under President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. It also quoted prominent cultural figures as praising the government's literacy campaign and promotion of cultural life. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team was headed by Ambassador <PERSON> Alioune </PERSON> <PERSON> Sene </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and included diplomats from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has charged that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are the world's worst human rights offenders, and says the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should send investigators to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> once a year as it does with other countries, including <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvado </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Despite being forced underground by an Iranian death order, the author of `` The Satanic Verses'' is not in bad spirits and is grateful for the support he has received _ especially from Moslems, his friends say. The death toll from protests related to <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book increased to 17 today when police opened fire on protesting Moslems in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, killing at least 10. Seven other people have died in demonstrations in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> ca n't be held responsible if a Moslem kills <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who was born into a Moslem family. He also demanded that Western nations say whether they agree with what `` The Satanic Verses'' says about Islam. Sources in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said today Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> sent a letter to his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, urging him to `` make clear that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> shares the ... wish to see <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> respect international obligations and renounce the use of violence.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, on a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour, has been granted a rare audience with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> told Moslems to kill the British author. Some say his book insults Islam. Moslem clerics in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> backed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s threat by offering up to $ 5.2 million for the death of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Indian news agencies reported anti-Rushdie protests in several cities today. Police in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> said about 5,000 Moslems set fire to buses and began attacking police officers. They said at least 10 people were killed and 25 injured when police opened fire. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that only <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s sister, literary agent and a few close friends know exactly where he is or have spoken with him since he went underground. One friend, writer <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, was quoted as telling the Times that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> `` is bearing up well, he is in relatively good spirits and is very gratified at all the support that he has received.'' He was quoted as saying <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> `` is also very aware that there are many, many devout Muslims all over the world who do not agree with <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> was quoted as saying the novelist `` does not feel under great strain or pressure ... but it is going to be very difficult for him now. He will be constantly haunted by the specter of death.'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, literary editor of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday he had talked with <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and the 41-year-old writer sounded `` all right.'' In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, External Affairs Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> was put under 24-hour police guard, the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today. It quoted aide <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarrazin </PERSON> as saying the security was imposed as a precaution after <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> withdrew its envoy from <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in protest Tuesday. Another Canadian official, Revenue Minister <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jelinek </PERSON>, was given police protection this week after receiving death threats for refusing to ban imports of the novel. Police in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> said today they had begun investigating a death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> by <PERSON> Altaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, vice-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finland-Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> told a leading newspaper, <PERSON> Uusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suomi </PERSON>, on Thursday that members of the society `` are prepared to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> if he comes to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether to expel <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokhari </PERSON>, a Pakistani-born councilman in <LOCATION> Skedsmo </LOCATION>, for saying in news interviews he would kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> if given the chance, local party chairman <PERSON> Tor </PERSON> <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulbrandsen </PERSON> said today. Detractors say the book insults Islam by portraying the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran rather than receiving it from God. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaking at weekly prayers in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, told Western nations: `` Moslems believe that you are a partner in its publication ... If not, say so.'' Moslems want to know how Western governments stand on the book so they know their `` duty,'' he said, without elaborating. The Danish newspaper Weekendavisen today published excerpts of `` The Satanic Verses.'' The newspaper also reported that <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> planned to go ahead with a $ 100 million business deal with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The editors said in a commentary they printed the excerpts to satisfy `` the public's right to form an opinion about the case, and to show solidarity with the author and the publishers.'' It said the state-run oil and natural gas company <ORGANIZATION> DONG </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> are about to tie up a deal in which <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> would broker a million tons of Iranian oil. In exchange, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would use the proceeds to buy Danish cheese and other products.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit challenging the state's new ban on Medicaid-funded abortions, saying it punishes a 15-year-old girl who became pregnant after being gang-raped. A hearing on the lawsuit, filed Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled today before Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausner </PERSON>. `` The law is imposing a double punishment on this person,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. The girl faces `` not only the punishment of being a victim of rape itself, but being essentially consigned to the lifetime consequences,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hausner </PERSON> could issue a temporary restraining order and ultimately a preliminary injunction clearing the way for a state-funded abortion. The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit, also filed on behalf of the girl's mother, is the first to challenge the ban passed by voters last November According to the lawsuit, the girl, whose name is being withheld, was raped last month by three men. The <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office said two men were in jail awaiting trial on second-degree criminal sexual conduct charges in the case The teen-ager, who is five weeks pregnant, wanted an abortion but was unable to afford the procedure because her family is on welfare, the lawsuit said. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleicher </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, the lawyers representing the girl, said the abortion ban should be overturned because it denies poor women equal access to health care. Courts in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have overturned similar abortion bans, allowing poor women in those states to again seek Medicaid-paid abortions, <PERSON> Gleicher </PERSON> said. Before Medicaid-funded abortions were banned in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the state spent about $ 6 million a year for some 18,500 abortions for poor women.

 A physician was ordered to surrender his license and submit to a comprehensive psychiatric examination after 12 former female patients accused him of sexual and ethical misconduct. In suspending Dr. <PERSON> Pravin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON>'s medical license for 90 days, the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that he presented a `` clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety'' and had engaged in `` immoral conduct.'' Two women have filed lawsuits against <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> contending he got them pregnant, then performed abortions without their knowledge. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brutchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertzinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, both of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, were the first to testify at a three-hour hearing that led to the board's action Several women then came forward and said <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> asked to perform pelvic exams on them despite their medical condition. One woman said <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> wanted to perform a pelvic examination on her when she sought help for a strep throat. <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON>, 38, an obstetrician-gynecologist who has a family practice in <LOCATION> Frankton </LOCATION>, did not attend the hearing. `` We know a lot of these allegations are lies and false. We'll get a chance to present our evidence to the licensing board soon and I'll be exonerated,'' <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday night The board pointed out that the 90-day suspension was the most severe action that could be taken before a formal complaint is filed and a final hearing is scheduled. Ms. <PERSON> Hertzinger </PERSON> claims she became pregnant with <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON>'s child in February 1983 after they became romantically involved. <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> is accused of administering drugs to Ms. <PERSON> Hertzinger </PERSON> eight months later, causing her to deliver the fetus at his home. He told her the baby was stillborn and he had taken care of it, Ms. <PERSON> Hertzinger </PERSON> said. However, Ms. <PERSON> Hertzinger </PERSON> claims that she was conscious during part of the procedure and heard a baby's cry. Asked later if she regretted not coming forward with her disclosures earlier, Ms. <PERSON> Hertzinger </PERSON> said, `` It took all the numbers that we had here today to convince them of the severity and the danger that Doctor <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> was causing.'' Ms. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> claims <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> fathered her unborn child and then aborted the fetus with a medical instrument Jan. 9, 1988. After reviewing <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON>'s educational training and background, board member Dr. <PERSON> Deanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Porte-Keene </PERSON> expressed concern over the doctor's qualifications to practice as an obstetrician. `` I'd be interested to know how this doctor even advertises himself as an obstetrician,'' she said. `` I'm certainly raising a lot of questions as to what his qualifications are as a physician, let alone his personal conduct, which is appalling.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hertzinger </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> have taped a segment of the television talk show `` Geraldo'' that is scheduled to air March 7. A third woman, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON>, 34, a former employee of <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON>'s, said she went to him for an examination in August 1982 when she suspected she had become pregnant by her husband. She said <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> examined her with medical instruments and told her she was n't pregnant. She said she experienced pain during the exam and later began bleeding. Mrs. <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said she went to another doctor who examined her and told her she had undergone an abortion. Mrs. <PERSON> Bickel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> eventually told her `` that he thought if I'd had a child by anyone else, I would n't want him.'' Telling similar stories, almost all of the women testified that <PERSON> Thakkar </PERSON> told them they were beautiful, asked questions about their sex lives and asked them for dates while under his care. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> called the allegations `` probably the worst abuse of physician-patient trust that I've seen since I've been on the board.''

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people held a rally in southern <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province today to support miners who are striking to protest ethnic discrimination and to demand the resignation of a Communist Party chief. Yugoslav leaders rushed to <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, to prevent possible ethnic clashes between the Albanian majority and <PERSON> Slav </PERSON> minority. More than 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners, some on a hunger strike, have refused to leave their pits at the <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> lead and zinc mines since Monday. Tens of thousands of people have joined sympathy rallies and strikes across the province of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, one of six Yugoslav republics. Most private shops and some schools in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> closed today. About 3,000 university students and their professors today spent a second night in a <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> sports hall to show solidarity. <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> and the Serbian republic's party boss, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> and met with <ORGANIZATION> Kosovo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>, whose resignation the strikers demand. The miners consider <PERSON> Morina </PERSON> an ally of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who is trying to gain greater Serbian control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The mainly Moslem Albanians make up more than 85 percent of the province's population, and they claim his move would result in discrimination against them by Serbs, who are predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>. Since the mine action began, 150 strikers have asked for medical help and 16 have been hospitalized, the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. A provincial spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, today denied reports published Thursday that 17 people had already been hospitalized. He said a medical facility had been set up at the site. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> Thursday, the Serbian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved proposed changes in the republic's constitution that would give <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> sovereignty over its provinces, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, and increase the republic's powers over defense and state security, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. However, the ammendments must also be approved by the assemblies of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> before they can be enforced. On Thursday, <PERSON> Yugoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Raif </PERSON> <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> as saying that constitutional changes would not `` endanger'' any nationality in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON> met Thursday evening with representatives of the striking miners and appealed to them to leave the pits and begin talks with authorities over their demands.

<TEXT>
 Increases today in the discount and prime lending rates, which make borrowing more expensive, are a direct outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to crack down on inflation, economists say. The nation's central bank is trying to slow down the economy and crush inflation by draining reserves from the banking system. That has boosted short-term interest rates, although long-term rates have risen relatively little. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> today raised its discount rate, which it charges on loans to member banks, to 7 percent from 6.5 percent, its highest level since April 1986. Major banks already had begun raising their prime rate, a benchmark for a wide range of consumer and business loans, to 11.5 percent from 11 percent, effective today. That move was made in response to the recent rise in short-term interest rates, which increases the banks' own costs of borrowing. <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> announced the increases Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and other major banks followed suit today. The increase in the prime rate is more significant to businesses and consumers because of its direct effect on loan rates such as adjustable-rate mortgages. The discount rate is relatively little used and the latest increase only partially catches it up with increases in other rates. The prime is at its highest level since November 1984. In the past year the rate has jumped 3 percentage points. The most recent rise, to 11 percent from 10.5 percent, was on Feb. 10. Banks are passing along higher rates because their own cost of funds has risen and demand for loans remains strong, said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, director of trade and economics for the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The prime rate is like any other price; it's set by both supply and demand. They're going to get the best price they can,'' <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said it was reacting to rises in other rates, not anticipating them, when it raised its prime rate. `` The prime's a laggard rate,'' said <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitel </PERSON>, a senior vice president. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer prices rose in January at an annual rate of 7.2 percent, the highest in two years. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> called the inflation trend disturbing and vowed to keep upward pressure on rates until the pinch succeeds in squeezing inflation out of the economy. Since February 1988 the federal funds rate has jumped by more than 3 percentage points. This rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, is closely controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> drained reserves from the banking system on Thursday, seemingly indicating that it wants to keep the federal funds rate somewhere between 9.5 percent and 9.75 percent, said <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martini </PERSON>, an economist at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Sanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Banks typically set their prime rate about 2 percentage points above the federal funds rate, which would translate to a prime of 11.5 percent to 11.75 percent, <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> said. `` This is essentially a correctly placed prime,'' <PERSON> Martini </PERSON> said. Increases in rates have not slowed the economy much so far. One reason is that long-term rates have not risen much because investors have been confident of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s determination to control inflation. Long-term rates edge up when investors begin to lose confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and demand higher rates to compensate for expected inflation.

<TEXT>
 An Afghan guerrilla leader today called on other countries to recognize the interim government the insurgents formed for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and predicted the Soviet-backed rulers in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will be overthrown. <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, who was recently elected president of the interim government, also offered an amnesty for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government troops if they switch sides in the 10-year-old civil war Fellow guerrilla fighters based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today reportedly rejected the interim government the insurgents hope will take over if President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s communist government falls in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. At a news conference ending a stormy three-week meeting of Pakistan-based guerrillas, <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> said the guerrilla government would become functional inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within a month, `` God willing.'' He asked foreign countries to recognize the proposed government and for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to give it a General Assembly seat. The religious and political strains among the guerrillas were evident when their council elected <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, considered a moderate among the Moslem guerrillas, as president and and <PERSON> Rasul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyaf </PERSON>, a fundamentalist from the <ORGANIZATION> Ittehad-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, as premier. Fundamentalist factions advocate a strict Moslem system, and moderates have favored a broad-based government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> embracing Islam as its official religion. Afghan Shiite guerrillas, most of whom are in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, boycotted the 440-delegate council after the Pakistan-based guerrillas, the majority of whom are Sunni Moslem, refused to give them the representation they sought. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported today that leaders of the smaller Iran-based resistance rejected the appointment of the interim government, saying they were denied representation to the council. The radio quoted <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, spokesman for the Iran-based alliance, as saying: `` We consider the formation of the interim government as one sided, and can not recognize it.'' The report was monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The Shiites, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s largest minority, represent only 17 percent of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s population of 15 million but make up 40 percent of the 5 million refugees who have fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Moslem guerrillas have fought the government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since the communists seized power in a violent 1978 coup. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> withdrew its troops by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord. Guerrilla and Western observers have predicted <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will fall within months in the absence of Soviet forces, but <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> says his army is strong enough to withstand a guerrilla assault. A Western diplomatic source, speaking in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on condition he not be further identified, said: `` I think it's too early to talk about recognition. Their first test will be to get a capital.'' He said the first movement toward the world's acceptance of the guerrilla government might be a `` de-recognition of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>.'' Communist forces, heavily armed by the departing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, hold the capital and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s key cities but insurgents, backed mainly by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, reportedly control about 90 percent of the countryside.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> suggested the Nicaraguan rebels stage a `` suicide mission'' to destroy Soviet-made helicopters before the Sandinista government could decimate the Contras, a witness said today at the Iran-Contra trial. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified that in November 1984 he delivered from North to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> maps and photographs of the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> airport where the helicopters were being assembled. Before leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said, <PERSON> North </PERSON> outlined his proposal for attacking the Soviet Hind helicopters, which had been delivered to the airport outside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s capital. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> described the armor-clad Hind helicopter as `` the most dangerous helicopter in the world.'' North was `` concerned if these weapons, these platforms, were targeted against the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> resistance, it would decimate it,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. The helicopter, used by the Soviets in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, `` could put a bullet in every square inch of a football field in 10 seconds,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. North `` felt it would be in the best interests of the resistance if they could stage an attack on the airport and destroy the helicopters before they became operational,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, the third prosecution witness in the trial against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. North envisioned `` it would be a suicide mission undertaken by the pilots'' who would not have enough fuel to return to their base, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who is testifying under an immunity agreement with independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, said he delivered the maps and photographs to <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> during a trip he made to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> later that month. North is accused of, among other things, lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when he denied giving the rebels tactical military advice while <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to the Contras. The ban took effect about a month before <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he delivered the maps and photographs to <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and outlined the mission as proposed by <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said he would discuss the proposal with rebel pilots but `` he did n't make a commitment one way or another,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> recalled. Several months earlier, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a former aide to then-Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., now the vice president, said he discussed with <PERSON> North </PERSON> a proposal to set up a non-profit tax-exempt foundation to raise humanitarian assistance for the Contras after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> shut off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> North </PERSON> discussed the fact that such an organization could n't be used `` to raise money for military goods.'' North is also accused of conspiring to violate tax laws by setting up a tax-exempt foundation to raise money to help arm the rebels. North, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel and former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, is charged with 12 felony counts arising from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. In testimony on Wednesday, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> helped defense lawyers establish that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s close working relationship with the Contras was an open secret in official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> despite the aid ban imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Government officials, particularly at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, constantly referred the Contras to North, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` If we had a request or some kind of a grievance, they would say: ` talk to <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON>.''' `` Everybody knew we dealt with him: in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` For us, he was the representative of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government; he was our contact.'' But <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> conceded to prosecutors that he could n't recall talking with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> about the kind of help <PERSON> North </PERSON> was lending the Contras. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said he had franker discussions with the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, to whom he said he referred `` as Uncle Bill.'' `` I was more explicit as to our situation and our problems with Director <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> than I ever was with the president,'' the Contra leader said. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> testified he did n't expect that <PERSON> North </PERSON> would use any of the $ 90,000 for personal expenses. But he said he never demanded an accounting because `` I had absolute trust in what Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> was doing.'' He was asked by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> if he ever complained to prosecutors that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had `` misappropriated any of the travelers checks you gave him.'' `` Not at all, to any one,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> replied. `` To this day, I believe he acted properly.'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> appeared to be a reluctant prosecution witness, repeatedly telling <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> he could n't recall a 1985 meeting in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s office involving retired Army Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, who helped the Contras buy $ 5 million worth of weapons, and arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general. But under questioning by <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> had little difficulty remembering details of meetings he and other Contra leaders had with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which North had arranged. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> showed the jury pictures of <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and the other Contra leaders posing with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>. One picture of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> posing with Contra leaders was used by the rebels as `` clear evidence of the support of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the freedom fighters,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. Another picture bore an inscription from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> that said: `` Your struggle for justice and democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will prevail.'' `` Those were very heartfelt words,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said.

 A dentist faces up to five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine for forging the signature of a man whose mummified corpse was tended for nine years by his wife and children in their home. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, 57, was convicted of forgery by a <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury Thrusday after two hours of deliberation. He was accused of helping forge the name of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> on a document granting power of attorney to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>, in 1984, five years after <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' death at age 39. <LOCATION> Knox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> released <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> on a $ 55,000 bond and set no sentencing date. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, who faces up to five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine, showed no emotion as he heard the verdict. `` We intend to appeal. I am not very happy with the decision of the jury,'' defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepmeyer </PERSON> said as <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> stood silently nearby. `` I feel he's anything but a criminal.'' In closing arguments, <PERSON> Pepmeyer </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> `` was simply trying to help Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> refinance a house'' when he helped forge her husband's signature. But prosecutors said <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> knew <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was dead and signed the document with intent to defraud. The signature was accepted by a bank, which refinanced the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> family home in rural <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a diabetic, died after he joined a holistic group and stopped taking insulin. Authorities say there were no signs of foul play. Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 43, kept her husband's corpse in the family home from his death May 12, 1979, until authorities discovered it Jan. 29, 1988. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON> told the court that he committed no crime and gained nothing when he tried to help Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> keep the home where she and her two children _ <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, now 18, and <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, now 16 _ had tended the corpse. Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a registered nurse, pleaded guilty last March to forgery and failure to report a death, and was sentenced to 12 days in jail and placed on two years' probation. <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>, who became a live-in guest at the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> home in 1986 and described himself as a `` nutritional adviser'' to the family, was acquitted of an additional felony charge of cruelty to the <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' children The defendant had been accused of teaching the teen-agers about suicide, black magic and communication with the dead.

 A top <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police official under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in connection with a car theft ring has resigned, a police spokeswoman said today. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Haro </PERSON> resigned late Thursday, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Carmela </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. She did not give a reason for <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Haro </PERSON>'s resignation and said she did n't know if it had been accepted President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Haro </PERSON> head of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s police intelligence unit shortly after he took office in December. <PERSON> Nazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Haro </PERSON>, 60, spent 20 years with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, the equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Couple Won't Seek Custody Of Girl They Believe Was Swapped At Birth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A couple who have claimed in lawsuits that a 10-year-old girl is the daughter they lost in a baby swap in a hospital nursery now say they have decided not to seek custody of her, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> say they would settle for a chance to visit with the <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> girl, and hope to incorporate her into some sort of extended family so they could spend time with her while she is growing up, The <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` We feel that we should not be denied the right to know that girl as a child,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> said. The Twiggs, of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, say statements by a lawyer in their longstanding court battle suggesting they would seek custody of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> were part of his strategy. They once considered it, but later ruled it out. `` You take a step back and say, ` what is in the best interest of everybody involved?''' Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. The Twiggs maintain they brought the wrong child home from <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> in 1978, and that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> took their child. The girls were the only white female infants in the hospital at the time. The child the Twiggs raised, named <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, died of a congenital heart defect last August. They learned from blood tests that she was not their real daughter. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> is fighting to block a genetic test the Twiggs want performed to determine <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s parentage. Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that she decided to talk in part because of the growing public perception that she and her husband are being unfair to <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>. The Twiggs say they have received hate mail comparing them to terrorists. Their eldest daughter, <PERSON> Irisa </PERSON>, 20, was sneered at by a fellow member of a health club, who learned her last name and said: `` Oh, I know who you are.'' <PERSON> Irisa </PERSON> said she wants to know if she and <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> are related. `` Maybe we could be friends one day, and sisters after that,'' she said. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> roofing supply salesman, said in December that <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> fears the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> will remove her from the only home she knows and that she inscribed a drawing she gave him for Christmas: `` I hate the Twiggs. I want them to go away.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> says the ill will since the case has been in the limelight is undeserved. She said she and her husband first considered seeking custody because they suspected <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> participated in the alleged baby-swap, making him an unfit parent. They say they changed their minds, in part because there was no evidence to support that. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>' first wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, died of cancer in 1981. He remarried, but was divorced. The <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> sued the hospital for $ 100 million. They dropped the lawsuit late in 1988 on a technicality, saying they planned to refile. They are seeking genetic testing of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> in a separate lawsuit.

<HEAD>Women Named to State-Level Cabinet Positions Increased More Than
15 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of women appointed to state-level cabinet positions by governors has increased more than 15 percent in two years, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> said today. The group released its study of governors' appointments and said that since 1981, the number of women appointed to such posts has increased 114 percent. `` Our new study confirms that the message of women's abilities and political savvy is being heard by goverors of both parties and in all regions of the country,'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON>, head of the bipartisan women's political organization. The survey rated the 50 governors based on the percentage of women appointed to their cabinets. Ranked first was <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Democratic Gov <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, whose 7 cabinet posts include three women, or 43 percent. Ranked last was Missouri's Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, who has no women in his cabinet. <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> `` is out of synch'' with the rest of the states and has not recognized the political and leadership talents of women. The group said 150 women hold the state jobs in 1989, up from 70 in 1981 and 130 in 1987. She said there appeared to be no difference between <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors in appointing women. Four of the top 10 governors in the group's rankings were Republicans. After <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, the governors with the most appointed women in cabinet jobs were: <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> are Republicans.

<TEXT>
 A Lebanese Shiite Moslem was sentenced to life imprisonment today for the 1987 hijack of an Air Afrique jetliner in which he killed a French passenger and seriously wounded a flight attendant. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s highest court convicted <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> on all seven charges against him, including murder, attempted murder and hostage-taking. The 22-year-old <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, who previously said a life sentence would be `` no problem,'' rose from his chair but showed no emotion when the verdict was read. He will be eligible for parole in 15 years. The ruling by the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> followed a four-day trial in which the prosecution called <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> a `` killer blinded by conviction.'' Defense attorneys had sought a conviction on the lesser charge of manslaughter, claiming <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> acted on reflex when he fatally shot <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON>, 28. They said testimony did not disprove their contention that the victim had made a threatening move. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> was also ordered to pay damages of $ 556,000 to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afrique </ORGANIZATION> and a total of $ 101,000 to <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON>'s family, the flight attendent and a second passenger he threatened. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> commandeered an Air Afrique DC-10 on a flight from <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on July 24, 1987, to press demands for the release of Lebanese and Palestinians held by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. After gaining control of the plane over northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, he demanded to be flown to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> but agreed to a refueling stop at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON> after his deadline for readying the plane expired. Swiss police stormed the plane and arrested the lone hijacker after crew members overpowered him and passengers began fleeing the aircraft over safety chutes. Flight attendant <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Elouma </PERSON> was seriously injured by a shot from <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>'s pistol when he jumped the hijacker. Investigators said <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> boarded the plane at <LOCATION> Bangui </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, carrying 140 rounds of ammunition and 19 ounces of explosives. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> refused to testify in court about his alleged links to the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> group, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most militant faction. Presiding judge <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Leu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> told pre-trial interrogators that he joined <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after his release from an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prison. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most of the 15 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which include nine Americans. The longest-held foreign hostage is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> had told interrogators he received detailed instructions for his mission. Swiss officials said his demands during negotiations at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> airport included the release of the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brothers, two Lebanese arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as terror suspects. One of them, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, has been on trial in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> since last July on charges linked to the 1985 hijack of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> told the court he did not intend to kill <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON> but that he fired without aiming when the Frenchman, his head covered with a blanket, made a threatening move. `` I did not want to kill anyone, I only wanted to liberate my friends,'' said <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, who described himself as a `` soldier of God.'' But the flight steward told the court he saw <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> kill <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON> with a close-range shot to the head. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> acknowledged he paid a bribe equivalent to about $ 6 to elude police controls at the airport in <LOCATION> Bangui </LOCATION>, where his father reportedly had a business. He was expected to be returned to the maximum security wing of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s Champ-Dollon jail after sentencing. The <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> case gained wider dimensions with the kidnap of a <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegate in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last November. Swiss foreign minister <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> said the abduction was aimed gaining leniency for <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>. The delegate of the all-Swiss <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, was released after a month in the hands of captors who were never identified. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> said no concessions were made.

 An Irish soldier with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was killed today by unprovoked gunfire from Israeli-allied militiamen, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said Pvt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeela </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Dundalk </LOCATION>, was shot in the chest by machine gun fire from a <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> position overlooking an <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> post in the village of <LOCATION> Hadatta </LOCATION>. `` Death was instantaneous,'' said <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>. `` The fire was not provoked.'' <PERSON> Lars-Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahlgren </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force, visited the village later in the day and told reporters: `` I condemn the senseless killing of one of my soldiers.'' Most members of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> are Christians. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> trains and finances the militia, which helps 1,000 Israeli troops patrol the Jewish state's self-designated `` security zone'' in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established the eight-to-10 mile zone in 1985 after withdrawing most of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Tension increased recently between the militia and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force, and two Scandanavian soldiers were wounded earlier this month. The 5,800-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force, made up of contingents from nine nations, was deployed in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1978 under a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate. Since then, 160 peacekeepers have been killed. Today's killing brought to 27 the number of Irish soldiers killed. That nation's batallion has 700 troops.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, in town for the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, met today with top Japanese leaders and told them not to distort their nation's militaristic past, a government source said. Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> told parliament last week it was unclear whether <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had been an aggressor in World War II and that historians would have to judge <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s role. The comments drew criticism from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, which suffered a brutal occupation by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> before and during the war. Some of those nations continued their criticism today with demonstrations and newspaper editorials. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, meanwhile, met separately with <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno. During the meetings, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> `` stressed that there are sensitive topics between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and that it is necessary to come up with the correct interpretation of past history,'' a senior Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. `` No distortion should take place regarding the past because that would hurt the feelings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people and should be avoided,'' the official quoted <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> as telling Uno. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> met </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> in a hastily arranged `` courtesy call,'' one ministry official said. The two did not discuss the Japanese leader's comments, according to a ministry summary of their talks. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s comments did not represent a change in Japanese policy toward the war, and he expressed regret that neighboring countries had `` misunderstood'' the prime minister's intention, ministry officials said. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> also was quoted as saying that relations between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were in `` good shape and progressing.''

<HEAD>Debate Storms Over Treatment Of 11-Year-Old Pregnant Girl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An 11-year-old pregnant girl was transferred from one hospital to another with her legs taped together to delay delivery, but both her premature twins died, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> has investigated the case and found that no laws were broken. But despite the finding, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer at <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that he believed the treatment of the girl violated state and federal laws. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said doctors at their hospital taped the girl's legs to protect her because she was not willing or able to keep her legs together, as complications of her pregnancy required. They then put her in an ambulance and sent her to Memorial, which has more advanced facilities for neo-natal care. One of the girl's babies was born dead at 6 ounces and the other died soon after birth at 9 ounces. The girl had been 21 to 24 weeks pregnant. Community's administrator, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>, accused Memorial hospital officials of pulling `` a stunt'' to try to discredit his hospital. `` This was absolutely the best medical thing you could do,'' said <PERSON> Rheb </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON>, spokesman for Community Hospital. `` They're trying to sensationalize this case.'' But Community officials acknowledged that the girl should not have been sent alone in the ambulance on Jan. 9 from their hospital to Memorial, and said that a nurse will accompany any patients transferred in the future. The two hospitals also disagreed on whether the girl was in active labor when Community sent her to Memorial. Doctors at the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a physicians' peer-review organization, and officials at the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> all found she was not, <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON> said. `` But even if she had been, we still could have transferred her if the benefits outweighed the risks,'' he said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, however, said it was obvious that the girl had been in labor.

<TEXT>
 The `` t'' issues _ <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, trade and technology transfer _ are on the table when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sips tea with Chinese leaders this weekend. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s two-day visit to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, starting Saturday, was to stress the positive aspects of Sino-American relations that have developed since the two nations established diplomatic ties 10 years ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for more than a year in 1974-75, was to be given an effusive welcome as an old friend of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But the first bilateral summit since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited in 1984 also offers both sides a chance to vent some touchy issues, and discuss the quickly improving ties between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and its longtime adversary, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` They'll be lightly skipping over a number of issues rather than boring in on one issue,'' said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition he not be named. Among the issues: _ <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Chinese leaders insist that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> remains the most serious problem in Sino-U.S. relations. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should play a more active role in bringing about a peaceful reunification of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with the mainland, and condemns continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to the Nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, estimated at $ 700 million in 1987. `` Some prominent Americans still cling to the hope of long-term control of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as an ` unsinkable aircraft carrier,''' <PERSON> Guo </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiangzhi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Taiwan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> wrote in a recent article. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has welcomed the lessening of tensions across the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> in the past several years, particularly <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s decision to ease travel and trade restrictions with the mainland But it says the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> question is one for the Chinese to solve themselves. Taiwanese groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to back self-determination for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> when he meets <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and other Chinese leaders. The <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government has expressed concern that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will push <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> into a mediator role. _ <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports Chinese claims to sovereignty over <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, but has concerns over alleged human rights violations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s suppression of pro-independence disturbances in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> over the past 18 months. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rejects criticisms of its human rights record, and says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional resolutions on <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> are unwarranted interference in its internal affairs. `` It is regrettable that a few people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still make unfair criticism on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs, and even want <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s affairs to be done according to their will,'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>, said recently. _ Technology transfer. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the only nation classified as `` friendly and non-allied'' by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export control system which is also subject to national security and <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION> controls when acquiring technology with potential military uses. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> COCOM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees exports to communist states, have moved to reduce the list of items which must be reviewed before being sold to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which badly needs Western technology for its modernization drive, says liberalization of exports has been too slow. `` This has not only inflicted losses on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but also tied the hands of American enterprises and weakened their competitiveness in the Chinese market,'' Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for several months last year froze further liberalization of export restrictions in reaction to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. _ Trade. Bilateral trade soared to about $ 13.5 billion last year, up from $ 10 billion in 1987, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> figures. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> accuses the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of protectionism, particularly against Chinese textiles, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> complains about lack of adequate protection for copyrights. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supports <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s application to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but is urging <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to first further reform its trading system to make its goods more competitive and less dependent on government subsidies. _ International issues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his visit is not meant to upstage Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who comes to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in May for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also say they welcome the normalization of long-strained Sino-Soviet relations, which will allow both nations to concentrate on economic reform. The Chinese say their improved relations with the Soviets will not affect Sino-American ties. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> both oppose <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is likely to ask the Chinese to ensure that withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will not lead to the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s return to power. Thirty-one <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a letter to urge <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to stop aiding the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are blamed for the deaths of 1 million of their countrymen during their bloody 1975-78 rule over the country. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said it will cease aiding the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ends its 10-year military presence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Chinese leaders are also likely to discuss tensions on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is close to the communist North and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the future of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s market-oriented reforms as it tries to overcome economic overheating and inflation also were expected to be dealt with

 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> employees went on strike Friday throughout <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to press demands for a new collective agreement to include salary raises linked to inflation. The 24-hour walkout at private and state-controlled banks was called by the 50,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> after the socialist government declined to discuss its demands. `` The walkout was a complete success. We have n't had such participation in years,'' said union president <PERSON> Theocharis </PERSON> <PERSON> Papamargaris </PERSON>. The union demands wage increases be linked to the inflation rate on an employee's overall salary, which includes fringe benefits, and not on their base pay. Inflation last year reached 14 percent. Average monthly wages for a bank employee are $ 335 in take-home pay or $ 570 if benefits are included, <PERSON> Papamargaris </PERSON> said. The federation has threatened a two-day strike beginning March 2.

 Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, once a champion of `` trickle-down'' economics, spent the night in a housing project as part of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s mission to take `` inventory'' of the nation's homeless and impoverished. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> toured housing alternatives for the poor and homeless today and Thursday and slept at the Opportunity Towers, a federally supported apartment complex for senior citizens and the handicapped. At the Bethesda-Brown homeless project today, which houses 44 people in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> called it `` a great experience to be here and see how you rebuild lives.'' `` My challenge is to use <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> as a catalyst to expand these projects and encourage others to start them. Of course it takes money and we will plan to get it,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I plan to be an advocate and I want to make a difference.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a lawyer for the Coalition for the Homeless who accompanied the new housing secretary, said the group `` wanted <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to see human faces. Ten minutes on a steam grate is worth 50 white papers.'' `` I hope this touches his heart,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said, `` but in any event, his political future will be linked with his success in battling homelessness.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who is closely identified with conservative `` supply-side'' economic theory, was accompanied on his tour by <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, Republicans <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>. At the Women of Hope, a permanent shelter for impoverished women, most of whom are mentally ill, the three listened as about 16 residents complained about the lack of affordable housing and jobs for unskilled workers. `` While we sit here in this room tonight, many of our sisters and brothers are out in the freezing cold,'' said Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Scullion </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nun who runs the Women of Hope. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the nation's fifth largest city, has a homeless population estimated at 10,000. Sister <PERSON> Scullion </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> that more federal emphasis and money are needed to lift the burden of the homeless from cities and to provide more affordable housing for low-income citizens. `` We want you to go tour and to talk, but more importantly ... the answer to helping is what happens when you go back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told reporters he had come to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> `` to talk with folks and to listen, to learn about the problems, to see what they've done and what I can do to be a catalyst, to make an impact, make a difference in this problem.'' `` It's a very human, real problem that exists and it's a national tragedy, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants me to not only inventory the problem but inventory some of the answers,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who plans to visit other cities to examine their housing problems. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who is acting as a tour guide, called <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s visit `` a non-ideological, novice's composite tour'' with as little time as possible spent in offices with politicians. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> stopped at a city-run shelter for homeless men, where most of the approximately 75 men sitting in plastic chairs seemed more concerned with getting a bed than talking to political leaders. `` It's hard to get in here, man,'' said <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 42. `` They call your name once _ if you do n't hear your name called, forget it.'' Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> visited a soup kitchen and a homeless shelter in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Viva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> shelter, he told residents that he came as an advocate for their needs, not as an adversary. `` We want to make some changes,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Viva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> that programs for the homeless suffered during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` So much money has gone to the military that the federal housing budget has been cut from $ 31 billion to $ 7 billion,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` That's why I'm here,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> answered. `` I want to find some answers to the problem of homelessness.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> planned to visit Dignity Housing, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> shelter for homeless women and their children, and several other housing alternatives, including a public housing project, before leaving this afternoon. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> spent two days in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last week, visiting housing projects, renewal programs, interim housing for the homeless, and privately financed developments aimed at low - and moderate-income families

 When it suits his purposes, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can be as talkative as the next guy. The president simply turns a photo `` op'' into a press `` availability.'' Reporters crowded around the president Friday evening, looking for his reaction to the 11-9 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> vote to reject <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> as secretary of defense. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acted undecided about whether he would answer their questions. `` I've got to get a ruling on whether this is a _ this is not a photo op,'' the president started out. He has declared that he wo n't entertain reporters' questions during photo-taking sessions, dubbed `` photo ops'' by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides. Then, standing in the evening dark by his limousine, its engine running, aides <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> at his side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided he could indeed field a few questions. `` This is what we call a press availability,'' he declared.

<TEXT>
 The defense minister has proposed a series of austerity measures in return for a government pledge not to cut the defense budget below the current level of about $ 2.65 billion a year. The proposals, including the withdrawal of 1,400 troops in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and restructuring of armed forces units, wo n't undermine <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s commitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, said Defense Minister Guy Coeme. The `` structural reforms'' of armed forces units, such as combining and scaling down some air force squadrons, closing a naval base and a navy training school, and pulling 1,400 of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s 27,000 troops back from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, will be discussed with the allies, he said The number of troops to be withdrawn was low enough so as not to be `` interpreted negatively'' by the allies, <PERSON> Coeme </PERSON> said. He said his proposals would save at least $ 51 million a year. `` The philosophy of our approach is that we will concentrate on our traditional strong points like moine-sweeping and anti-tank capabilities.'' Coeme urged against further cuts in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s annual defense budget. It amounts to $ 2.65 billion this year. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s defense efforts have long been a source of criticism. According to alliance figures, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> spent 3.4 percent of its gross national product on defense in 1980, which has since only declined.

<HEAD>Governors Appointing More Women to State Cabinets</HEAD>

 Governors are appointing record numbers of women to their state cabinets, more than doubling the total of eight years ago, a women's political group said Friday. The National Women's Political Caucus called for the federal government to follow suit. The group said its survey of the 50 states found 150 women in top appointed posts, with gains for women coming in all regions and among governors of both parties. It credited the governors with taking the lead in the appointment of women and said in a report, `` Clearly this is an area in which the federal government can learn a great deal from the states.'' Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is the only woman heading one of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's 14 Cabinet departments. The number of women in state cabinet posts is up from 70 in 1981 and 130 in 1987, the group said. Women now hold 21 percent of all state cabinet jobs nationwide. `` No doubt about it _ the nation's governors, with few exceptions are recognizing that qualified, savvy and experienced women have joined the poitical landscape,'' <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON>, head of the bipartisan women's political group, said at a news conference. But, she added, `` We look forward to the time when such studies as this are no longer needed.'' The survey, released a ppeared to be no difference between <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors in appointing women. Four of the top 10 governors in the group's rankings were Republicans. After <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, the governors with the most appointed women in cabinet jobs were: <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON> are Republicans. The others are Democrats. Noting the high ranking of several Southern governors, <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> said, `` I think we can safely say that the old stereotype that Southern politicians are resistant to change has effectively been broken.'' She also said that while women first made gains by appointment to administrative or health-related posts, they now are increasingly being appointed to jobs formerly associated with men, including those dealing with water, energy and natural resources, she said. <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON> suggested the group's survey, which it has released in past years, with providing `` pressure by comparision'' on governors. The study commended New Mexico Gov. <PERSON> Garey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>, a Republican with only one woman cabinet appointee in 1987, for recruiting two additional women to his cabinet since then.

 No decison has been made on how to squeeze $ 2 billion out of farm programs to meet federal spending goals, but analysts are looking at all possibilities, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Friday. `` We'll find a way to do so, because that's a requirement of the -LRB- budget -RRB- process,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told reporters. `` Agriculture will have to play its part in that process.'' He added: `` We'll look everywhere, obviously ... it'll have to be done on the basis of economic analysis. We're not going to do it in an arbitrary or capricious way, and that means analyzing all the options and combinations of options.'' About $ 2 billion will have to be whittled from programs in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Those cuts were not specified in the budget proposals submitted by the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in January and were left open to be negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> served for 3 -LCB- years as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tapped him to be secretary of agriculture. No senior aides to <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have yet been announced by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and key jobs are still being carried out by holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. However, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said at a news conference that he was hopeful an announcement would be made soon on the No. 2 post of deputy secretary, probably `` within the next few days.'' Reports circulated last week that <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and some presidential aides had been bickering over filling the deputy secretary job, with <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> favoring <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> agricultural commissioner, or <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, a cotton warehouseman from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. But there were claims that White House pressure had developed for former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> governor <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he had been interviewed by <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> several weeks earlier. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said that the reports of his bickering with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were `` completely false'' and that there had been no disagreement whatsoever with the White House. Options for cutting <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> farm program spending include further reductions in target prices for major crops, including wheat, corn and cotton. Those are prices used in a formula to help determine federal subsidies to farmers who participate in annual crop programs.

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> today when Palestinians dropped a large cement block on his head from a rooftop, military sources and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Troops clamped a curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' 120,000 residents and launched house-to-house searches, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Residents heard sporadic gunfire in the area, the reports said. Military sources said the cement block was dropped during a clash in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' open air market. Also today, nine Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official was quoted as saying he is trying to arrange a meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Arab hospital officials said the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> casualties included a 30-year-old woman from the <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camp who is nine months pregnant. Doctors said she was shot in the back but was not in serious condition. They said a 4-year-old boy was wounded in the right arm in the Maghazi refugee camp. An army spokeswoman said she was checking the reports. At least 385 Palestinians and 17 Israelis, including the soldier killed today, have died in the 14-month Arab revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s political adviser, was quoted as saying he hopes to meet <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has left for a fund-raising tour in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and was scheduled to go to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> next week, said a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He declined to elaborate. `` I'm working through British political figures in the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to arrange a meeting with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> who will visit <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I meet him I will ask him ` why do you shoot children?''' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. `` He will of course ask me ` why are you rioting?''' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has met extensively with Palestinian officials in the occupied lands. However, he has said he would not negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers a terrorist organization. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> public opinion is important to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and could significantly influence the peace process. However, he said, mistrust is widespread on both sides. `` In the meantime, a majority of the Israelis do n't believe the Palestinians, but I must say that the situation is similar in the Palestinian public with regard to the Israelis,'' he was quoted as saying. Recent polls have indicated that the majority of Israelis support negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> under certain conditions. In other developments, the army has appointed a brigadier general to investigate mysterious explosions that have killed three Palestinian children and wounded at least 11 others in the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Military officials have said the area, northeast of the city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, is an air force training zone and that the explosives might have been flares dropped during maneuvers. The most recent incident occurred Thursday when 19-year-old shepherd was burned in the hands and face after handling an unidentified object. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON> described the object as rectangular and shiny, similar to the flares used by the air force.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is meeting the four men who guide modern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> during his two-day visit starting Saturday. Two of them _ top leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> _ are octogenarians, representatives of the old guard of pre-liberation revolutionaries. The other two _ Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> _ are younger leaders concerned less with ideology and more with guiding <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1 billion people toward a 21st century of economic prosperity. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, is the architect of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s bold experiments in economic reform. He holds no official position except chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, but no one questions <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is the man in charge. A former <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> comissar who helped lead the Communists to victory in 1949, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is a survivor of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s political wars who has spent the past decade undoing much of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s ideological heritage. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was purged during the leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution as a `` capitalist roader,'' but battled his way back after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s death in 1976. By the end of the 1970s he was <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s undisputed leader. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s concept of the primacy of class struggle, and made economic development his top priority. In the past decade he has abolished the commune, revived the family farm and encouraged private enterprise. He has also promoted the still-unfinished tasks of freeing factory managers from bureaucratic interference, creating a price system based on market forces rather than government dictum and forging a well-trained, mobile labor force. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has tolerated slow expansion of intellectual and artistic freedoms and has encouraged increased contacts with the outside world, particularly the West. In 1979 he toured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to mark the establishment of U.S.-China relations. But politically, his instincts are conservative. Several times he has cracked down on political dissent when he felt it threatened the supremacy of the party or the nation's stability. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, 81, became <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s fourth president, or head of state, in April last year. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, was born in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province and played an active role in <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> campaigns of the 1930s and 1940s. Purged during the Cultural Revolution, the career military man returned to public office in the late 1970s and in 1982 was appointed permanent vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. As senior military officer on the commission, he backed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s 1985 decision to end the wartime footing of the army and cut 1 million troops from the force of more than 4 million The post of president is largely ceremonial, and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> is not thought to be an initiator of policy. But he does have a voice because of his close ties to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and his seat on the 17-member party Politburo, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s top decision-making body. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, 69, for the past decade has been <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading advocate of speed and boldness in initiating economic reforms. He made his reputation as party secretary and governor of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> in the late 1970s, when he led the nation in highly successful experiments in restoring family farming. In 1980 <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> brought him to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and he was quickly named premier, a post he held until 1987. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> became acting general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in January 1987 following the ouster of fellow reformist <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, who was blamed for pro-democracy student unrest. He officially took over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most powerful post the following November. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, known for his immaculately tailored Western suits, his cosmopolitan manner and his love for golf, has been widely regarded as the man most likely to succeed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader. However, there have also been persistent reports, publicly denied by Chinese officials, that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s stature has suffered during <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s recent economic woes. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> reportedly has been criticized for pushing decentralization and price reforms too quickly, contributing to the out-of-control pace of industrial growth and inflation of more than 20 percent. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> now has joined the more cautious Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> in backing a two-year slowdown in reform while the government tries to restore eocnomic growth to a manageable level. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, 60, in April completes his first full year as premier, or head of government. An electrical engineer who studied in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the 1950s, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> represents the new breed of technocrats now filling the ranks of the Chinese government. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has tried, with only limited sucess, to shake off the impression that he is a conservative who opposes <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s efforts to move quickly in introducing market-oriented reforms. He consistently supports the reforms, but with the qualifier that they not be implemented at a speed that will threaten economic or social stability. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> appeared to have gained the upper hand last September when the government announced its two-year hold on reforms and said central authorities would reimpose controls in such areas as banking and foreign trade. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, was cared for by the late Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> after his father was killed by the Nationalists when <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was 3 years old. He joined the party at age 17. After returning from six years in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1954, he held a number of important engineering posts, and was named minister of power industry in 1979. He was appointed vice premier in 1983 and served as education minister from 1985. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, is a member of the five-member <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the pinnacle of power within the party.

 They came to mourn Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, but world leaders used the gathering for a flurry of mini-summits on issues ranging from <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace and the furor over `` The Satanic Verses'' to just getting acquainted. `` With <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> turning out to be the stage for funeral diplomacy, the world's attention converged on <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' the liberal-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial, saying <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should `` strive to enhance our international trust.'' The agreement between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> to normalize relations, suspended 22 years ago, was the biggest result of the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> talks. It came from a meeting Thursday between President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>. The long freeze had resulted from <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> allegations that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> backed a 1965 communist coup attempt against the <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> government. The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> figured in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meetings with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, Israeli President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. White House officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meetings in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, most lasting no more than 30 minutes, mainly were general discussions and were not intended to delve into detail. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said `` there are perhaps some opportunities out there with respect to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process that have n't existed before.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who had conferred at home with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts, met in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Spokesmen said they also agreed that recent diplomatic efforts have brought the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> closer to peace. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> conferred with <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, but they reportedly were unable to reduce differences over a proposed international peace conference. There were delegations from 163 nations at Friday's funeral, and the Soviets were among the first to arrive. They quickly took up efforts to improve relations with <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, which insists that any substantial warming must await the return of a group of islands off northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> occupied by the Soviets since the end of World War II. British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> sought <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s support for his country's condemnation of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s death threat against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, the author of `` The Satanic Verses,'' a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> opposed any international leader advocating murder, but said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had no plans to withdraw its ambassador in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> dined Friday with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister for discussions on <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the British colony that is to return to Chinese rule in 1997. Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> had meetings set with at least three dozen foreign dignitaries, and an unscheduled talk Friday with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>, who also met with Uno. Foreign Ministry officials said that <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> discussed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s remarks last week that it would be up to historians to decide whether <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was an aggressor in World War II. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> did not discuss the issue with <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. `` No distortion should take place regarding the past because that would hurt the feelings of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people and should be avoided,'' one official quoted <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> as telling Uno. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s real intention was misunderstood, the officials said. After earlier protests in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Japanese officials said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was not trying to deny the suffering it had inflicted on its neighbors. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and assured her of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support and noted that his administration is asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 200 million in aid for her country, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Aid also figured in <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s talks with Brazilian President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> promised to send a mission to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to consider its request for new credits that could total more than $ 1 billion. On Friday, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> took up the U.S.-Japan agreement on joint development of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next fighter plane, which some American congressmen say would mean transferring sophisticated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology to potential competitors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> denies that. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also met Friday with <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Baudouin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, Italian President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a private dinner with King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanked Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> `` for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s courageous efforts to help <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> also met with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, and they agreed to cooperate in agriculture.

 The cost of cleaning up radioactive and toxic wastes at the government's 12-state nuclear weapons complex is likely to exceed the official $ 63 billion estimate, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for environment, said a firm estimate for cleanup costs was not yet possible because the department is uncertain how badly the environment has been damaged at many of the weapons plants. `` There's a strong chance that these costs will go higher'' than $ 63 billion, he said, adding that projected costs are likely to escalate as more detailed information is learned about the extent of the soil and groundwater contamination. `` There's a lot of uncertainty at this point,'' he told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> said that while contamination at some sites could be cleaned up in two or three years, work at the most polluted plants `` will require decades to complete.'' He cited the <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Largo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, which makes electronic components for nuclear weapons, as a likely candidate for speedy cleanup, in part because the vinyl chloride contamination there is less far flung and is not radioactive. Among the most difficult cleanup jobs will be at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> said is the most polluted site in the entire complex, and the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, which produces a highly radioactive gas. There has been extensive contamination of soil and groundwater at these sites, dating back to the early years of operation in the 1950s. Key elements of the weapons complex, including parts of <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> and the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, have been closed down by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in recent months because of safety and technical problems. An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report issued last month said it would cost $ 52 billion to modernize the weapons complex, and another $ 29 billion to clean it up, over the next 21 years. The department has said the cleanup cost eventually would range up to $ 63 billion, plus another $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion for decommissioning and decontaminating parts of the complex that are permanently shut down. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigating arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, reiterated the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s position that some of the weapons plants are so badly polluted that they may never be cleaned up. He did not specify these plants. `` In the final analysis, some areas within the complex may be irreversibly contaminated,'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant comptroller general, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel. As a result, he said, these sites may simply be sealed off and never used again. Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, D-Colo., said sealing off sites would amount to creating `` national sacrifice zones,'' which he called `` utterly unacceptable. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, whose district includes the Rocky Flats weapons plant, called on the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to `` speed up dramatically'' its efforts to identify all the contamination problems and to clean them up. `` Our national defense and the future of the nuclear weapons complex itself will be very much at risk if that full cleanup is not undertaken,'' he said. Peach also criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for having failed to develop a comprehensive plan for cleaning up the nuclear waste despite having been urged by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> to do so three years ago. `` Recent DOE plans and reports have shed considerable light on the problems DOE faces; however, none of them taken individually or collectively provide an overall comprehensive environmental strategy,'' <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> told the hearing that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s designated energy secretary, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, was intent on moving quickly to develop a five-year action plan, based on currently available information, for cleaning up and modernizing the weapons complex.

 Flutes wailed in a misty forest Friday as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> buried Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who reigned for 62 years through militarism, ruin and the undreamed prosperity that sprang from it. Kings, leaders or representatives of 163 countries were present to pay their respects, making the $ 74 million funeral of the 87-year-old emperor the largest international gathering in modern history. Black-robed court musicians and attendants carrying shields, pikes and banners of yellow and white preceded the emperor's coffin to the mausoleum at <LOCATION> Hachioji </LOCATION>, 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, in the rites that marked the end of an era. An official carried white shoes that tradition says the emperor will wear to heaven. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was considered divine when he became emperor, descended like his ancestors from the sun goddess, but he renounced divinity after the crushing defeat of World War II. His coffin was placed on a cart, pulled 100 feet up a slope, lowered into a stone tomb dug into the hillside and sealed in with concrete. By flickering torchlight in the evening mist, the imperial family made offerings to his spirit. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> said objects buried with the emperor included the microscope he used in 50 years of research as a respected marine biologist and a list of rankings of wrestlers in the traditional sport of sumo, of which he was an avid fan. Palace officials would not confirm the report. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> news service said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was laid to rest in a white silk kimono but that a Western suit and tie, his customary dress, were buried with him. A 72-year-old farmer slashed his abdomen with a kitchen knife in an attempt at ritual suicide beside a war memorial on the southern island of <LOCATION> Kyushu </LOCATION>, leaving a note that he wanted to follow his emperor in death. He was reported in serious condition. Mayor <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, one of two Japanese cities on which atomic bombs were dropped, said the orations at <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral `` sounded as if they were avoiding reality The impression was that he existed only after the war.'' <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> police said a letter containing a bullet and a death threat was delivered to <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON> on Wednesday after he said the emperor bore some responsibility for World War II. A bomb exploded in an embankment about 20 minutes before the funeral motorcade passed on its way to the burial ground, scattering dirt on the road but injuring no one. It was the only violent incident reported in a day of ceremonies guarded by 32,000 police officers. Earlier in the day, 51 men in the court robes and headgear of ancient <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> carried <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s coffin on a bamboo-screened litter to a funeral hall of unvarnished cypress wood in the <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> Imperial Gardens. Musicians played a dirge on pipes, flutes, drum and gong. After several eulogies, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other foreign dignitaries walked to the coffin and bowed slightly to pay final respects. `` For the more than 60 years of your reign ... you shared in the people's joys and sorrows,'' Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> said in a farewell address to his father, who died of cancer Jan. 7. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 55, was dressed in black tie, tails and a black silk top hat. He marched in the procession in a near-freezing rain carrying his own umbrella, as did Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, 54; Crown Prince <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON>, 29, and other members of the imperial family. During a 13-hour day of funeral rites, the foreign dignitaries attended three hours of ceremonies in the gardens. They joined more than 9,000 Japanese political and business leaders, artists and athletes in two immense, heated white tents on either side of the path to the funeral hall. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arakawa </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said about 5,190 people were involved in 71 demonstrations across the country against the imperial system and 12 people were arrested. He said said seven of the arrests were made in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, including two people who broke through police lines and ran into a street on the funeral route. Funeral organizers divided the Shinto and lay rites at the <LOCATION> Shinjuku </LOCATION> gardens, drawing and reopening a black curtain between the two parts, because of demands that the constitutional separation of state and religion be upheld. Several members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> skipped the Shinto ceremony and attended only the part at which government leaders expressed condolences. The Communist Party boycotted the entire funeral, contending the religious and state-sponsored portions had been conducted as one. The postwar constitution that specifies separation of religion and state was written by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> `` ardently wished for world peace and the well-being of the Japanese people, and he always remained at one with them in the effort to overcome the nation's difficulties.'' Many stores, offices, factories and entertainment centers were closed Friday, which was declared a national holiday, but trains to ski resorts were reported full. `` We respect the emperor, but a holiday is a holiday,'' said <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazama </PERSON>, 37. He said he watched early funeral rites on TV before catching the train.

 A sheriff's deputy was arrested in the murder of three prostitutes and is being investigated in the slayings of six others who traded sex for drugs, police said today. A ballistics test has linked a gun found in the deputy's car to at least three of the killings, police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. Deputy <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, 40, a narcotics investigator who has been with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Department for 18 years, was spotted at 1:30 a.m. Thursday by police officers patrolling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> had been driving with a woman in an area where several of the women had been killed, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was arrested by investigators who had accompanied him to his home in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Rialto </LOCATION>, about 55 miles northeast of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He was arrested for investigation of murdering three women, but police were trying to determine whether <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was linked to the other recent slayings, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` We have ballistic matches on three homicides and three only,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said there is no indication the deputy is linked to any of another series of prostitute killings that terrorized <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> earlier this decade and became known colllectively as the South Side slayings. The name of the woman in the car with <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was not released. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said she told officers that she was getting scared before they arrived because she had been `` well briefed'' by police on the area's killings. The woman told investigators `` simply that he -LRB- <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> -RRB- wanted to go to the trunk of his vehicle,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. The gun that was recovered was in the trunk, although the woman did n't know that. At least nine women known in the streets as `` strawberries'' have been shot to death since 1985. The body of the last victim was found in November 1988. The same small-caliber handgun was used in all of the killings, authorities said. This is the second string of murders committed in recent years in the area south of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. As many as 18 women, mostly black prostitutes, were believed to be slain in the Southside Slayer murders, committed from September 1983 to July 1986. One man has been convicted in one of those deaths, and two other alleged assailants have been charged separately in seven of the slayings.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> leaders concluded their annual winter meeting Friday with a call on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make it tougher for employers to skim assets from pension funds and a vow to be a major force in the coming redrawing of congressional districts. The federation's Executive Council also condemned a recent <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reversal of a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> determination that imported multi-purpose vehicles were small trucks and therefore subject to a 25 percent import tariff. The protracted labor dispute at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> dominated the weeklong meeting, with leaders of the 14.1-million-member federation promising to back up 8,500 machinists and ground personnel planning to strike the airline next week. But labor also put on the record its positions on a variety of domestic and international issues with statements ranging from a call for an increased minimum wage to condemnation of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> for his death threats against `` Satanic Verses'' author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> Also included were resolutions supporting labor movements in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The Friday resolution on pensions said nearly 2 million workers have had their pensions jeopardized since 1980 by employers who use overfunded pension money for business purposes, primarily to help initiate or fight takeover attempts. `` Workers have a fundamental right to pension fund assets,'' the 35-member Executive Council said. `` Employers who terminate pension plans to skim off ` excess assets' violate that right and deprive workers and retirees of their pension protection.' The statement called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take a number of steps to discourage employers from dipping into or terminating pension funds, including provisions calling for distribution of excess assets between employers and plan beneficiaries. The post-election year session of the council was not as political as past gatherings, but the resolution on redistricting that will follow the 1990 census indicated labor would try to be a major force in maintaining Democratic majorities in both the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the majority of state legislatures. `` It is vital that the labor movement and its allies coordinate a long-term reapportionment strategy that assists state legislative candidates who are committed to programs that benefit working Americans and counterbalances conservative, anti-union efforts to gerrymander away liberal legislators,'' the council said. The resolution said the shape of redistricting would be affected by those elected to key posts in 1989 and 1990 elections and urged <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> affiliates to use their political action money and resources to support Project 500 and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for an <ORGANIZATION> Effective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, two liberal-oriented organizations involved in the debate on how the redistricting should be carried out. The resolution condemning <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s decision in the multi-purpose vehicle case was requested by <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. The initial Customs ruling would have made U.S.-made multi-purpose vehicles, predominantly smaller, four-wheel drive vehicles, more attractive in terms of price than those of foreign competitors, mainly Japanese auto makers. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has capitulated to foreign political pressure, pointlessly increasing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and undermining the jobs of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers,'' the council said. The council called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reinstate the Customs decision. The panel said its decision to involve organized labor in the debate over `` Satanic Verses'' stemmed from denial of free speech to labor organizers in numerous countries.

<TEXT>
 A prisoner infected with the AIDS virus was granted a royal pardon Friday because he was ostracized after other inmates learned of his illness. The pardon by King Olav V to prisoner <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> reversed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s late 1988 rejection of the inmate's plea for an early release, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> reported `` I'd given up all hope when I received word of the pardon. I'd like to forget these last few months in prison It was a nightmare that I would n't wish on anyone,'' said <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, 34. Word that <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> had the AIDS virus spread quickly through Ila Prison after guards were informed that he had tested positive in August 1987. Inmates boycotted the prison church and wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> demanding <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>'s removal as a church officer. As sexton, he handled bread and wine for communion and might accidently spread the virus, prisoners said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> rejected the demand but confirmed in a letter posted in the prison that <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> had the virus, which his attorney said caused the inmate to be isolated. `` Leaking word of <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>'s infection was a breach of professional secrecy by doctors,'' said <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Husdal </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Pluss </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s AIDS victims lobby. He said he applauded the decision and that it set an important precedent, according to the report. <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, who is Dutch, had served three years of a seven year sentence and will be expelled from <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> at once, according to the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Verdens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>. His offense was not reported, and neither prison nor <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials would say why he had been jailed. The pardon was made on the recommendation of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, once considered a god, was laid to rest Friday in a hillside forest with ancient ritual, the music of pipes, drum and gong, and a pair of white shoes to carry him to home to heaven. He was buried in a white silk kimono, but a Western suit and tie _ his customary dress _ were entombed with him. Also buried with him were a microscope he used in 50 years of research as a respected marine biologist and a list of rankings of wrestlers in the traditional sport of sumo, which <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> followed avidly, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> reported. Palace officials would not confirm the report. A heavily guarded procession carried <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s coffin to the mausoleum 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Inside the gates of the <ORGANIZATION> Musashi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION>, his son and successor Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> led the imperial family in burial ceremonies modeled on ancient Shinto rites. A 21-gun salute echoed through the green forest to herald the procession's arrival. Court musicians playing pipes, flutes, drum and gong led the funeral party up the gray graveled lane. Approaching the mausoleum, the hearse followed a group of attendants in black or green robes carrying shields, pikes, banners of yellow and white, and two of the evergreen sakaki trees held sacred by the Shinto religion. An official carried the white shoes. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, followed by Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, led the funeral party to a graveside funeral hall of golden Japanese cypress. A gray curtain was drawn and the coffin was placed on a cart inside the hall. Members of the family withdrew to a nearby guest house, where they spent three hours, and the coffin was pulled 100 feet up a slope to the tomb. The rites were steeped in the ritual of Shinto, the indigenous religion that preceded the introduction of Buddhism to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and still coexists with it. In both faiths, care is taken to show respect to the dead and ensure peaceful rest. Funeral ceremonies for <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, who died Jan. 7 at age 87, lasted more than 13 hours; those for his father, <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION>, in 1927 lasted 1 -LCB- days and mourners dared not even look at the ox-drawn hearse. Modern technology was used this time to speed the process: a motorized hearse instead of an ox cart for the 30-mile trip from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to the cemetery, floodlights to supplement the traditional torches and three trucks loaded with pre-mixed concrete to seal the coffin in the tomb. Offerings by court ritualists of clothing and 16 types of food, including cakes of pounded rice, oranges, rice wine and melons, ended the entombment well after dark. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> offered a sacred sakaki branch and made his final long, deep bow. <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, also offering a sakaki branch, and other members of the imperial family then paid their last respects, followed by officials. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s mound-like stone mausoleum, which will be completed in one year, sits in a quiet forest of towering cypress trees not far from the graves of his parents, <ORGANIZATION> Emperor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION> and Empress <PERSON> Teimei </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Friday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be more willing than former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was to support the idea of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a way to end apartheid. Young, who like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once served as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said that experience should make <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` more understanding and more appreciative of the powerful role that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can play in bringing about an end to apartheid.'' Young commented during an appearance on Worldnet, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s televison program in which foreign journalists question <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political figures via satellite hookups. On another subject, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a former top aide to the late civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was generally upbeat in his assessment of the prospects for blacks under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. He said there is a `` tremendous difference'' between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has worked with black leaders and the black community for years, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who `` really did not know what was going on in the black community during most of his adult life.'' Young also said the election of former <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Legislature has helped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials in general realize that their party has leaned too far to the right on race relations. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s election, he said, `` served as a warning to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that they have to make some serious efforts not to continue to be branded in the minds of most Americans as subtly and unconsciously, if not consciously, racist.''

<HEAD>GAO to Close Office in Panama Because of Unsettled Conditions There</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A congressional agency which monitors <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid programs in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> plans to close its six-person office in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> because of unsettled conditions in that country, an official said Friday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Littleton </PERSON>, director of operations for national security and international affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects all personnel will have left the office by the middle of the year. They will begin leaving shortly before presidential elections set May 7, he said. The number of official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel from various government agencies in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been scaled back considerably since 1987 when relations between the two countries began to deteriorate. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> regional office of <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which opened in 1975, oversees government-to-government aid programs for Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the humanitarian aid program for the Nicaraguan Contras as well, <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said in a telephone interview that the functions carried out by the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> office will be transferred to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize the legitimacy of the Panamanian government and has not had substantive contact with officials of that government since it assumed power a year ago. It continues to recognize as the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was deposed last February in a coup led by followers of defense chief <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. There have been numerous incidents of harassment directed against Americans, particularly military personnel, for more than a year but none has involved <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials, <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said. The military command headquarters said in a statement Wednesday that in the first six weeks of this year, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s defense forces have `` stopped, searched, rerouted, detained or impounded'' more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government vehicles than in the previous eight months. <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION> said the problems encountered by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials have been different. As an example, he said, the prohibition on contacts with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> officials has created difficulties in such areas as renewal of visas and driver's licenses. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said in congressional testimony on Tuesday that he envisions no change from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy of refusing to recognize the Noriega-led government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He added, however, that the policy is being reviewed. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted by grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on charges related to drug smuggling.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Says Interim Gov't Will Begin Operations Within
Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of an interim government for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said Friday his guerrilla-formed group would begin operations inside that country within a month, and he added: `` God willing.'' <PERSON> Sibghatullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> also asked foreign countries to recognize the proposed government, which hopes to take over if the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is overthrown. Other resistance leaders rejected the government elected by a 440-member group of Moslem guerrillas in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Thursday. At a news conference concluding the stormy three-week session, <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> said it would become functional inside <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within a month, but he did not elaborate. <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON>, leader of the guerrilla <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, also requested the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> give the interim government a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saljooque </PERSON>, a delegate and member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the whole thing -LRB- assembly -RRB- was contrived'' to leave power in the hands of a seven-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla alliance based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Eight Afghan guerrilla groups based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> boycotted the meeting in a dispute with the Pakistan-based majority over allocation of seats. `` We consider the formation of the interim government as one-sided, and we can not recognize it,'' the leader of the Iran-based rebel alliance, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalili </PERSON>, was quoted as saying Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. The guerrillas have been fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government since it seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 and completed a nine-month withdrawal Feb. 15. The guerrilla council, known as a shura, met at a religious camp outside <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> to form a broad-based interim government that would oversee a return to peace and the formation of an Islamic government. Once the shura convened on Feb. 10, the seven Pakistan-based parties quarreled over distribution of Cabinet ministries. The four fundamentalist groups favor a strict Moslem government while the moderates advocate a more liberal regime with Islam as the official religion. On Thursday, the shura approved a government that gives each of the seven leaders a key post, and reserves most remaining portfolios for their own parties. <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> on Friday repeated the guerrillas' offer of amnesty to defecting Afghan communists. `` There is a general amnesty for -LRB- <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> -RRB- regime members with the blood of mujahedeen on their hands'' if they join the resistance, <PERSON> Mojaddidi </PERSON> said through an interpreter. A Western diplomatic source in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said the rebels' announcement of a Cabinet might not be enough for the world to accept it as a new, legitimate government `` I think it's too early to talk about recognition. Their first test will be to get a capital,'' the source said, speaking on condition he not be identified. Communist forces, heavily armed by the departing <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, hold <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s key cities. The insurgents, backed mainly by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, reportedly control about 90 percent of the countryside. Guerrilla and Western observers have predicted <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will fall within weeks or months in the absence of Soviet forces but Marxist President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> says his army is strong enough to withstand a rebel onslaught. Resistance leaders say they are adopting a harrassment and siege tactic to save lives and await the communists' collapse from within. Of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s pre-war population of 15 million, more than 1 million people have died and more than 5 million Afghans live as refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met Friday with Ukrainian writers pressing for cultural, economic and environmental reforms, and participants said he expressed support for their efforts. Hours after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> left, police dragged away people who gathered near a downtown square where rallies against the <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief had been allowed nightly since Sunday, the eve of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s arrival. They hauled off anyone who stopped at October Revolution Square and put them in vans. It was not clear what happened to those who were detained. <PERSON> Dmitro </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlychko </PERSON>, head of the newly formed <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to make Ukrainian the republic's official language, said the group had a `` beautiful discussion'' with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in party leader <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>'s office. `` He completely supports all of our national, economic and ecological thoughts,'' <PERSON> Pavlychko </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> is the only remaining member of the party's ruling Politburo to have been appointed under <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, whose 18-year rule is now regarded as a period of stagnation and corruption. There have been persistent reports since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power four years ago that he has tried to oust <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>. The evening TV news program `` Vremya'' said only that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged the writers to support his reform efforts. It said he also met with top Ukrainian government and party officials as well as local party leaders before his departure for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In what likely was criticism aimed at Shcherbitsky, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the officials that in some cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> still was avoiding involvement in reform efforts. `` It is necessary to raise the intellectual level of party work, to free it from functions outside its purview,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not directly criticize <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> in the meeting, said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Drach </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> branch of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` He had to be very gentle, very delicate,'' <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> said. `` He tried to advance a line of understanding between the writers and the party.'' <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> himself called for <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>'s ouster during the meeting, he said. Russian increasingly has become the language of commerce and education since <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> assumed leadership of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> in 1972. He replaced <PERSON> Petro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelest </PERSON>, who was ousted on charges of encouraging Ukrainian nationalism. According to <PERSON> Drach </PERSON>, the writers told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> they seek an accounting of economic performance and problems, an end to massive atomic power and industrial projects they say have devastated the environment, a truthful history of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, and a revival of the Ukrainian language and culture. <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> also is the leader of the fledging <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, patterned after the unofficial political organizations that have drawn more than 100,000 members in the Baltic republics. `` We decided concrete things,'' <PERSON> Pavlychko </PERSON> said in an inteview hours after the meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He declined to elaborate. `` There was a palpable difference between <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> said. `` We could sense from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> an aura of good will.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the writers `` he would do everthing to encourage the Ukrainian language and culture'' and specifically supported calls to make Ukrainian the official language, <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> said. During the meeting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> won friends by quoting <PERSON> Taras </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON> and other Ukrainian poets, <PERSON> Pavlychko </PERSON> said. He also asked writers for patience, `` to understand the complexities of the entire situation,'' <PERSON> Pavlychko </PERSON> said. `` We should n't whip our horses,'' he quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. `` It is important that for the first time, the writers were in the office of Shcherbitsky,'' <PERSON> Drach </PERSON> said. `` We had to wait for the visit of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to get it.''

<TEXT>
 A 14-year-old boy was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> because he's a smart youngster who wants to be a criminal when he grows up, the judge who sentenced the youth said Friday. The youngster is the youngest person ever held at the prison. Buffalo County Judge <PERSON> DeWayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> decided Thursday to send <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> to the penitentiary after he was convicted as an adult of auto theft and of escaping from a state institution. `` I feel very vacant,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I sat and stared at this kid. He's a smart person. He knows what he wants, and, unfortunately, what he apparently wants is to be a criminal,'' he said. Public Defender <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON>, said the judge's only choices were to send <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kearney </LOCATION>, from which the boy escaped at least twice, or the state penitentiary. The state does not have a maximum-security facility for juvenile offenders. `` This is no normal kid,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` He's 14, but he's not the average kid from your neighborhood. He's a very dangerous young man.'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> to the center in central <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Dec. 19 after the boy was convicted of escaping from the institution. `` I gave him a lecture at that time, that he's too young to go to the penitentiary, and all that stuff,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The next day, <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> ran away from the center, which has no fences. After that escape, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> broke into some cars and stole a knife, a gun and a set of brass knuckles. The officer sent to arrest <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> in a garage asked for help, fearing for his safety, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> was later overheard to say that he would have shot the officer if he had come into the garage. <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> was sentenced to up to three years for escape and one to four years for auto theft. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> should be eligible for parole in about nine months. Assistant Corrections Director <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tewes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> was held in a hospital room at the prison. `` We could keep him there until he's 16 if we had to, but we'd rather not We'll be looking to transfer him to another state which can handle juvenile offenders,'' said <PERSON> Tewes </PERSON>, who added that <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> is the youngest person ever held at the prison. <PERSON> Boswell </PERSON> was first sent to the youth center in November 1987 for robbery, assault and burglary. `` The sad part of this real issue is what do you do with the young criminal,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` We have only two choices, YDC or corrections. We really do n't have a secure facility. We need one.'' State Sen. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chizek </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` We have to recognize that there are juveniles who are real problems, and we must deal with that,'' he said. `` We do n't have an answer right now, but I do know that sending a 14-year-old to prison is definitely not going to correct the problem.'' The problem, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said, stems from the changing nature of juvenile offenders. `` Twenty years ago they were runaways. Today they are doing the same things as adult criminals,'' <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. `` Our failure with this particular youth was some time ago, probably before he was 8. This just did n't happen overnight,'' he said.

 A judge on Friday sentenced two men to six years probation and 1,200 hours community service for stealing donated eye tissues and selling them abroad. Hillsborough Circuit Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> also fined each man $ 4,500 to cover restitution and court costs, but said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> will have a clean record if they successfully complete probation. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> were convicted last month of conspiracy and grand theft by a jury that acquitted their wives, <PERSON> Gailya </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. They could have been sent to prison for one year on the conspiracy charge and five on the grand theft count. Prosecutors accused them of misrepresenting themselves as members of a non-profit eye bank in order to gain access to cadavers in medical examiners' offices, hospitals and funeral homes. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, 45, and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 40, sent corneas taken from the corpses to research facilities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, authorities said. Many went to a Saudi Arabian hospital for a processing fee as high as $ 1,300 a pair, Assistant Hillsborough State Attorney <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said during trial. Medical examiners supplying the corneas _ the transparent tissues that cover and protect the eyeball _ assumed the tissues were going to <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tissue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but they were sold by another eye bank, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ophthalmic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> were former employees of <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> Ms. <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ophthalmic </ORGANIZATION> was set up in 1986 by Mrs. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. It was closed a year later after <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> discovered <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> were removing corneas and keeping the fees for delivering them. Defense attorneys maintained their clients simply recognized a loophole in the law, set up a legitimate eye bank, retrieved corneas that likely would have been discarded, and capitalized on the need for eye tissue in foreign countries.

 A black foster mother saw her dream go up in flames when a cross was burned in her front yard and fire later gutted her house in an all-white neighborhood. <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, 27, said it's difficult for her to trust any whites after the fires earlier this month. `` You cut my heart out and burn it up, knowing you ca n't live where you want to live,'' she said. But Crisp County Sheriff <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haralson </PERSON> said the burning of Ms. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>'s house is n't indicative of the community's racial climate. `` The majority of <LOCATION> Crisp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents do n't condone'' what happened to Ms. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, the sheriff said. Ms. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> had moved into the house in a subdivision just north of <LOCATION> Cordele </LOCATION> Feb. 12, having signed a $ 315-a-month lease with an option to buy at $ 28,000. She receives about $ 1,100 a month in state assistance for caring for five foster children. She has one child of her own. But before she could spend a night in her dream house, someone burned an 8-foot-high cross on the lawn. `` The cross meant they were going to burn me down,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> said. So, she repacked and moved in with her sister. Two days later, authorities said, fire gutted the house. No arrests have been made. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Perry </LOCATION>, said Friday that authorities did not believe the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> was involved. `` We're looking at some individuals,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, declining to comment on whether any were residents of the subdivision. `` There's been nothing to suggest'' that the Klan was involved `` other than the fact that a wooden cross was burned,'' he said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Crisp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chapter, said the organization has not become involved in the incident and is awaiting the outcome of the investigation. `` This is the first incident of this nature in several years,'' he said. `` That's what's so upsetting about it.'' <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON>, 31, and his wife and 9-year-old son live across the street from Ms. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>'s former house. His fence company, he said, does business with blacks and he does n't object to blacks living in the neighborhood. `` I do n't care where they live, but I do n't want to eat with them,'' <PERSON> Amerson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> H.M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who leased the house to Ms. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, declined to discuss the fire. Ms. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> is leasing another house from <LOCATION> Turton </LOCATION> in a mixed neighborhood.

<HEAD>Psychologists Say Elderly Being Excessively Medicated</HEAD>

 The nation's elderly are being `` needlessly and inhumanely'' drugged by doctors who are inexperienced in treating older patients and who rely on drugs to control behavior, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Many of these patients could benefit from lower doses of the medications they need to treat chronic illnesses and from alternative, nondrug therapies such as psychological counseling, the association said in asking Medicare to cover their services. Too often the elderly are `` needlessly and inhumanely being left and psychologically abandoned to drug-induced stupors,'' said <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, executive director of professional practice at the association. He spoke to reporters at a briefing in advance of a forum sponsored by the association's board of professional affairs on the overuse and misuse of prescription drugs for the elderly. A report earlier this month by the inspector general's office at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> alleged widespread prescription drug problems among the elderly. The report said Americans over age 60 account for 51 percent of deaths and 39 percent of hospitalizations from drug reactions. The psychologists' association concentrated on the misprescribing of psychotropic drugs _ medications that control behavior _ to older patients. `` Antipsychotic drugs must be used appropriately, for specific documentable reasons, not simply to control behavior, perhaps more for staff convenience'' at nursing homes, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON>, associate professor of pharmacy at <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who joined <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> at the briefing. `` The tragic scenario of a physically robust patient turning into a nonfunctional zombie after receiving antipsychotics has been played out many times,'' he said. The problem may be eased, he said, by Medicare regulations due to go into effect later this year. The rules will require nursing homes to ensure that residents are not given antipsychotic drugs unless needed to treat a specific condition and that residents who use the drugs be given gradual dose reductions or drug `` holidays'' when possible in an effort to discontinue use. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than 8,000 nursing homes, noted that `` government standards for care currently discourage the use of drug therapy to control behavior.'' She added, `` While we recognize that psychotropic drugs have been used in the past as chemical restraints, physicians prescribing drugs to nursing home patients increasingly realize that such practices may help control behavior but they inevitably create new problems.'' From 35 percent to 40 percent of prescribed sedatives and hypnotic drugs go to elderly Americans, who make up about 12 percent of the population, the psychologists' group said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatristric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> agrees that physicians need more training about prescribing psychotropic drugs for the elderly. The association started such a program two years ago, said spokesman Dr. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> said it is `` naive'' for the psychologists to believe that many nursing home patients could be treated with alternative, nonmedical therapies. He said 60 percent to 70 percent of nursing home patients have some form of dementia and most would not benefit from behavior modification. The psychologists recommend that the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program, the federal health insurance program for the elderly, be expanded to cover psychological services. Currently, the program's mental health coverage includes services by psychiatrists, who can prescribe drugs. The services of psychologists, who are not medical doctors and can not prescribe drugs, are not covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Simonson </PERSON>, who specializes in geriatric pharmacology, said medications to control behavior can be used effectively to manage patients, and in nursing homes there is often pressure to use these drugs to control patients prone to wandering around, yelling or striking out at other patients.

 A veteran sheriff's deputy who allegedly was smoking cocaine with a prostitute was arrested for investigation of murdering three hookers in an area where at least nine prostitutes have been killed, police said Friday. <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, 40, a narcotics investigator who has been with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Department for 18 years, was spotted with the woman in his car early Thursday by police officers patrolling south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said at a news conference. Police have been investigating the slayings in the area of at least nine and possibly as many as a dozen `` strawberries,'' women who trade sex for drugs, since August 1985. Police were investigating whether <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was linked to the other recent slayings, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. But he said there was no indication the deputy was linked to any of another series of prostitute killings in the area earlier this decade that became known collectively as the South Side slayings. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was arrested after a gun found in his car was linked by a ballistics test to the three killings, police said. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said the woman in the car did not know <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was a deputy. `` He did not stop her using his badge,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` He only identified himself -LRB- as a deputy -RRB- after the officers stopped him.'' The name of the woman in the car with <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was not released. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said officers determined that she was a prostitute, but he would not characterize her as a `` strawberry.'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said she told officers that she was getting scared before the officers stopped them because she had been `` well briefed'' by police on the killings. The woman told investigators `` simply that he -LRB- <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> -RRB- wanted to go to the trunk of his vehicle,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. The gun was found in the trunk. The gun was not described but <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said it was not the deputy's service weapon. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> waived his rights and spoke to investigators, but the chief would only reveal a little bit of what was said. `` He was not able to explain all of this,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. `` He admitted he picked up the young woman but he did not believe she was a prostitute.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, married with two children ages 20 and 5, had been assigned to a unit at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` He has a very fine record,'' <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said. `` He has been a very effective investigator in the narcotics bureau.'' Police on routine patrol spotted <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>' car parked, but said it pulled away from the curb in an `` erratic'' manner when they approached and the officers made a traffic stop, the chief said. The officers believed <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was under the influence of an intoxicating substance. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said the woman told investigators they had been smoking cocaine, but he noted that tests were still being conducted to confirm the type of substance. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> was initially held for driving under the influence. After the ballistics report on the three killings was finished, he was arrested in his home in <LOCATION> Rialto </LOCATION>, about 55 miles east of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. A search warrant was obtained and the home was searched but <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> would not reveal what was recovered there. `` We have ballistic matches on three homicides and three only,'' <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> said. Those three victims were found on Oct. 14, Nov. 18 and Dec. 11.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Says Europe 1992 Should Be Good for U.S. Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s plan to create a unified economy by 1992 is expected to expand markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies rather than create a `` fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' that shuns <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, in his first major address since joining the Cabinet, said that while there are sure to be a few European `` strongholds'' against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods, the initiative generally is likely to improve business opportunities for Americans. The 12 countries in the European Economic Community are trying to forge a single market, almost as integrated as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by the end of 1992. `` In a sense, 1992 marks a shift in majority view away from protection and toward openness _ a willingness to gamble that this openness will work,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said at a congressionally sponsored conference on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1992. He said government analysts and business executives also are concerned that some benefits of the unified market may be denied to non-EEC countries, but the full impact of the initiative wo n't be known until the plan actually is implemented. `` The reality is that many Europeans are not completely in favor of more open markets,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said. `` Some European companies have been accustomed to having their inefficiency shielded by their governments.'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said that while free-trade advocates can not expect to win every dispute, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will work to eliminate any inequities. `` All of us in the administration will forcefully advocate vital <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business interests through regular meetings with our <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> counterparts,'' he said. Speaking about efforts to shrink the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said he had a message for countries that think they can continue to sell to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> while refusing to buy American products: `` Those days are over.'' `` An open <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is best for us and for the world,'' he said. `` But the world must be open to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as well.'' In addition, <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said, American industry must redouble its investment, research and pursuit of quality in order to better compete with foreign producers. `` American industry must learn to do what others do, and pull out all stops to win and hold foreign customers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israeli Soldier Killed, Nine Palestinians Reported Wounded</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve soldier was killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Friday when Palestinians dropped a cement block on his head from the roof of a building, the army said. The soldier, identified as <PERSON> Binyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>, 24, was the sixth member of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s armed forces to be killed since the uprising began in December 1987. A total of 17 Israelis and at least 385 Palestinians have been killed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and television said <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> provoked soldiers by throwing stones and lured them into one of the narrow alleys of the city's open air market. The large block was then dropped and hit <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON>, who was wearing a steel helmet. After <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> was hit, troops opened fire, said a <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> army commander who was not identified further. The army imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' 120,000 residents and began house-to-house searches, and sporadic gunfire was heard, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, nine Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. The hospital officials said the wounded included a 30-year-old woman who was nine months pregnant. Doctors said she was shot in the back but was not in serious condition. They said a 4-year-old boy was shot in the right arm. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s political adviser, said in an interview published Friday he was trying to arrange a meeting with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, speaking in an interview with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said he was `` working through British political figures in the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to arrange a meeting with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> who will visit <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' `` If I meet him I will ask him ` Why do you shoot children'?'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. `` He will of course ask me, ` Why are you rioting'?'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has met extensively with Palestinian officials in the occupied lands, but, in line with government policy, has said he would not negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has left for a fund-raising tour in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and was scheduled to go to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> next week, said a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Recent polls have indicated the majority of Israelis support negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> under certain conditions. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Friday reiterated his opposition to talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, saying the organization was still intent on destroying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also rejected a demand by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agree to talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference as the price of renewing diplomatic ties. `` We will not accept any conditions for the resumption of relations,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told a news conference after a three-day visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` As long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> does n't renew ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, from our view it can not be involved in any way in the peace process in the region.'' The statement appeared to contradict an earlier one by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> who said after a meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> he believed the Soviets could play a role in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peacemaking even without diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Investigation Under Way Into Arson Fire; Programs Continue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It will take more than theft of computers, rifling of files and a six-alarm arson fire to put the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> out of business, its president said Friday as operations continued at temporary quarters. `` If it were the arsonist's intentions to halt our work, it did n't happen,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON>. The alliance operates several outreach programs, including the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that also was housed in the destroyed building. Damage caused by the fire in a strip shopping center was estimated at $ 750,000, said fire Capt. J.E. Foster. No injuries were reported. `` The fire set us back an hour, that's how much they halted our service to the gay community and to people with AIDS,'' he said. `` We deal with AIDS day in and day out. Believe me, a fire we can handle.'' Investigators ruled the center was set afire early Thursday after its offices were ransacked and computers and legal documents were stolen. Arson investigators said they had no suspects. Two other businesses also were destroyed. No confidential information about AIDS clients was taken, <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON> said. `` Those files wo n't mean anything to anybody except us,'' he said. `` We've always been an open organization. They could have gotten the same information just by calling us.'' Missing documents included papers concerning efforts to have state district Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> removed from office, <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> offices had been a center of activity for attempts to oust <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> since December, when he was quoted in a newspaper article as saying he gave a lighter sentence to a killer because his two victims were homosexuals. Arson investigators suspect a petroleum product may have been used to ignite the fire becaue of the intense heat it generated, fire officials said. Results of laboratory rests were expected Monday. <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON> said all of the alliance's services continued Friday thanks to community support, including donations of equipment and furniture. He said an electronic security alarm system and 24-hour security guards also were donanted. <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON> also said a new weekly program of low-cost anonymous AIDS tests was launched Thursday as planned, albeit to a lower number than expected. `` We only had a few people come by for it,'' <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON> said. `` But I think that's because of all the TV cameras _ that makes it hard to be anonymous.'' The three missing computers contained information about the alliance's activities, including lists of donors and organization members. Alliance leaders said the missing materials could not be used to identify any clients, including those with AIDS. <PERSON> Waybourn </PERSON> said the center had some insurance `` but not enough to cover our losses. It's hard to get coverage on a facility like ours.''

<HEAD>Narrow Conservative Victory Points to Thatcher Disapproval</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> narrowly retained one of its safest parliamentary seats Friday against a strong show of voter disapproval of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s policies. The special election in the wealthy <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> district in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> saw the Tory majority tumble from nearly 20,000 votes to 2,600, saved from defeat only by a split centrist vote. It was the biggest collapse of Conservative support since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came to power in 1979. The main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which earlier Friday kept its seat at <LOCATION> Pontypridd </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> in another by-election, was beaten into fourth place in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. The elections to fill vacant seats in the 650-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> came midway through Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s third term, with polls showing a sharp dro in Tory support and increased backing for Labor. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> voters appeared to reflect the widespread hostility to government plans to reform the state-funded <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and privatize the country's water companies, and to the recent upsurge in inflation. `` There has been something of a protest vote against the government,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hague </PERSON>, 27, the victorious Conservative candidate in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. `` We have had problems on the issue of health reforms and on the proposed privatization of water. We still have a lot of convincing to do.'' The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> election had been watched closely to see which of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two feuding centrist parties _ <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s splinter Social Democrats or <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>'s larger, newly merged <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> _ would poll more votes. The Social Democrats did by a wide margin, and <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> called it `` a stunning result ... -LRB- which -RRB- shows that sticking with your beliefs pays off in British politics.'' The results gave Hague 19,543 votes; Social Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> 16,909; <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> Democrat <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> 11,589; and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> 2,591. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> said the results showed their parties should try to unite behind a single candidate before the next general election, which Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> must call by June 1992. In Pontypridd, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Howells </PERSON>, 42, a research officer with the left-led <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineworkers </ORGANIZATION>, won 20,549 votes or 53.3 percent. Second-place went to the Plaid Cymru Welsh nationalist candidate, <PERSON> Syd </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, with 9,755 votes or 25.3 percent. Plaid Cymru, with three seats in the 650-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, seeks independence for <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tory </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> trailed with 5,212 votes or 13.5 percent. Pontypridd is a Labor stronghold in the once thriving but now largely neglected industrial heartland of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Howells </PERSON>' victory was predictable Labor has lost three consecutive general elections to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> since 1979. Party leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> is trying to edge Labor away from some of its hard-line socialist doctrines and soften its advocacy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. Labor has gained in the polls because of discontent with <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> policies, especially the government's plans for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which many voters see as a first step toward a mainly private system. The service will remain free to patients but hospitals will compete with each other for fees of state-funded patients and for private patients. The elderly will get tax breaks for buying private health insurance. The Pontypridd election was caused by the death of local Labor legislator <PERSON> Brynmor </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> election was called following the appointment of the Conservative incumbent, Sir <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittan </PERSON>, to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s executive commission.

<HEAD>Videotape Details Laurie Dann's Last Day: Arson, Gunfire and Poison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNETKA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A videotape that recreates <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s last day _ a nightmare of deadly gunfire at an elementary school, arson, poison and suicide _ helps spare Police Chief <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> the strain of retelling the grim story `` But it also brings back memories. It makes it as vivid as when I was there,'' said <PERSON> Timm </PERSON>, who is using the video in presentations on the deadly events of last May 20 to law enforcement, social work and community groups. `` We started getting so many requests, we decided to make a video that might stand on its own,'' <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said Friday. `` Community Crisis: The <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> Case'' recreates <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s violent rampage in this comfortable north <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, 30, opened fire in a second-grade classroom at <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> elementary school, killing one student and wounding five She then ran to a nearby home and wounded a college student before killing herself. The video recounts the events beginning at 10:20 a.m., when the city's <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> received its first call about a fire in the house where <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> babysat, to 7:20 p.m., when police found her dead. Police later found evidence she had attempted to set fires and deliver poison snacks and drinks before the school shootings. The video includes <PERSON> Timm </PERSON>'s estimate that if <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> had killed everyone she tried to burn, poison and shoot that day, the death toll would have been 50 instead of two _ an 8-year-old boy and <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> herself _ and six wounded. `` Every time I see it, tears come to my eyes,'' <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> said. The video also includes the chief's candid admission that reporters' questions helped shape police strategy. `` They would ask ... ` Chief, how about this? Chief, how about that?' And I would say, ` Well, we're working on that, we're looking into it,''' <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> recalled on the video. `` Then I'd race back into the building and say ... ` My God, have you guys thought about looking into this?''' Survivors or victims' families were not interviewed, said independent producer <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who donated his hourlong, $ 50,000 production to this village of about 13,000. `` We tried very hard not to be sensationalistic or to exploit anyone,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` I wanted people to learn.'' The camera bursts into the bathroom where one boy was shot and moves into a second-grade classroom, where the woman's gunfire killed <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> and wounded four other children. Still photographs capture the aftermath of bloody clothing, a bloody floor. Stark photographs of <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>'s body, face down on a carpet, mark the end of the daylong assault, though <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said he debated over using them. `` For a storyteller, it had a finality to it that was hard to overlook,'' said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who lives in neighboring <LOCATION> Kenilworth </LOCATION> and produces education film and videotapes. <PERSON> Timm </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> to help with the video project after the two met while working together with parents concerned about drug and alcohol abuse. The tape sells for $ 450 and rents for $ 100. Any profits will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Winnetka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It showed us there are some things we did wrong _ we had problems with command posts -LRB- in the right place -RRB- and problems with communication when calls from reporters and families saturated our phone lines,'' <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> said. The video brings back tragic memories for him, too. `` But if it's going to help someone in the future,'' <PERSON> Sumner </PERSON> added, `` it's worth the pain.''

The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the talks were held at <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s resort home in the southern city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, which was devastated by Iranian attacks during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> handed <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> a message from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during the three-hour meeting, the agency reported. It did not disclose the contents. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> also attended the meeting. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, the agency said, told <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` was opposed to efforts to freeze the Iran-Iraq conflict and maintain the present no-war, no-peace situation.'' <PERSON> Shevarnadze </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` respects the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> stand and its determination to work for a settlement of the conflict,'' the agency said. A U.N.-mediated cease-fire halted the war Aug. 20. But peace talks that began five days later have been deadlocked over troop withdrawals. Upon arriving Thursday in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the fourth stop on his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he was concerned about lack of progress in the peace negotiations. He will be in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Saturday, where he has been granted a rare audience with <LOCATION> Iranain </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. Eastern diplomats here said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> would press <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and Iranian leaders to work toward a peace treaty in the negotiations being conducted under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s major weapons supplier and one of its key trade partners, is believed to have supplied <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with billions of dollars worth of goods on credit during the gulf war. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> also touched on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> news agency said. The two hailed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s peace overtures and agreed to work to `` activate a serious initiative that would lead to peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' the news agency reported. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, where he said Thursday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must agree to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and accept an international peace conference as the price of resuming full diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said relations must come before an expanded Soviet role in peace negotiations. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met separately with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposes a U.N.-organized peace conference but has said it would go to one under the auspices of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Israelis, however, vow never to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which they accuse of being a terrorist organization.

 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday paid the $ 465 million settlement ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> gas leak. The court also began hearing a petition asking the settlement be raised to $ 600 million. The <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based company made its payment four weeks ahead of the deadline imposed by the court. The Indian government has a week to submit to the court a breakdown of how the funds will be allotted. On Wednesday, the Association for <ORGANIZATION> Socio-Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literacy </ORGANIZATION> submitted a petition asking that compensation for the 1984 disaster, which killed more than 3,400 people, be increased to $ 600 million. A same five-judge <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> panel that ordered the first settlement began preliminary hearings Friday on the petition. <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garg </PERSON>, an attorney for the group, has argued the settlement `` challenged the concept of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as a free nation'' by `` capitulating'' to <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> and had `` fettered its fine Constitution to the whims of a multinational company.'' Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> refused comment on the petition. The government says 20,000 people were seriously affected by exposure to the methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> pesticide plant operated the Indian subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>. On Feb. 14, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 470 million in final settlement of all claims. However, the court ruled last week that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> could receive credit for $ 5 million deposited after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> ruled in 1986 that the money be made available for immediate relief to the victims. Opposition politicians and gas victims have denounced the settlement as too low. The Indian government originally sued <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion.

<HEAD>Brazilian Indians Demand Suspension of Amazon Dam</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALTAMIRA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chiefs of <PERSON> Amazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes ended a historic meeting Friday with a demand to stop plans to build a hydroelectric dam that would flood native lands. Hundreds of Indians, wearing colored feathers, beads and red and black paint, stood and chanted their support as Indian leader <PERSON> Ailton </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenac </PERSON> read an appeal to protect <LOCATION> Amazonia </LOCATION>, home to most of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 220,000 native people `` We do not want the construction of dams on the <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and on other rivers in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>, because they threaten Indian nations,'' he said. The mostly white audience of townspeople and representatives of environmental groups cheered and applauded. More than 500 Indians from about 40 native groups met for five days in this eastern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> city, 2,000 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, to protest the proposed <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> tributary. It was the first time Indians in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> set aside longstanding tribal rivalries and banded together in a political movement. The reservoir of the $ 5.8 billion dam would flood 500 square miles of rain forest. The dam would have a generating capacity of 11 million kilowatts _ 40 percent more than that of Grand Coulee, the biggest hydroelectric dam in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` For a long time, the white man has ignored our thinking and the spirit of our ancestors. Now this must stop. Our territory is the sacred site of our people, the home of our creator that can not be violated,'' <PERSON> Krenac </PERSON> said. The government contends <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> must tap the vast hydroelectric potential of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin to progress. Federal electric power officials at the gathering told the Indians that dams will be built. Earlier in the week, one Indian woman thrust a machete just inches from the face of an electricity company representative. Other tribal people said that was merely a symbolic gesture. Congressman <PERSON> Tadeu </PERSON> <PERSON> Franca </PERSON>, pledged to carry on the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' fight in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital. `` Because of this meeting, it will be Indians, working together _ not some presidential decree _ that will build the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' history,'' he said. `` Nothing like this has ever happened before. The Indians will go back to their villages with the sense that something really new and important has happened,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anthropologist who has worked more than 20 years with the <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indians </LOCATION>. Construction of the dam is scheduled to start in 1993. It must first be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has shown interest in getting partial financing for the project from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, but Indians and environmental groups are asking the Washington-based institution not to put up any money. In a small victory this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> won an agreement from the government electric power company in <LOCATION> Amazonia </LOCATION> to change the name of the project to <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Kararao </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kararao </PERSON> is a war cry of the <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> tribe and was offensive to other tribes.

<HEAD>Couple Won't Seek Custody Of Child They Think Was Swapped At Birth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A couple wo n't seek custody of a 10-year-old girl they believe is their daughter, but they still want genetic testing done to determine whether they are her real parents, their lawyer said Friday. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, would settle for a chance to visit with the girl, and make her part of their family, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>' attorney. `` They were becoming very frustrated with the public's perception They have always intended to do what is best for everyone,'' said <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>. The Twiggs filed a lawsuit last year seeking genetic testing of the girl, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>. The girl's father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, a roofing supply salesman from <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, is fighting to block the tests. The Twiggs claim they brought the wrong child home from <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> in 1978, and that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> took their child the same day. The girl the Twiggs raised, named <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, died of a congenital heart defect last August. They learned through blood tests that she was not their daughter. <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> were the only two white baby girls in the hospital at the same time. The <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, who maintain hospital personnel deliberately switched their healthy daughter for a sickly child, have asked a <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> court to order genetic testing to determine <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s parentage. `` This does n't change the lawsuit at all,'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said. In December, <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> inscribed a drawing she gave him for Christmas: `` I hate the Twiggs. I want them to go away.'' <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, died of cancer in 1981. He remarried and later divorced. Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> said she and her husband first considered seeking custody because they suspected <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> participated in the alleged baby swap, but now there is no evidence to support that. The <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON>, who have seven children, later grew concerned about public sentiment that they were being unfair to <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>. They say they have received hate mail comparing them to terrorists. `` You take a step back and say, ` What is in the best interest of everybody involved?''' Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published in Friday editions, breaking four months of silence in the case. `` We feel that we should not be denied the right to know that girl as a child.'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said while there have been no discussions with <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> or his attorney, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, the Twiggs should be the ones to determine extent of the visitation, relying on guidance from psychologists and psychiatrists. `` I think the only basis the Twiggs would seek custody is if some professional told them it would be in <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s best interest to remove her from Mr. <PERSON> May </PERSON>'s house, which we do not anticipate,'' said <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> was not available Friday, his office said. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> could not be reached; he has an unpublished telephone number.

 A West German businessman who was convicted of illegally re-exporting a chemical warfare ingredient to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been denied all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export privileges for 10 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walaschek </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> last August after pleading guilty to illegally re-exporting U.S.-made thiodiglycol from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in violation of the Export Administration Act, the department said.

 A third associate of <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> appeared in court Friday in connection with the slaying of a 14-year-old activist who allegedly was assaulted at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s house <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 61, appeared briefly in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> Magistrate's Court Authorities have identified him as the bus driver for Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s unofficial bodyguards, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> soccer club. On Tuesday, the self-described coach of <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, and a 17-year-old club member were arraigned in court on charges of murdering activist <PERSON> Stompie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, 14. They were arrested Sunday at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is the wife of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the jailed chief of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the largest group fighting the white-dominated government. Last week, major anti-apartheid groups accused <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> members of conducting a `` reign of terror'' in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and said Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> should be ostracized. The groups stressed that they remained loyal to <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>'s appearance in court Friday was procedural and did not deal with the substance of the case against him, officials said. News of the appearance was the first disclosure <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> had been arrested. <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>, whose funeral is scheduled for Saturday, allegedly was abducted in late December along with three other young men, taken to Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home and assaulted. <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>'s decomposed body was found in a field on Jan. 7 and was identified by forensic experts two weeks ago. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> summoned three prominent anti-apartheid lawyers for a four-hour meeting Thursday at <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Verster </PERSON> prison farm near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, but details of the discussions have not been disclosed. <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON>'s murder is one of four recent killings involving people connected directly or indirectly to Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and her bodyguards. On Wednesday, a 13-year-old Soweto girl was killed when gunmen fired on her house with AK-47 rifles and set the dwelling on fire with a firebomb. Police said the attack might have been in revenge for the killing last week of <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Madondo </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, Dr. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON>, a physician and activist, was shot and killed at his <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> clinic. A suspect has confessed to shooting <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON> during a robbery attempt, and police say the case is non-political. But Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has suggested that <PERSON> Asvat </PERSON> may have been killed because he had examined <PERSON> Seipei </PERSON> and other youths she said were sexually molested by a Methodist minister. Methodist leaders have denied the sex allegations and accused Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> of falsely implying that the church conspired with police to discredit her. The <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a committee of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> activists have suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> was infiltrated by police agents, but these groups have criticized Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for poor judgment and lack of discipline. In another development, anti-apartheid leaders criticized the government for not releasing more detainees following negotiations to end a hunger strike. Nearly 300 black detainees in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Port </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> suspended a three-week hunger strike last week after Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> told anti-apartheid church leaders that a `` substantial number'' of detainees would be released within two weeks. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sash </ORGANIZATION> civil rights group, told a news conference held by several activists that only 17 detainees had been released. `` This is not a substantial number of detainees, and does not enable us to report to the hunger strikers that their suffering and their agreement to suspend the strike have been vindicated,'' she said. Many of the detainees have been held for more than two years without charges, and they are demanding that they either be charged or released.

 A military jury reprimanded a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain Friday for not giving enough help to a boatload of Vietnamese refugees who resorted to cannibalism to survive. The jury of six <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captains could have jailed <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, a decorated <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war veteran, for 90 days and made him forfeit two-thirds of his pay for three months. It said he erred in handling the situation that arose last June 9 while his ship was in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> but deserved no further punishment than being relieved of command, as he was in August. He was acquitted of the more serious charge of ordering one refugee shaken off ropes as the man tried to climb aboard the amphibious landing ship USS Dubuque. <PERSON> Balian </PERSON>, 48, claimed he was made a scapegoat and said, `` Heroes like me are hung out to dry when they get in trouble.'' He was charged with failing to render adequate assistance to more than 80 Vietnamese refugees in a leaky boat the <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION> encountered about 250 miles north of the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Palawan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said 31 refugees later died and survivors said they had eaten the flesh of the dead before Filipino fishermen rescued them June 27.

 Leftist guerrillas made the second charge in as many days Friday that the army attacked one of their field hospitals. The report said one person was killed and another wounded. The armed forces denied both allegations. Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said soldiers used light artillery and small arms in an attack Feb. 18 on a field hospital near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vicente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION>, about 40 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. On Thursday, the Legal Aid Office of the Roman Catholic church said 10 people were slain in an army attack Feb. 13 on a rebel field hospital. A `` brigadista'' was killed in the attack last Saturday and a patient was wounded, <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that soldiers `` stole and destroyed all hospital supplies and medicines.'' The report did not identify the `` brigadista,'' a term often used for armed paramedics. Col. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, denied the Radio Venceremos report. `` What's happening is that the rebels are trying to continue with the line that we are violators of human rights and of the Geneva Convention'' on human rights, he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said `` there normally are n't hospitals'' in the area of the alleged attack `` because there is constant combat and military units constantly force the guerrillas to move on.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday two of those killed in the Feb. 13 attack in the northern province of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> _ a woman doctor and a 14-year-old girl _ may have been raped. Venceremos claimed Feb. 15 that soldiers of the Atlacatl Battalion attacked and destroyed the field hospital two days earlier. It said three medical workers and three guerrilla patients were killed. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and rebel radio identified the possible rape victims as <PERSON> Alejandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, a 35-year-old Mexican doctor, and <PERSON> Rosibel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubon </PERSON>, a paramedic's aide. Their bodies were exhumed and examined Feb. 17 by the representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, a respected human rights organization. Legal Aid said five wounded guerrillas and three other medical aides also were killed at the hospital outside <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Encuentros </LOCATION> village near the <LOCATION> Sumpul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which forms <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, military commander of <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province, told reporters Thursday there was no field hospital near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Encuentros </LOCATION>. He said Atlacatl soldiers killed several guerrillas, including the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> doctor, in combat Feb. 13. Legal Aid concluded that a field hospital was set up near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Encuentros </LOCATION> and Atlacatl troops `` attacked and destroyed the field hospital and killed war wounded and the medical personnel present.'' It called the attack `` a flagrant violation'' of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s constitution and the 1949 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Conventions, to which <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is a signatory

<HEAD>Regulators Reject Charge that Policies Discourage Third World Debt
Forgiveness</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal bank regulators, in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> released Friday, rejected charges that their policies discourage banks from forgiving part of the huge debt owed by Third World countries. `` Current regulatory policy and accounting policies have not prevented banks, that were otherwise inclined to do so, from participating in a wide range of negotiated debt reduction transactions with borrowing countries,'' three regulatory agencies said in a report to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Critics of current policy say banks are discouraged from realistically recognizing losses on Third World debt. They say banks should be permitted to spread the effects of recognizing losses over several years. Currently, they must reduce their profit by the full amount of any addition to loss reserves. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said accounting standards are designed to present a true picture of banks' financial condition, adding, `` accounting policies ... are not intended to encourage or discourage any actions that management considers to be in the best interest of the institution.'' They cited <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> estimates showing that $ 20 billion in developing country debt has been eliminated in the past two years. The three agencies also said that banks' exposure to developing country debt had improved considerably since the crisis first emerged in 1982 but was still large for the nation's 10 biggest banks. At the end of September, the 10 largest banks were on the hook to developing countries for loans representing 95 percent of the banks' capital and loss reserves And, the report endorsed the continuation of the so-called <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan, which rejects taxpayer contributions toward solving the problem and encourages case-by-case negotiations for additional lending rather than any coordinated plan of debt forgiveness. The approach is named after Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who developed while serving as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. `` The bank regulatory agencies continue to believe the case-by-case negotiated approach is the best method,'' the report said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said his administration will take a new look at the approach, but has advocated no specific changes. On another point, the report said the secondary market for selling and swapping Third World loans is a poor indicator of the loans' true value. Many analysts say they are worried because the loans are now worth about 40 percent of their original value, down from 60 percent in mid-1987. The regulators said secondary market prices may reflect short-term supply and demand rather than the long-term value of the loans. The regulators' report is the first installment toward meeting the requirements of a section of last year's trade act. A second report, due by May 31, will examine the effects of Third World lending on bank profits between 1977 and 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was supposed to deliver another report this week on new approaches for solving the debt crisis, but was given a three-week extension.

<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> refused to work on Friday to protest ethnic discrimination and to demand the resignation of a provincial <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief. <ORGANIZATION> Yugoslav </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> descended a mine shaft to meet with miners who began the strike Monday, but they reportedly told another official that `` you can have us out only in our coffins.'' The state-run media said 40,000 people have staged sympathy strikes across <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, a province of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, one of six Yugoslav republics. Schools, universities and most businesses closed Friday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency described the province as `` on the verge of a general strike and total paralysis.'' Suvar and Serbian party boss <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> rushed to <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the provincial capital, to prevent possible ethnic clashes between <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Albanian majority and the Slav minority. `` The crisis has reached critical point,'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said at a meeting in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the provincial capital. `` We must stop at all cost the worsening of the situation.'' The protesters condemn <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s drive to secure greater control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> by changing the current constitution, fearing they would lose wide autonomy granted to them in 1974. They also demand the resignation of provincial party leader <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Morina </PERSON>, who they consider an ally of <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. Serbian leaders have asserted that they must have more control in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to protect the mainly <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Slav </PERSON> minority allegedly persecuted by predominantly Moslem ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON>, who make up 85 percent of the province's population. President <PERSON> Raif </PERSON> <PERSON> Dizdarevic </PERSON> said he would `` take all measures under the constitution and laws'' to prevent `` violations of order and peace and thhreats to the constitutional system.'' Foreigners traveling to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> noticed an unuusally large number of police, an indication that units were sent to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. There was no official confirmation. More than 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners, some on a hunger strike, have refused to leave their pits at the <LOCATION> Trepca </LOCATION> mines. Later Friday, <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> met with the <LOCATION> Trepca </LOCATION> mine's management and said that `` nobody, not even the miners, have a right to issue political ultimatums to the country.'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, who spent three hours with the striking miners, left the <LOCATION> Trepca </LOCATION> mine without any apparent result. He would not comment on the meeting. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> was told by <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrasi </PERSON>, the director of the mine, that the miners have told him `` you can have us out only in our coffins.'' About 250 miners have asked for medical aid, said Dr. <PERSON> Nedjmi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeciri </PERSON>, the mine's medical officer. Six were hospitalized for exhaustion, while the rest received treatement at the makeshift first aid station outside the mine, he said. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> on Friday reiterated his stand by saying in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> that `` Albanian nationalism'' has caused `` physical, political and cultural violence over'' Slavs in the province, `` which is unprecedented in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today.'' In November, up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> for five days to protest the dismissal of senior provincial officials as demanded by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s leaders.

 A young Lebanese radical was convicted and sentenced to life in prison Friday for the 1987 hijacking of a jetliner and the murder of a French passenger. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s highest court branded <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, 22, a political fanatic whose actions were `` especially despicable and cold-blooded.'' <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> single-handedly commandeered an Air Afrique DC-10 flying from <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on July 24, 1987. He demanded the release of Lebanese and Palestinians held by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> asked to be flown to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> but agreed to a refueling stop in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where he shot passenger <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaulieu </PERSON>, 28, when his deadline for refueling the plane expired. The five-member <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which convenes only in cases of `` particular gravity,'' convicted <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> on all seven counts against him, including murder, attempted murder and hostage taking. The bearded <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem whom prosecutors called a `` killer blinded by conviction,'' listened impassively as chief judge <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Leu </PERSON> read the sentence. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>'s father said tearfully he had expected his son would get a severe sentence, but not life. `` I can not do anything now. I wish I could visit him in jail, but I do not have the money to buy an air ticket to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, 61, said in <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> <PERSON> Qanaoun </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahr </PERSON>, near the southern port of Tyre. `` I do not want to talk about my son. Nobody is with him and no one can help him,'' his mother, <PERSON> Felleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> said at the family residence ajacent to the grocery shop they own. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> will be eligible for parole after 15 years. He was also ordered to pay $ 657,000 in damages, mostly to Air Afrique. During the five-day trial, <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> told the court he was a `` soldier of God'' and did not want to kill. He refused to testify about allegations he was on a mission for the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> group, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most militant faction. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> reportedly told interrogators before the trial he joined <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 after his release from an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prison. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding most of the 15 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Investigators said <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> boarded the plane at <LOCATION> Bangui </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, carrying a pistol, 140 rounds of ammunition and explosives. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> said he bribed his way around security checks. Swiss police stormed the hijacked jet and arrested <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> after crew members overpowered him and passengers began fleeing in safety chutes. A flight attendant was shot and seriously injured when he jumped <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>'s demands included the release of the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brothers, two Lebanese arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as terror suspects. One of them, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, has been on trial in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> since July on charges linked to the 1985 hijack of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed and 39 Americans held hostage for 17 days. The other <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was convicted by a West German court of arranging the kidnapping of two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to win freedom for his brother. The West Germans have since been freed. When a <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegate was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last November, <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> foreign minister <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Felber </PERSON> said the abduction was aimed gaining leniency for <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>. The envoy of the all-Swiss <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, was released after a month in the hands of captors who were never identified. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> said no concessions were made.

 A man who shuttled between <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified Friday that <PERSON> North </PERSON> gave Nicaraguan rebels tactical advice after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid and once suggested the Contras mount a suicide air raid on the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, 35, said at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s Iran-Contra trial that he made so many trips ferrying information between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leaders that he signed memos with the initials `` T.C.,'' meaning `` the courier.'' Despite their extensive dealings, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified, <PERSON> North </PERSON> told him he had told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the two had only a passing relationship. `` To my best recollection he said he met me a couple of times, he said, ` I met you a couple of times. I knew you were an activist supporting the Nicaraguan resistance,''' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> North </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> told jurors he actually met with <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> 80 to 100 times between July 1983 and August 1984 on Contra matters. Among the charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON> is an accusation he lied to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee by saying he had only casual contact with <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. On at least three occasions, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said, he carried maps and photographs from North to Nicaraguan rebel leaders at meetings in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, including one in November 1984. The documents he carried showed details of the airport in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital, and also included details of terrain and specific Sandinista emplacements. Also among the 12 charges for which North is being tried are allegations that he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by denying reports that he was giving tactical and procurement advice to the Contras in defiance of the ban which took effect in October 1984. He was a Marine lieutenant colonel and a top <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide at the time. In 1985, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified, he took part in efforts to open a `` southern front'' along <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Costa Rican border. At <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s direction he flew to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> to view possible sites for an airstrip that eventually was built for the effort to resupply the Contras He said he also, reluctantly, accepted $ 1,000 in traveler's checks from <PERSON> North </PERSON> as a wedding present The government charges that that money was part of $ 4,300 that <PERSON> North </PERSON> is accused of embezzling. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said that in March 1986 the role of retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> _ who he said was running the secret arms resupply network for North _ was being exposed. `` What you had hoped to keep quiet is now being openly discussed on the street,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> wrote to North in a memo. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> also faces criminal charges in the Iran-Contra affair but has yet to come to trial. That same month, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified, <PERSON> North </PERSON> asked him to fly to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> aboard a plane loaded with humanitarian supplies, then to supervise loading of weapons to be dropped to the rebels. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who by then was working with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government humanitarian relief effort, protested his contract barred him from delivering weapons. `` He said, between the two of us, I would fly down on <ORGANIZATION> NHAO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, put on my <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> private citizen hat, and fly with the ammunition,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified. He said when he got to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> there was no ammunition to be loaded. Prosecutors questioned <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> for nearly five hours Friday. North's lawyers will cross-examine him Monday <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who testified under a prosecution grant of immunity, is a 1978 <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate. After college he worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and was an aide to then-Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is now vice president After leaving <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s office, he went to work for <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> public relations firms. When <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> representatives asked the firm in 1983 to set up a fund-raising campaign, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he was sent to North. In the course of things, he met Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and eventually went on his payroll with undefined duties for $ 2,500 a month salary and expenses. He said his work was `` more with North than <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he was puzzled why so many memos that <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> North </PERSON> contained aliases. `` I did not want to put his name or my name on documents I was writing,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. `` For security reasons I just did not want my name floating around. For the same reason I did not want to put Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s name on documents. North was referred to as `` <PERSON> Steelhammer </PERSON>,'' `` Hammer'' and `` B.G.'' The latter stood for `` Blood and Guts,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified. A month after the congressional edict against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> outlined a plan for attacking Soviet Hind helicopters that were being delivered to the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said he relayed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s idea and delivered maps of the airport to <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> described the armor-clad Hind helicopter as `` the most dangerous helicopter in the world.'' He said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was `` concerned if these weapons, these platforms, were targeted against the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> resistance, it would decimate it.'' The Contras, fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government, had only three small airplanes of a push-pull type in which there was one propeller in front and one aft. North feared the raid `` would be a suicide mission undertaken by the pilots'' who would not have enough fuel to return to their base, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. On another trip south in early 1985, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said, <PERSON> North </PERSON> asked him to take a series of maps to <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> also asked that he get from <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> `` a list of military goods needed right now.''

 Thousands of Estonians celebrated their Independence Day Friday by hoisting their national flag over the highest castle tower in the capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> after relegating the flag of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to a museum. The Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said `` many thousands'' of people attended, including the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Vaino </PERSON> <PERSON> Vyalyas </PERSON>. Soviet television showed crowds in the cobble-stoned <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> was a province of the czarist Russian empire, but it proclaimed itself independent on Feb. 24, 1918, after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. The small Baltic republic was absorbed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940 under a secret protocol between <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that divided <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into spheres of influence. The blue, black and white banner hoisted on Friday was the flag of independent <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> between the world wars. The flag of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> that flew for decades when displaying the tricolor banner was illegal was taken down Thursday night before and given to a local Communist historical museum, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The decision to proclaim Feb. 24 as the day of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s independence and to raise the blue, black and white national flag on the <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> tower on that day is an important step toward restoring the <LOCATION> Estonian </LOCATION> people's dignity and recognizing their genuine history,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> The flag-raising ceremony also was attended by clergymen and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> unofficial political movement. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has led the drive during the past year to wrest more cultural and economic autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Party and government leaders have been replaced by those sympathetic to the organization's goals. In November the republic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, declared sovereignty in all areas except foreign and military affairs. The Kremlin declared that move invalid, but <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has not backed down. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruitel </PERSON>, president of the presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet, told a rally outside the tower, `` it should be clearly realized that dates of national history and national symbols should not be regarded as something hostile to socialism. Soviet officials last summer eased restrictions on the drive for more autonomy in the nearby republics of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> as well as in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. The local parliaments moved quickly to make ethnic languages official and permit use of national flags on holidays, sporting events and cultural rallies.

 Opposition and government negotiators agreed on a proposal Friday that would allow new trade unions to form and legalize the Solidarity independent union movement, officials said. The proposal was reached by a working group that is part of the broad talks between the government and opposition on political and economic reforms. The proposed labor law is the result of a Feb. 16 agreement by the sides to amend the current labor act. The proposal would have to be passed by the Sejm, or parliament, to become law. The proposal would allow trade unions to organize nationally. The current law that took effect in 1982 restricted how quickly a nationwide union could form. `` The whole nationwide union will be allowed to shape its internal organizations freely. The draft was not questioned and was accepted,'' said <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the leader of the opposition delegation to the talks. At a meeting with students at the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polytechnic </LOCATION> on Friday, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said that `` Until now I am satisfied with the discussions and with the fact that all -LRB- sides -RRB- agree about the necessity of reforms. But I feel a lack of political decisions.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he has asked his advisers and Solidarity negotiators to provide a `` point by point'' list of the biggest stumbling blocks that would require political decisions. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said more talks were needed on how to resolve conflicts when rival unions form at the same enterprise. The official trade union alliance, OPZZ, proposed that disputes between trade unions be the subject of a worker referendum, said the leader of the OPZZ delegation, <PERSON> Romuald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosnowski </PERSON>, on state television. At a news conference, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said only the most important issues should be put to a referendum and that the <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION> proposal seemed `` demagogic.'' `` Let's hope that despite everything, it's only the difficult beginning of trade union pluralism and that we will push forward at the next meeting,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said. Th government has made it clear that Solidarity will be legalized only if the opposition accepts a whole package of political and eocnomic reforms. The talks began Feb. 6 and are expected to last six weeks. Solidarity was born in the labor turmoil of 1980, the first free union in the Soviet bloc, then suppressed and outlawed after the declaration of martial law in December 1981. Also Friday, at least 25 people were arrested during in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and the southern city of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Several hundred people gathered in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s market square to protest the beating of demonstrators during a Feb. 17 rally against political indoctrination in schools, said rally spokesman <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON>. Police used water cannons and tear gas to break up the protest, he said. Ten people were arrested, he said. Two people were taken away in an ambulance and several others were beaten, said a student activist who declined identification. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, police arrested at least 15 supporters of the `` Orange Alternative,'' an independent group founded in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> that has attracted attention for its satirical street events mocking authority. A crowd of several hundred people watched as members painted store windows and the street with bright orange paint.

 Television cameras, normally barred from federal courtrooms, have been used to record <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> proceedings in what a group of news organizations hopes will be the start of a trend. The TV cameras and sound equipment were operating for two hours Thursday as lawyers argued the constitutionality of drug tests for military personnel. The almost unprecedented presence of the equipment was authorized by the three-judge court on a request by 13 news organizations, including the four major television networks. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the organizations, said the results were encouraging. `` Everybody was very excited about it and pleased with the results and the quality of the pictures,'' he said. <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said the filming, which will be broadcast at a later date, was done without enhanced lighting and using the court's own sound system. <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said he believed it was the first time TV cameras have been used to record proceedings in any federal court. But some years ago a federal judge in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, permitted cameras in his courtroom. A demonstration of television cameras in court was conducted by <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> last November for three <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices. That was a trial run _ not a live court proceeding _ aimed at winning support from the high court for the idea. While nearly all states allow some televised state court coverage, the federal courts have remained adamant in banning cameras from the courtroom. <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said the military appeals court is not covered by those rules, adopted by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Judicial Conference, which helps administer the federal court system. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> is a civilian appellate court with jurisdiction over the military justice system. Two cameras were used to record Thursday's proceedings. One was focused on the three judges hearing the case and was manned by a cameraman. The second camera was unmanned and was placed at the side of the judges' bench to focus on the lawyers. <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said there are no plans for the next step in the campaign to change the policy against televised federal court proceedings. But he said those present Thursday felt there was no disruption. `` We talked to the judges and counsel afterward and they say they saw no problem with it,'' <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said. `` One lawyer said he was nervous, but because his wife was there.''

 The new constitution approved by Algerian voters will increase civil liberties and usher in a new era of democracy in this once staunchly socialist nation, the interior minister said Friday. More than 70 percent of the 10.4 million voters in Thursday's balloting voted in favor of the new constitution, according to results announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Friday About 80 percent of the North African nation's 13 million voters cast ballots, the ministry said, clearing the way for a multi-party political system for the first time since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1962. Interior Minister <PERSON> Aboubakr </PERSON> <PERSON> Belkaid </PERSON> said the new constitution will allow his country `` to know more democracy, to assure public and individual liberties and to establish the sovereignty of the law.'' He said it `` opens the way to a new era'' in multiple-party politics. The new charter continues the political and social reforms promised by President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> after a week of anti-government riots in October left at least 176 people dead. Parliament in the coming weeks is expected to consider a set of measures governing the operation of political parties and an electoral code. Most Algerians welcomed the reforms, but Islamic fundamentalists, who have already begun organizing a political association, had reservations. Islamic leader <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bel-Hadj </PERSON> said fellow Moslems could not support a pluralistic system that was in `` conflict with the ideology and contradicted the beliefs of our people.'' Thursday was the third time in less than four months that Algerians were asked to vote. In November, voters approved a set of political reforms that reduced the influence of the country's single party, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. In December, about 81 percent of the voters elected <ORGANIZATION> Benjedid </ORGANIZATION>, 59, to lead the country of 25 million for a third five-year term. October's violent unrest was blamed on an economy battered by falling world oil prices. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> derives 95 percent of its export revenue from oil. Algerians blamed the centralized, socialist government for failing to solve the economic problems behind high unemployment, a shortage of goods, inadequate housing and a general decline in living standards. Although it does not specifically authorize competing political parties, the new constitution declares `` the right to create associations of a political character,'' and several have already been formed in anticipation of the reform. The new constitution also guarantees freedom of expression and, within limits, the right to strike. It restricts the army to defending the `` national independence, the unity and territorial integrity of the country.'' Under the old charter, the army had a role in `` development of the country and the building of socialism.'' The new text does not refer to socialism. The old constitution declared that `` the Algerian state is socialist.'' Islam remains the state religion and Arabic the official language.

 Unusually cold weather for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> caught network television by surprise Friday, and citrus growers and vegetable farmers braced for a second night of arctic air. Except for a potato crop in north <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and some strawberry losses, most fruit and vegetables made it through Thursday night's first frosty blast of the winter without much trouble as a blustery, bone-chilling cold wave swept the length of the peninsula Thursday and early Friday And unlike states to the north which had snow-covered highways, the snow that blew across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s northern tier from the Panhandle to <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> was just enough to amaze people before it melted. Police reported a minor traffic jam in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> Thursday afternoon when drivers stopped along a major thoroughfare to watch snow fall _ the first flurries there since March 1, 1986. `` I've never seen it snow that hard here,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, in the Panhandle. `` Maybe it has snowed longer, but I've never seen it come down that hard. It lasted about five minutes, was very thick and very gray.'' Cities as far south as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> had record lows in the 30s Friday morning. The chilly weather at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which had a low of 39, forced the crew and stars of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show indoors to the Carlyle Hotel. The program had moved to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to boost a local affiliate and to show some warm weather to the rest of the shivering nation. Snowbirds _ Northerners who move south for the winter _ gathered outside the hotel, bundled up in sweaters and coats to get a glimpse of <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheinker </PERSON>, a retiree from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, said the cool temperatures at the beach did n't bother him. `` We're used to it. It's not that bad,'' he said. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of Erie, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was not complaining either. `` This is 50 degrees warmer than the place we just left,'' he said. Anyway, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said, the Today people should n't have been surprised: `` A week ago -LRB- `` Today'' show weatherman -RRB- <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> warned us it would be cold.'' Temperatures early Saturday were predicted in the teens and low 20s, meaning a hard freeze or frost all the way into lush citrus-and vegetable-growing areas of central and southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It's going to be colder than last night,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON>. There were scattered reports of damage to peaches and strawberries. But farmers in the heart of strawberry country, <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, said cloud cover kept temperatures just above freezing and saved the fragile crop just one week before the annual Plant City Strawberry Festival. `` The timing could n't be worse,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeks </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Strawberries are at their prime. The fields and plants are loaded; they're just hanging there.'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state's billion-dollar citrus industry, said temperatures Thursday and Friday were not low enough for long enough periods to cause any damage anywhere in the citrus belt. <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Basically most of the industry got by without any significant problem.'' One exception was a crop of early-spring potatoes in the <LOCATION> Hastings-Palatka </LOCATION> area. The spuds had grown larger than normal because of the unusually warm weather of the past few weeks, and they could not all be rebedded in time to escape freezing temperatures Thursday night, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The extent of damage was unknown.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Friday suspended three men from doing business with the federal government in a move stemming from the long-running investigation of defense contract fraud. Two of the men, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, were suspended as a result of their guilty pleas on Jan. 27 to making illegal campaign contributions to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's proposal for a $ 5 billion reduction in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> next fiscal year appeared Friday to be going nowhere. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he would n't support the proposed reduction, which was also turned down by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the day before. `` The idea that we can save some $ 5 billion, I think, is unacceptable,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, whose committee has jurisdiction on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> side over the federal health insurance program for the elderly. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> costs have been growing rapidly as the number of elderly Americans increases and as the prices of medical services rise faster than the general rate of inflation. This year's <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> costs of $ 84.5 billion would grow to $ 97.5 next year without restraints. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, proposed to hold the program to $ 92.5 billion in fiscal 1990 by limiting payments to hospitals and doctors who treat <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients and by trimming supplementary payments to teaching hospitals. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, however, said the financial strain on many hospitals would not withstand the proposed cut, which would shave more than $ 3.5 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments to hospitals. `` The numbers we're looking at now ... -LRB- indicate -RRB- many are at the break-even point and this is further complicated by the substantial number of hospitals that have had to close their doors and have n't been able to make ends meet,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said `` A reduction of that amount is excessive and we'd be going too far,'' he said. The chairman declined to say how much of a savings he would be willing to support. The Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has jurisdiction over the program on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> side, said in a report Thursday that `` it is not reasonable to expect providers or beneficiaries to absorb the level of reductions proposed by the administration in the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program for fiscal year 1990.''

<TEXT>
 The mayor's office has been held by Democrats for half a century and that's unlikely to change this year, but a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> write-in candidate may throw a small monkey wrench into the opposition works in Tuesday's primary. At the very least, the outnumbered Republicans got a moment in the spotlight when, with less than a week to go, flashy former Democrat <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> made his write-in bid official Wednesday. Democratic frontrunner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor and son of the late Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, and acting Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> say they expect little impact on their contest, though some observers say <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>'s bid on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> side could siphon off some of <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s white ethnic votes. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate endorsed by the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> party, says he'll whip <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> hands down. <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> is black, will take on the Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary winners as a third-party candidate in the April 4 special general election. Analysts say <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> is a long-shot for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, and that odds are even worse for a Republican winner in April. The party's last mayor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> `` Big Bill'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, lost his 1931 re-election bid. In a radio-show recording session, <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> said he hopes to win 10,000 votes; that amount could guarantee him the nomination in this Democratic stronghold and is half what he got from his ward in a failed 1987 mayoral bid. His big challenge Tuesday will be to get people to properly write in votes with punch-card voting machines, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in suburban University Park who follows city politics. `` It's physically very difficult to have legal write-ins on a punch-card system,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> showed he can still draw a crowd at Wednesday's rally, where a multiracial crowd cheered him on and supporters said they had more than 50,000 signatures on petitions drafting him for the race <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> switched parties after resigning from <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and giving up his post as chairman of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to mount his third-party challenge to <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor, two years ago. <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, 61, shares the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> ballot with former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committeeman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurst </PERSON>, 62, and a businessman who has been accused of writing an anti-Semitic and racist tract, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grutzmacher </PERSON>, 58.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said Friday that a Swiss-based currency trading company may have been involved in a massive money-laundering scandal involving drugs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the possible role of the Lebanese-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Shakarchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zurich </ORGANIZATION> was revealed during the `` largest drug money laundering investigation ever conducted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agencies.'' `` Among many aspects revealed by this investigation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was the fact that a bank account maintained there by the <ORGANIZATION> Shakarchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> may have been involved in transactions with some of the targets `` of the probe, the statement said. <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON> <PERSON> Trading </PERSON> <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> is headed by a Lebanese, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON>. Its vice president until last Oct. 27 was <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, the husband of former Swiss Justice Minister <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> resigned last month after admitting she tipped her husband off that the company might come under scrutiny by Swiss authorities. The company's name has been mentioned in connection with a probe launched by a <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> prosecutor into the origins of more than $ 2 billion allegedly transferred to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> by two Lebanese brothers, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barkev </PERSON> <PERSON> Magharian </PERSON>. Both are being held in <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, on suspicion of fraud. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON>, a business contact of the Magharians, has denied any part in drug money laundering. Swiss prosecutor <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> said in a report this month that <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON> told investigators he had warned a manager of <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION>, the counrty's third largest commercial bank, that funds deposited by the Magharians with the bank were of doubtful origin. Swiss government spokesman <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON> told reporters Friday Swiss authorities were examining whether judicial proceedings can be opened against the <PERSON> Shakarchi </PERSON> company. He said the company's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> account contained $ 500,000 believed by investigators to be drug money. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s news release said that during the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> probe, code-named `` Operation Polar Cap,'' it emerged that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had in the past purchased foreign currency from the Shakarchi Trading company. But it said `` these past legitimate purchases have no known bearing on any aspect of this or any other criminal investigation.'' Money laundering is not punishable in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> unless the funds are used for criminal purposes. Legislation to make it a criminal offense is being drafted.

 <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders completed action Friday on a resolution denouncing former <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansman </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and denying him any financial or technical assistance from the national party. `` What makes a Republican is not the approval of some backroom committee, but the approval of the voters who elected me,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said when told of the action. The resolution was adopted unanimously by a telephone vote of the 11 members of the party's executive committee. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> was elected as a Republican to the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> Saturday despite appeals by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on behalf of his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> opponent, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treen </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s election, he was denounced by <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated his only regret about opposing <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> was that it might have helped him. `` Mr. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> can not take away me being a Republican nor can this committee,'' said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. `` As far as not giving me any money or technical assistance, I did n't need any money or technical assistance to win this race and I wo n't need any money or technical assistance to win any future races I may be involved in.'' The opposition of national party leaders had little impact on Republican legislators in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, who welcomed <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> into their ranks when he was sworn in on Wednesday. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the national party, said the vote was conducted over the last two days. She said a copy of the resolution was not available because party lawyers were refining its language. However, a proposed resolution, made public late last week, denounced the former <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> leader, saying that <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> `` may be a Republican in party registration but he is not a Republican in gesture, deed or belief.'' The resolution described <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> as a former `` grand dragon of the White Knights of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> and the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, which embraces views antithetical to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; `` Secondly, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and these groups preach doctrines of racial, religious and ethnic hatred, bigotry and discrimination against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens which are abhorrent to the American tradition and have no place in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.''

 A member of the city school board and a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Statehood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said Friday they plan to organize a campaign seeking to draft civil rights activist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to run for mayor next year. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockridge </PERSON>, a school board member, and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Chorlton </PERSON>, a Statehood Party leader, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they are planning to organize the draft-Jackson drive, expected to center on gathering petition signatures. They said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who made unsuccessful bids for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 and recently denied being interested in seeking the mayor's office, had no knowledge of their plans. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has owned a home in northwest <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since 1984, and embattled Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a Democrat who was first elected in 1978 and has not announced whether he will seek a fourth four-year term in 1990, were not immediately available for comment. However, after leading an anti-drug rally at a local high school two weeks ago, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` I've expressed no interest in the job.'' He added that `` under no condition would I run against <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>.'' `` We want to show <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that he should express interest in the job,'' said <PERSON> Lockridge </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has not decided what he will do, but I think this movement will help him come to the right decision. For now, we're just asking <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> to listen to what the voters will have to say.'' `` The district is suffering a crisis in spirit,'' <PERSON> Chorlton </PERSON> said. `` We need a leader _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ who can pull people together toward something positive.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has been trying to deal with a drug-related crime wave in the city, and has appeared before a federal grand jury investigating his ties to a drug suspect. He has repeatedly denied using drugs or knowingly being associated with drug dealers or users. Under city law, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> could qualify for the 1990 election by switching his voter registration from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to the district by November 1989.

 Police in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, opened fire Friday on Moslem mobs protesting `` The Satanic Verses,'' killing up to 12 people, and an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader said the novel might cause a `` vast battle'' between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the West. Officials in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> asked Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to press the Iranian patriarch, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, to lift his command that followers kill <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of the novel Moslems call blasphemous. News reports said police gunfire wounded 40 people during the <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> protest by about 5,000 people after midday Moslem prayers and that 11 police officers were injured. Police said they arrested 300 demonstrators. The protesters ignored a ban on assembly of more than five people in public places Friday, the Moslem sabbath. A police spokesman said they set fire to several buses and other vehicles and attacked police. Police imposed the ban after some Moslems announced plans to demonstrate against the book, which they say is blasphemous. Reports of the death toll conflicted. Press Trust said 12 people were killed, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> put it at 10, and Police Commissioner S.M. <PERSON> Shangari </PERSON> said eight had died. Two deaths initially attributed to the violence were caused by unrelated road accidents, he said. Demonstrations also were reported in the Indian cities of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, Darjeeling, <LOCATION> Varanasi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Patna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siliguri </LOCATION>. No violence was reported. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, about 400 Moslems marched to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, and the city's 32-officer police force was put on alert. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> banned <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book in November, fearing it could spark sectarian unrest. More than 90 million Moslems live in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and make up about 11 percent of the nation's population of 880 million. The novel also is banned in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was born into a Moslem family in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> in 1947. Now a British citizen, he has been under police guard in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> first ordered Moslems on Feb. 14 to kill him. Iranian clerics have put a $ 5.2 million bounty on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s head. In demonstrations Feb. 12-13, one person was killed in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and six died in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where police opened fire on a crowd that attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic office. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, urged Western countries to state clearly if they agree with the contents of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said Moslems want to know if Western governments support what the book says about <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> `` so that we know what our duty is regarding those who are a partner in cursing the prophet.'' `` The ground has been laid for a vast battle between Islam on the one hand, and paganism and arrogance on the other,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said in the prayer sermon in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, broadcast by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> sources said Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> had written <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> urging him to tell <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> that `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> shares the international community's wish to see <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> respect international obligations and renounce the use of violence.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, on a 10-day <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tour, will meet with <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> on Saturday in a rare audience with the religious patriarch. The Soviet Ambassador to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamyatin </PERSON>, said the controversy `` clearly shows the need for respect for religious feelings and traditions as well as tolerance for the politics and values of others.'' The 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have recalled their envoys from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has shut down its mission in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> pulled its ambassadors out of the Common Market nations. Nearly 2,000 Moslems rallied in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Friday and called for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book to be withdrawn from library shelves. They waved placards and ripped a cardboard effigy of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to pieces. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s home secretary, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, said his country's 750,000 Moslems were entitled to protest `` peacefully and with dignity'' against a book `` which they believe denigrates and insults the prophet of Islam. `` But to turn such protests toward violence or the threat of violence is wholly unacceptable,'' he told a meeting of Moslems in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, was threatened with death by a man who called the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> correspondent for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Guardian newspaper and said <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> `` wo n't leave <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> alive. ... He is a great infidel like <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>,'' the newspaper said. In <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, a man called The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies would be bombed. He said he spoke in the name of `` Islamic Jihad for the Honor of Islam.'' Another caller said a bomb was placed at the British Council office in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> but no bomb was found, police said. <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> Governor <PERSON> Cahit </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayar </PERSON> said security precautions were taken at foreign missions in the city. He did not elaborate. Some Moslem priests in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> denounced <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> during their Friday sermons and one said he should be killed, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Many people in the predominantly Moslem country have said they disapprove of `` The Satanic Verses,'' but others have opposed <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat.

 Police opened fire Friday during violent protests against `` The Satanic Verses'' in author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s native city, killing up to 12 people and injuring 40, according to news reports At least 5,000 Moslems chanting `` <PERSON> Allahu </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON>!'' -LRB- God is Great -RRB- gathered in central <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> after midday prayers. Mobs set fire to buses and other vehicles and attacked several officers, said a policeman on duty at <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> headquarters. He said police arrested 300 protesters. The news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said at least 11 policemen were injured.

 Thousands of World War II veterans gathered across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ some in prayer services, some in pubs _ to remember comrades killed by Japanese soldiers in the name of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. In meetings and protests that stretched from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, some vented their anger at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime leader, and others even celebrated his death Protesters in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> burned <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> flags in two cities, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> denounced <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as an `` inveterate enemy of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people'' and British veterans in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> marched with placards saying `` <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was a war criminal'' and `` Down with Japanese imperialism.'' In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, elderly ex-soldiers and former prisoners of war held more than 25 services at war memorials and in churches to coincide with the emperor's grand state funeral. `` Our purpose is to remember those of our colleagues who suffered as a result of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s army,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose 68 chapters organized the services. Some veterans were angry that Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s husband, Prince <PERSON> Philip </PERSON>, joined world leaders at ceremonies in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and that he made a slight bow of the head at the emperor's coffin and to the new emperor, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said the bow was `` a formal and entirely usual act of courtesy to a reigning sovereign.'' But <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said before a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> church service that drew 1,000 people, `` It's also in our minds ... that by all these dignitaries going to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the Japanese will think they're exonerated from blame.'' At the service, <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> refused to speak to a reporter from the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s newspaper, <LOCATION> Akahata </LOCATION>, and said he asked the reporter to leave. Many of those taking part were among the 52,000 British and Australian prisoners held under brutal conditions after the fall of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> in 1942. Many had worked on the `` Death Railway,'' the supply line between <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> whose construction cost 16,000 lives. During the service at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin-in-the-Fields </ORGANIZATION>, one ex-POW spoke of forgiveness. `` If we ... allow bitterness and hatred to dominate our lives it will lead to self-destruction,'' Maj. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunstan </PERSON>, a 68-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who had been captured in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, said in an interview at the church, `` We're going to the local pub to celebrate putting that so-and-so six foot under where he should have been long ago. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, riot police with shields dispersed about 70 protesters who tried to march to the Japanese protests. Police took 10 marchers into custody. Protesters denounced <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> as `` mankind's biggest war criminal'' and burned <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> flags in rallies in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. During 36 years of Japanese rule, allegiance to the emperor was demanded of all Koreans, who also were ordered to adopt Japanese names and speak Japanese. `` The arch crimes <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had committed against our nation have not yet been paid off,'' the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government newspaper <PERSON> Minju </PERSON> <PERSON> Chosun </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, about 5,190 people turned out for 71 anti-emperor demonstrations across the country, and 12 people were arrested, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arakawa </PERSON> said. The bitterness comes despite a view generally held by historians that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was only a titular leader with little political power. Others, while bitter, did not want to think about the emperor anymore. `` No way was this funeral going to overshadow the memory of the lads,'' said <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON>, vice president of the national ex-POW association and organizer of a service attended by 600 in the northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION>.

 A federal appeals court on Friday refused to grant a new hearing in the partial merger of two <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> newspapers but continued to block the transaction to give opponents a chance for further appeal. The 5-4 decision left the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as the only avenue of appeal for a coalition of newspaper readers and advertisers who have sought to halt the joint operating agreement between The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> rejected a petition, filed by the 500-member <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, for a hearing by the full court. A three-judge appeals panel in January had said the newspapers were entitled to a partial exemption from federal antitrust laws and could merge business and production departments. The court said its stay delaying the partial merger `` shall remain in effect until 5 p.m. EST on March 6, 1989, to afford appellants an opportunity to apply to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a stay beyond that date.'' The Washington-based advocacy group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, which is handling the legal work for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens, said opponents would decide by Wednesday whether to ask the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to take the case. Attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said: `` I think the fact that it was 5-4 shows we were right, we had a strong shot.'' The News, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1986 asked permission for the partial merger in order to keep the Free Press from going out of business Then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> approved the application last year, and opponents began appeals. Under the proposed agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> would initially take 55 percent of the joint operation's profits or losses, and after six years the split would become 50-50 for the next 94 years. The newspapers would retain separate news and editorial departments. The majority opinion opposing a rehearing, written by Judge <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>, argued that cost-cutting by the newspapers was irrelevant to the case. `` Congress authorized the attorney general to prevent a city newspaper editorial monopoly _ even at the risk of a shared economic monopoly _ because it thought the unusual economics of the newspaper industry compelled that exception to the antitrust laws,'' <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON> wrote. `` Otherwise, one newspaper may achieve a stunning fusion of economic and editorial _ political _ power due to the loss of actual and potential competition.'' The dissenting opinion, written by Chief Judge <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, said the attorney general had accepted the premise that one of the newspapers cut prices to eliminate a rival. `` Where ... two independent papers can compete legally and stay alive, condoning resort by one to pricing which on the record is hard to distinguish from illegal predatory pricing in order to secure a monopoly protected by a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> will, ironically, make it even more probable that newspapers will disappear,'' <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> wrote. `` We have taken another vital step toward knowing there will be a strong future for this newspaper,'' said Free Press Publisher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. `` We are getting there, but after almost three years of this process, we will not breathe comfortably until all of this is finally behind us. `` It is time for everybody's lives to go on. I would hope that everyone, including opponents, would agree enough is enough.'' `` We are gratified by the decision of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> not to rehear the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> case,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, president of Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` We will be consulting as soon as possible with our attorneys and officials at <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> to plan our next moves.'' Officials of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, Va.-based <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the court's decision.

<HEAD>Investigators Clear Hospital In Treatment Of 11-Year-Old Pregnant

 A hospital that transferred an 11-year-old girl who was five months pregnant with twins to another hospital violated no federal or state law, officials said Friday. One of the fetuses was stillborn, the other, which weighed 9 ounces, died shortly after it was delivered later that day. The case came under investigation when <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> filed a report, as required by the new state law, about the transfer. Tallahassee Memorial and <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which transfered the girl, disagreed on whether the girl was in labor at the time. <PERSON> Rheb </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, said the case was a `` classic medical nightmare.'' `` But once you look beyond the shock of it and ask yourself whether or not appropriate medical care was delivered you would have to conclude, as both the federal and the state governments have, that it was,'' he said Friday. The child walked into <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Community on Jan. 9, accompanied by her grandmother and complaining of indigestion, <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON> said. A doctor determined she was five months pregnant with twins, and that one of the babies was in a breech position, <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON> said. `` She was not in labor when she presented at the hospital but she was clearly having problems with her pregnancy,'' he said. The doctor decided to transfer the child by ambulance to nearby <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Memorial. Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Memorial has a specialist in premature births on duty around the clock, <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON> said. The child was upset and did not follow directions to keep her legs together to prevent her amniotic sac from dropping further, he said. The doctor put two strips of tape on top of the girl's thighs to remind her. `` In no way whatsoever were her legs immobilized or bound or wrapped or any other of the descriptions that have been floating about,'' said <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harbison </PERSON> said his hospital received notification Thursday from the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that federal investigators found no evidence that the hospital had violated regulations prohibiting hospitals from transferring indigent people to other hospitals for emergency care. Federal rules specifically bar hospitals from tranferring women or girls to another hospital if they are in labor. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> also found no evidence that <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Community violated a state law prohibiting hospitals from questionning patients needing emergency care before deciding treatment, according to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Konicki </PERSON>, an HRS spokesman. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brafford </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that officials at his hospital thought the girl was in labor when she arrived and `` that's what constituted a violation.'' Community officials acknowledged that the girl should not have been sent alone in the ambulance for the two-mile trip, and said a nurse will accompany any patients transferred in the future.

 The first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights report on <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, released Friday, said Cuban prisoners complained of torture but that <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government denied mistreating them. A six-member team that spent 10 days in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in September compiled the 400-page report and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which includes 43 nations, will begin discussing it Tuesday. In their report, the investigators said they received more than 1,600 complaints of human rights violations, including 137 of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The torture allegations were in a letter signed by 22 political prisoners and handed to two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representatives who visited <LOCATION> Combinado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Este </LOCATION> prison in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. It said: `` The Cuban tormentors, advised by experts in political repression, mainly Russians and Czechs, inflict all kinds of torture.'' Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s interior minister, told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representatives `` a number of detainees or prisoners had in the past been beaten'' but those responsible had been punished, their report said. `` He said there are no cases of torture,'' the report said. Most of the complaints _ 1,183 _ were from Cubans who declared it `` difficult to leave the country either temporarily or permanently,'' the investigators reported. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has said 20,000 Cubans could leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year under an agreement with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. During the first nine months of 1988 only 5,932 had gone, however, and the report quoted Vice President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> as blaming <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. `` non-compliance.'' Much of the report was devoted to statistics suggesting a great improvement in education and health care since <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s revolution in 1959. It also quoted cultural figures as praising his literacy campaign and promotion of cultural life. Ambassador <PERSON> Alioune </PERSON> <PERSON> Sene </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> led the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team, whose other members were from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are the world's worst human rights offenders, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should send investigators to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> once a year as it does with such other countries as <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government has said it will not allow another visit.

<HEAD>Fire Destroys Half Of Remaining Brazilian Coastal Forest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Firemen and volunteers on Friday battled a 20-day fire that has destroyed tens of thousands of acres of one of the country's most important wildlife preserves, officials said. Firefighters have been unable to check the blaze, which began as a series of brush fires throughout the northeastern coastal state of <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON> of the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. He spoke in a telephone interview from the rural town of <LOCATION> Eunapolis </LOCATION>, about 651 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. `` The situation is extremely serious and worsening,'' said <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>. `` The various fires are joining each other and are burning day and night.'' He said the fire, which has destroyed half of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, has swept through more than 75,000 acres of the virgin wilderness. The cause of the fire is not known. But local farmers often set fire to their land at this time of the year to renew their pastures or burn garbage, da Costa said. He blamed a two-month drought in the region and a lack of funds from the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> state government for making the task of fighting the blaze `` more than impossible.'' `` I just saw two large plantations go up in smoke in a couple of hours,'' da Costa said. `` We have teams of four trying to contain the fire in spots because we have no money to work with. What fire can you stop with four men?'' Just 3 percent of the once-vast <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, which in the 16th century covered about 170,000 square miles along a 3,000-mile coastal strip, remains standing today. Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found nowhere else in the world, face extinction. Among them is the Pau-Brasil, the tree that gave the country its name. Fires also have broken out recently and raged uncontrolled in the northern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. Environmentalists and some scientists have warned that the smoke is increasing world pollution and contributing to the `` greenhouse effect,'' or warming of the earth's atmosphere.

 A `` nor'easter'' blizzard battered the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> with wind and snow Friday, lashing the sea into 30-foot waves, and the Deep South shivered with unaccustomed temperatures in the teens that iced highways and froze early spring blossoms. Temperatures dropped to record lows at 35 cities from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as arctic air surged southward. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> hit a record low of 37, equalling the temperature at <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION>, N.D. The chilly weather at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which had a low of 39, forced <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show indoors to the Carlyle Hotel. The show had moved south to boost a local affiliate and show some warm weather to a shivering nation. Slippery roads were blamed for hundreds of accidents and schools were closed from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Three weather-related deaths were reported. `` All the roads are covered, we've got ice, and people are wrecking right and left,'' said Officer <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Alleghany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, Sheriff's Department. The storm dumped 6 to 12 inches of snow across southeastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and wind gusted to 60 mph, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, chief meteorologist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. He said it was the region's first storm classified as a blizzard since 1980. The wind generated waves up to 12 feet on <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and 20-foot waves were reported on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cut back on all but essential services, and delayed the departure of seven Norfolk-based ships that had been scheduled to sail Friday morning to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> or a three-week exercise. `` The problem is visibility. There is none,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>. The storm veered northeastward and snow began falling on <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' Cape Cod by late morning while its wind was felt at sea. A Coast Guard cutter raced most of the day to reach a disabled fishing trawler with five men aboard fighting snow and 30-foot seas 50 miles off <LOCATION> Chatham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 270-foot cutter <LOCATION> Escanaba </LOCATION> reached the 75-foot trawler <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and began towing it south with the wind behind it, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. `` It's very dangerous,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` Seas are between 20 and 30 feet, which is monstrous. Visibility is real limited, with snow.'' Temperatures fell into the teens across parts of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ with wind chills below zero _ just over a week after record highs in the 70s and 80s brought peach trees and daffodils into premature bloom. Record lows included 16 degrees at <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; 19 at Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, on the Gulf Coast; and 28 at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> tied its record of 17. Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, hit a record 9 below zero. Shelters in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, opened their doors to people needing a warm place for the night. `` Anyone can come is as long as they do n't cause problems,'' said police community service officer <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgado </PERSON>. The cold was especially noticeable to tourists. `` It's probably warmer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, 28, said in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` I did n't bring any warm clothes to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. We could n't even go to the beach today and it looks like this weekend we'll have to drink and stay warm somehow.'' `` Hot chocolate sells really well when the weather gets cold,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, an assistant manager of a <ORGANIZATION> Publix </ORGANIZATION> supermarket in <LOCATION> Plantation </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` We ca n't keep it in stock.'' Tourists in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> should be happier after a warming trend begins Saturday. It is expected to push temperatures into the 70s statewide by Monday, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The snowstorm formed as a low pressure system off the coast of the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. The storm center, spinning counterclockwise, raked its wind across the coast out of the northeast, earning it the label of a `` nor'easter.'' Wind gusted to 59 mph near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and the state shut down six of the seven ferries it operates along the coast. Blizzard conditions were reported along the <LOCATION> Outer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Banks </LOCATION> islands and in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hertford </LOCATION> counties, where 18 inches of snow and drifts to 3 feet were reported, the weather service said. Roads through <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> were covered with snow, up to 11 inches fell in parts of eastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and drifts 3 to 4 feet high were reported in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, the weather service said. `` Snow shovels and rock salt. Those are the two biggest sellers at the moment,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, an employee at <ORGANIZATION> Pleasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hardware </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` We sold out of sleds Saturday or we'd be selling those, too.'' Up to 9 inches of snow was measured at <LOCATION> McKee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, with 8 inches at <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> May </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the weather service said. `` The road crews are out in full force, but as soon as they plow, the wind covers the road over again,'' said <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Trooper <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roesch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> ordered some state offices closed Friday because of the storm. The cold threatened some crops in the South. At <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where an annual strawberry festival is planned to open March 2, farmers struggled to shield their plants. `` You know how your stomach feels when you think you could lose everything you worked for? That's the feeling we're getting now,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, whose fields are east of <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. However, cloud cover kept the temperature just above freezing at <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, farmers said. Peach growers in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> burned tires and coal in orchards during the night to protect trees against the cold, but there were scattered reports of damage. Citrus growers in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> reported no problems Friday, thanks partly to light wind that stirred up the air, but weather service forecaster <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> said Friday night was going to be colder. Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, flood-stricken <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> was declared a major disaster area by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Friday, making federal aid available to affected people and local governments. The region was hit by heavy rain and flooding beginning Feb. 13.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated 750 employees declared a 24-hour strike Friday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other cities to protest a reported order by Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to prosecute bank Gov. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> for misuse of power. They threatened to extend the strike indefinitely unless charges were dropped. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> threatened to resign on Friday over the incident. Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, is head of the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s official radio said <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> faces charges that include `` misuse of authority, mismanagement and failure to control manipulation in certain financial institutions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> handles the accounts of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual governments, one headed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the other by <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The bank was the only government institution not divided by nearly 14 years of civil strife. <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> his resignation and those of two of his deputies would be submitted to the two cabinets `` when the time comes.'' `` I do n't know why they want to prosecute me. I'm ready to submit my resignation,'' he said. The bank depends on cash flow on whatever income tax, excise and customs duties the two governments can collect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s war-ravaged economy Other sources of income include revenue from government-owned properties, trade in foreign exchange and deposits by commercial banks. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was appointed to head an interim military Cabinet by outgoing President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> last Sept. 22 after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a new president. Syrian-backed Moslems rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment and declared recognition only of <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' incumbent Cabinet.

<TEXT>
 Blacks in the mining town of <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> plan a consumer boycott and civil disobedience campaign next week to protest the resegregation of public facilities, union leaders said Friday. The boycott was sparked by the reintroduction of strict segregation by the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which took control of the town council in last October's municipal elections. The council has voted to resegregate local facilities that had been opened to all races and to build a fence to keep blacks off the town hall's lawn. The council said last month it was considering a curfew barring blacks from the town at night, but no action has been taken. <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>, 45 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, is one of several dozen towns captured by the Conservatives last October. Local affiliates of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the country's largest black labor federation, said the <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION> boycott would begin Monday and would include demonstrations and a sit-in at a park that recently was declared `` whites only.'' A leader of <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>'s town council, <PERSON> Koos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nel </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would not bow to pressure. `` If white businesses are affected, I will be the first to admit I'm sorry, but I ca n't change,'' he said. `` If we give in once, then what's coming next?'' A black consumer boycott has been under way since December in the industrial town of <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, where the Conservative-controlled council has resegregated public facilities. On Friday, <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> town councilors threatened to cut off the electricity of Asians living illegally in `` whites-only'' areas. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government has made no move to halt the <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> boycott even though state-of-emergency regulations prohibit the organization of such protests. The government has condemned the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s resegregation campaign, but has been accused of hypocrisy because it has made no move to repeal the Separate Amenities Act, which allows blacks to be barred from local facilities The state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the act `` has caused problems at every level of South African life.'' `` On a personal level it results in a discrimination that was intensely hurtful,'' an <ORGANIZATION> SABC </ORGANIZATION> commentary said. `` The antagonism generated by such legislation has been an insurmountable obstacle in the essential task of promoting reconciliation between communities.'' The government said this week that police officers no longer will arrest people violating the Separate Amenities Act, but will collect information and warn the alleged offender that court procedings may ensue. The Afrikaans-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that blacks who visited a library to donate blood in Evander, another town controlled by the Conservatives, were told to leave. The 22 blacks were told to donate blood in a van outside the library, <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> reported. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Gunmen robbed a bank of $ 37,000 on Friday and wounded a police officer, officials said. A telephone caller said the robbers were part of a leftist radical group that attacked an army base last month. About six to eight well-dressed men with machine guns burst into the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galicia </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> in this central Argentine city, said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a bank spokesmen.

The independent news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> said one policeman was shot and wounded and that one of the assailants was struck on the head by a guard, then carried away by his companions. A man who identified himself as `` Commander Victor'' called the news agency and said the robbers were part of a group that attacked an army base last month. `` This is the start of the expropriation of funds for the fight to the final victory,'' the caller was quoted as saying. A man who identified himself as `` Victor'' later told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paz </ORGANIZATION> by telephone the assailants were part of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a previously unknown group that claimed responsibility for the Jan. 23 attack on the La Tablada infantry regiment outside <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. Eleven soldiers and police died in retaking the base, along with 28 armed civilians. Thirteen young men and women were arrested at the scene and are being held in jail with seven others arrested afterward pending formal presentation of charges, and trial. The caller said the group also engaged soldiers in a brief firefight at an army base in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuarto </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Cordoba </LOCATION>, earlier this month, and planned `` to continue the fight until final victory.''

 Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> toured public housing alternatives Friday and told homeless advocates he wants to be one of them, using federal money and his agency to expand housing projects for the poor. `` I do n't want to spend my time wallowing in poverty, I want to combat it,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said after touring the <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Homes </PERSON>, a public housing complex in a drug-infested <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> neighborhood. The new housing secretary, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who is closely identified with conservative `` supply-side,'' economic theory, acknowledged that dealing with homelessness would not be cheap. `` Sure, it takes money, tax money, but it's aimed at socially desirable goals on which we can reach a concensus on in this country,'' he said. `` I think there is a lot of goodwill today, that people are ready to set aside some of the polemics and get busy and make an important contribution to working on this tragedy, and I plan to be an advocate,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. His two-day visit to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was the second in a number of tours he plans across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` to see what's going on about housing,'' he said. Last week he was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Officials estimate that <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the nation's fifth-largest city, has more than 18,000 abandoned houses and more than 10,000 homeless people. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s tour guide, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a national Coalition for the Homeless lawyer, said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` is hearing that federal housing is needed, desperately needed -LRB- and -RRB- the message we get from him is that he is anxious to help.'' At the <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Homes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> visited the apartment of <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilks </PERSON>, 36, president of the tenants' council. She told <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> about vacancies, vandalism, drug trafficking and the lack of security, but expressed hope that a $ 7 million grant from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> heads, will turn things around. `` We are going to take this place back, but we need his support,'' she said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> responded, `` It's yours to take, but it's more than a federal effort. It's a state effort, a city effort and also help is needed from the private sector.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also visited a home rehabilitated with city help by a non-profit group called Dignity Housing and then rented to a former homeless family, as well as a downtown residence for 44 once-homeless adults. The downtown center was sold by the city to a non-profit organization called <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, which obtained $ 1.5 million from public and private sources for renovations. After visiting a soup kitchen and a shelter in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Thursday, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> stopped at several locations in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> before spending the night at a HUD-supported apartment complex for the elderly and the handicapped.

<HEAD>African Objections Delay Funding of Namibia Peacekeepers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Funding for the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence plan was delayed Friday by a last-minute dispute between black African nations and Western allies over whether the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> may buy goods from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> had been scheduled to approve $ 416 million for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force that will guide <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to independence after 74 years of South African rule. But the African front-line states insisted on inserting language into the funding resolution referring to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> embargos on buying military equipment, oil or other goods from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> opposed the language, noting that Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s report to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> said it would be necessary to purchase goods and services in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to keep down the cost of the mission. A key sticking point appeared to be where the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> would purchase $ 10.2 million worth of gasoline and aviation fuel, diplomats said. The two major sources for such refined products in the region are <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Overland supply from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> would be easier and less expensive. Since 1984, however, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to impose a mandatory oil embargo on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a measure that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have vetoed. General Assembly resolutions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are only advisory; <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions are enforceable. In 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution calling on all states not to buy military equipment from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which by then had developed a flourishing arms industry with export capacity. The African front-line diplomats were also debating Friday whether the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan to lease 40 mine-resistant vehicles for a year at $ 656,000 would violate the embargo. Some contended that other purchases, such as trucks, radios and construction materials for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers' barracks, also should be barred. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s budgetary committee had not resolved the issue by late Friday, a necessary step before the whole <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> can vote for funds for the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> peacekeeping force. On April 1, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> intends to begin implementing a one-year plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence under the supervision of the U.N. Transition Assistance Group. The mission will send 4,650 military peacekeepers, 500 police supervisors, more than 760 civilian <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staff, 820 locally hired staff and 620 election monitors to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, which is also called <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. If necessary, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> may dispatch a total of 7,500 troops, but the initial deployment was limited as a cost-cutting measure at the insistence of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, who together pay 57 percent of all peacekeeping costs. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since it captured the colony from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War I. In December, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed accords with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreeing to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> are sent home by mid-1991. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to send troops to help protect the Marxist government from cross-border raids by South African troops based in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and from a rebellion by the U.S.-backed rebels of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Liberation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 An Irish <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldier was machine-gunned to death by the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s foreign minister told an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> diplomat the kiling could damage Israeli-Irish ties. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> `` expressed regret for the unnecessary death,'' said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was investigating and stressed that the shooting involved only the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> and not Israeli troops, <PERSON> Barukh </PERSON> <PERSON> Binah </PERSON>, the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said Pvt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeela </PERSON>, 21, was shot in the chest by machine-gun fire from an <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> position overlooking an Irish post in the southern Lebanese village of <LOCATION> Hadatta </LOCATION>. `` Death was instantaneous,'' said <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>. `` The fire was not provoked.'' In <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON> called in the Israeli charge d'affaires and strongly protested what he called the `` unprovoked killing.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON> insisted the incident could not but have a negative effect on relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representative expressed regret and undertook to convey the views of the Irish government to the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities,'' the spokesman said. The Israeli diplomat was not identified by name. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Headquarters In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, in charge of peacekeeping, summoned <PERSON> Bein </PERSON> `` and protested strongly this incident.'' <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, in a verbal protest, repeated the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> position `` that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is responsible for the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and we do not accept the view that the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> is acting independently.'' It was a rarely publicized <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomatic complaint. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> seldom makes timely announcements of its protests. Diplomatic sources at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the incident appeared to be a mistake and that the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> militiaman apparently fired without authorization of his own superior officer. But a statement read by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said, `` The recent upsurge of <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION>'s deliberate and unprovoked firing to <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> positions, mostly to Irish, has been persistently protested with the Israeli army, but nothing had come out of these protests.'' <PERSON> McNeela </PERSON> was on his second tour of duty in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with the 700-man Irish battalion in the 5,800-member <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> force. He had planned to marry soon. <PERSON> Lars-Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahlgren </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force, visited the village later and told reporters: `` I condemn the senseless killing of one of my soldiers.'' Most SLA members are Christians. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> trains and finances the militia, which helps 1,000 Israeli troops patrol the Jewish state's self-designated `` security zone'' in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established the eight-to-10 mile zone in 1985 after withdrawing most of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 A federal judge on Friday dismissed racketeering charges against three men indicted last month in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement investigation, defense attorneys said. While the men _ two private consultants and a suspended <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement specialist _ are no longer accused of racketeering, they face a number of other criminal charges stemming from the Jan. 7 indictment, including bribery and theft of government property. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> issued his ruling from the bench, and said he would file a written order next week, according to <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Treanor </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a defendant. <PERSON> Treanor </PERSON> said the judge agreed with the defense arguments that prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to satisfy racketeering charges against consultants <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official who has been suspended without pay. Defense attorneys said a significant result of the dismissal was that the government would no longer be able to seize cash and other assets of the defendants under provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The three men were charged with racketeering and conspiracy to commit racketeering as part of a 27-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury. The 86-page indictment also included charges against <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a defense contractor that is a branch of <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and three <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> employees. But neither <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> nor its employees were charged with racketeering, which carries a penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $ 250,000. The penalty for conspiracy to commit racketeering is five years in jail and a $ 250,000. Conviction on a racketeering charge can also result in forfeiture of any property garnered illegally. Attorneys said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also dismissed some wire fraud counts against the defendants, but refused to grant motions to drop other charges. The trial is set to begin on March 27. In the indictment, the first in the government's 2-1 @ 2 year investigation into the defense purchasing system, prosecutors claimed that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> and three of its officers agreed to pay <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> $ 160,000 to assist them in obtaining a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract related to radar. The indictment contended that <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> then paid <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, a California-based consultant, who, in turn, paid <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to manipulate the contracting procedures so that <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> was assured of receiving the contract. The government's coast-to-coast investigation of the $ 150-million <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing system, code-named `` Operation Ill Wind,'' centers of allegations that companies paid private consultants to illegally obtain information about lucrative contracts. Prosecutors based much of their information on telephone wire taps.

 <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s governor, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, and its only congresswoman, <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, exchanged marriage vows Friday in a private ceremony attended by about 100 friends and relatives. `` It was wonderful,'' <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> said as the newlyweds chatted briefly with reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of the Holy Trinity. <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> is of Greek descent. `` We walked around the table four times _ we did it so well, we did it an extra time,'' <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> said, jocularly referring to the ceremonial walk that is part of the traditional wedding ritual. No governor and member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have ever married while both were in office, according to records checked by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The ceremony in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, adjacent to <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, consummated a romance they have quietly maintained for a decade Uniformed and plainclothes state troopers guarded the couple's privacy at the entrance to the gray church on a suburban hilltop About two dozen reporters and photographers waited outside in freezing temperatures, although one still photographer and one TV photographer were allowed inside immediately at the conclusion of the ceremony. `` Wish it could be a little warmer for you,'' <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> told reporters as she arrived promptly at 4 p.m. The governor had arrived five minutes earlier. `` Am I on time?'' he asked. The newlyweds planned to return to the <ORGANIZATION> Blaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the governor's mansion 30 miles from <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, for a private reception for wedding guests Friday evening. Later Friday night, weather permitting, they planned to fly on a friend's plane to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a honeymoon weekend. After that, they will travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> plans to attend a national governors conference and <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> will tend to her congressional duties. About 7,500 people have been invited to a March 4 reception at the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>; the $ 10,000 tab will be covered by leftover funds from <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>'s last campaign. At the <ORGANIZATION> Blaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the couple received cards by the hundreds and gifts by the dozen, according to the governor's social secretary, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartram </PERSON>. Most of the gifts came from personal friends and family, but a few were received from strangers who were moved by news of the nuptials. One woman sent the governor a copy of a book that her husband had written before he died; a second woman sent <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> three crocheted doilies. `` She just said she admires him,'' <PERSON> Bartram </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, 40, was divorced from his first wife in 1978. <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, 42, was widowed in 1973 when her first husband was killed in a car crash. The governor has an 18-year-old son. The two met as <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and served together as the state's two representatives in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s. <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON> was elected governor in 1986 after two terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON> is completing her sixth term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 A casino owner was fined $ 1.5 million Friday for displaying Nazi memorabilia and throwing parties on <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birthday, state gaming officials said The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> also placed nine conditions on <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s gaming license, including provisions prohibiting such parties and any displays that would glorify <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The agency filed a two-count complaint against <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> Dec. 8 citing the collection and parties. He also was cited for allegedly destroying records pertaining to a pending civil lawsuit. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> had faced possible license revocation on the various charges, but gaming officials said they worked out a compromise to get the controversial issue settled. The agreement included an apology by <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>. He refused comment after a two-hour hearing before the state <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, defended his client's actions and said they were done in private But <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> contended the fine was appropriate because <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> had damaged the reputation of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and its gaming industry. <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said the action should be a warning that the gaming board `` cares about <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s image and will take swift action,'' including license revocation if similar circumstances arise with other licensees. The agreement capped weeks of negotiations between <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s attorneys and the attorney general's office <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> defended the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> birthday parties on April 20 in 1986 and 1988, saying they were conducted for crews who worked on the restoration of Nazi-era cars that were to be used in one of <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s automobile displays. He said his case, if it had proceeded before the commission, would have involved the issues of free speech and right to privacy. <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> has said previously his actions were in poor taste and apologized at the time the incidents were made public The parties took place in a private room at the Strip resort, near a collection of antigue cars that is open to the public daily. He said he planned to put the multimillion-dollar collection of Nazi-era memorabilia on public display, and believed it represented an important chapter in history.

<HEAD>Group Says Kids Face Cancer Risk from Chemicals on Fruit, Vegetables</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A private environmental group contends in a new report that preschool children are consuming cancer-causing chemicals in fruits and vegetables at levels that expose them to health risks many times greater than the government considers safe. The findings by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> were immediately challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which said in a statement Friday that health risks to children are taken into account when setting allowable chemical residue levels. The <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group specializing in environmental and health matters that has criticized government policy in numerous areas, is scheduled to announce its findings at a news conference Monday. An executive summary of the report was obtained Friday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>, one of the authors, declined to comment on the two-year study except to say, `` Our work definitively shows there is a greatly increased risk to children from chemicals in their diets.'' The study, according to the summary, concludes that preschoolers are at an increased risk because they consume many times more in fruits and vegetables than adults relative to their weight and are more vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals. The summary said the authors had concluded, after analyzing consumption data and allowable residues of eight carcinogenic chemicals on 27 fruits and vegetables, that as many as 5,500 to 6,200 youngsters among the current population of preschoolers `` may eventually get cancer solely as a result of their exposure -LRB- to the chemicals -RRB- before six years of age.'' This represents, the report continued, a risk of at least five people in 20,000 getting cancer because of their exposure before the age of 6 years, much higher than the one in one million considered allowable by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in its risk analysis formula. Critics of the study said it raises false fears among parents. `` It's voodoo statistics. This has nothing to do with the realities of disease,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. There `` is no evidence of even one case of human cancer in children and adults being linked to exposure to the minute pesticide residues in food,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON> in a telephone interview. She maintained there are greater health risks in not using the pesticides. The environmental group's study concludes that the typical preschooler receives four times greater exposure on average than adult women to eight carcinogenic pesticides the group evaluated and that in some cases the increased exposure is as much as 18 times that of adults. `` Our nation's children are being harmed by the very fruits and vegetables we tell them will make them grow up healthy and strong,'' concludes the report summary. The group's conclusions were based on fruit and vegetable consumption figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and on levels of pesticide residues found on 27 fruits and vegetables according to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, the study said. Preschoolers eat six times as much fruit in general, seven times as much grapes, apples and apple sauce and 18 times as much apple juice as an adult, the study said. It said that half of all fruits sampled by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 `` had detectable levels of pesticides.'' In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the agency `` is concerned about potentially higher pesticide exposure to children and infants,'' but that it takes those concerns into account when determining levels of pesticides that are allowed on food. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> deputy administrator, said in an interview, however, that the agency does not agree with some of its critics that it should across the board `` add another potency factor in addition to what we use to accommodate the fact that kids are exposed more'' to certain foods containing some level of pesticides. He added that the agency's chemical tolerance levels for fruits and vegetables `` is designed to protect the average person against any short or long-term harmful effects that might result from an entire lifetime of exposure to pesticide residues in food, including exposure during childhood.'' The private group's study saw exposure to daminozide, a growth regulator, as posing the greatest risk to children among the carcinogenic chemicals they examined with a potential cancer risk to preschoolers of 1 case in every 4,200 people exposed. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> recently said it plans to order the product, which is used on apples, off the market and the producers of processed apple products have said for the most part it is no longer is being used by their industry.

<HEAD>Board Recommends Bush Block Eastern Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal agency recommended Friday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intervene and block a strike planned next week by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> mechanics and ground personnel, an administration official said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> name a presidential emergency board to investigate the protracted dispute, said presidential spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, accompanying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a three-nation trip to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accepted the recommendation it would automatically delay the strike, schedule to begin March 4, by 60 days. `` It's under review,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said of the recommendation. He said the president will consult with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and Justice departments before deciding. An earlier order blocking a strike expires at midnight March 3, in effect imposing a deadline of midnight next Friday for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to act. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> approves the recommendation, the union will be restrained from striking during a 30-day investigation and a follow-on 30-day cooling off period. The mediation board made the recommendations after a final round of mediation with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> failed to produce a settlement in the 16-month dispute, the sources said. Attempts to reach board officials Friday after word of the recommendation surfaced were unsuccessful. But grounds for recommending such a panel include a finding that a strike probably would cause an emergency in the affected industry. Labor leaders have been urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in the dispute, which centers on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s demands for $ 150 million a year in annual concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. The union contends <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to destroy the airline and incorporate most of its operations into non-union <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> property. `` I would hope the president would accept the board's recommendation for the good of the workers and the good of the airline,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said when informed of the mediation board's recommendation Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>, asked for the airline's reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> NMB </ORGANIZATION> recommendation referred to a Tuesday letter to the board from <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for human resources, who was responding to reports the board was leaning toward asking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene. `` This course of action as the effect of almost totally underming the negotiations,'' the letter said. `` Is the <ORGANIZATION> NMB </ORGANIZATION> trying to create an atmosphere for an agreement or do the bidding for one side? ... There is no precedent for this action in the airline industry.'' The letter said there was no evidence interstate commerce would be disrupted during a strike, grounds for presidential intervention under the Railway-Labor Act. Several labor leaders familiar with labor laws said it is unprecedented for a president to ignore recommendations from the mediation board to name an emergency panel. Such boards have 60 days to review the dispute and to make contract proposals. If the board's final offer is rejected the panel can submit it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which then can enter the contract-writing business by imposing the proposal on both sides in the dispute.

<HEAD>Official Says Program Being Scaled Back Because So Few Applying For
Asylum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BAYVIEW, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>

 So few people are applying for political asylum under a tough new one-day procedure that the immigration service has scaled back the extra staff it brought in to start the program, an official said Friday. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said the dropping numbers indicate the program is succeeding in discouraging `` frivolous'' applications. The agency maintains that most asylum-seekers are here for economic reasons, and are not fleeing persecution, a requirement for obtaining refugee status. Twenty-six asylum examiners will be sent home by Monday, said <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> assistant district director for examinations. One of the two <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel on hand to issue advisory opinions returned home Thursday, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> added. `` They are subject to recall, but it's just not cost-effective to have them here with the numbers that are showing up, or should I say not showing up,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, who oversees the adjudication process. A total of 50 examiners have been on duty here since Tuesday under a new policy in which asylum-seekers face immediate jailing, detention and deportation proceedings if their cases are denied. More of the 24 case examiners remaining after Monday and part of the clerical staff also may be sent back home if the number of applicants remains extremely low, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> reported it processed 233 asylum applications Tuesday, the first day of the get-tough procedure. Only two people were granted asylum that day. Of 51 applications submitted Wednesday, none was approved. The number of applicants dropped to 10 Thursday, all of whom were rejected and detained. Of the 19 processed Friday, a 20-year-old Nicaraguan student was the only one granted asylum. `` I understand he is active in a political party and had been in prison for his political beliefs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kice </PERSON>. Single adults face detention here at the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>' minimum-security Port Isabel Service Processing Center. Family groups are sent to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, where they must report for daily <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> roll calls or face deportation proceedings in absentia. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said Monday the program was designed to discourage the tens of thousands of Central Americans pouring across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> illegally in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> over the past year. More than 40,000 have applied for asylum in the area since last May, when the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> noted a dramatic upsurge in immigration from that region. Until recently, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> was seeing 2,000 or more Central American asylum applicants weekly at its <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> at the southern tip of the state. Immigration advocates opposed to the new program said the immigrants simply have gone underground, and will take their chances of apprehension by the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. Those apprehended may pursue asylum in immigration courts. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> said it was too early to declare the new program a success, but added, `` I have received reports ... that the word is out throughout <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and even groups in the pipeline have turned around and gone back.''

<HEAD>FAA Proposes $801,000 Fine Against Northwest For Violations</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> proposed a $ 801,000 fine against <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Friday for violations including the use of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jets on 8,198 flights without a required engine bolt inspection. The airline was also charged with making unauthorized repairs on two 747s and failure to comply with a dozen other <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules and directives. The airline has 15 days to respond to the civil penalty. The proposed fine amounts to a settlement offer from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> which will take effect if the airline does not object. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it first outlined the alleged violations in a Feb. 17 letter to Northwest President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president for operations, described the problems as primarily `` instances of inadequate record keeping and differences in interpretation.'' <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> said none of the issues questions the safe operation of airliners belonging the Minneapolis-based airline. He said the airline had completed original required inspections but had not accomplished `` repetitive follow-up inspections.'' He said discussion between the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> over the past year had reduced the number of alleged violations from 139 to a dozen and the airline would continue to discuss the remaining matters with federal authorities. `` Our objective is to ensure <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> is adhering to all federal aviation regulations,'' <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> said, noting that other <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> fines against airlines had ranged from $ 252,000 to $ 9.5 million. One case in the latest proposed penalty involved <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> failing to comply with an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> `` airworthiness directive'' for inspecting engine pylon attach bolts on 24 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s while continuing to fly the planes, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Although after-the-fact checks did not disclose any defects in the bolts, these 8,198 flights constituted violations of safety regulations because the airline did not do the inspections in the specified time frame,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The unauthorized repairs were on flap panels and horizontal and vertical stabilizers on two 747s, the agency said. It said other allegations included improperly deferring maintenance and flight crew over-scheduling. The problems were discovered during a month-long, in-depth <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection of the airline in January and February 1988 as part of a national safety inspection program, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. It published a 100-page report on the inspections in March, which included praise of <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> for conducting its own internal audit which led to several changes in company practices before the start of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection.

 At F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the sweaters are on sale, jelly beans are two bags for a dollar and the gun of the month is an M-1 semi-automatic carbine. It's no toy, and City Councilor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Scondras </PERSON> wants the department store and other stores to stop selling assault weapons. `` <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s is viewed as a wholesome American store, every kid in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> knows about <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s,'' <PERSON> Scondras </PERSON> said Friday. `` When you say it's OK to sell something at <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s then it sends a message ... It sanctions the buying and selling of assault weapons,'' he said. The high number of gun-related deaths in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s neighborhoods along with the easy availability of assault weapons has led <PERSON> Scondras </PERSON> and nine other council members to introduce a measure that would outlaw the sale of assault weapons in the city. The council has 13 members. `` It'll be brought to a vote before the end of March. By April they wo n't be selling them,'' he said. The measure would not ban standard handguns. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, have banned military-style, semi-automatic assault weapons recently in the aftermath of the killing of five elementary students in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>. Last month, a man used an assault rifle to spray a schoolyard with 100 bullets within two minutes. Ordinances banning the weapons have also been introduced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroux </PERSON>, manager of the downtown store who refused to comment on <PERSON> Scondras </PERSON>' complaints, said several other <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s stores sell firearms Telephone calls to the company's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters were not returned Friday. `` Gun of the Month'' has long been a feature in the <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s sporting goods department, located across from the children's section and upstairs from the pet shop, where finches were marked down below half-price The M-1 carbine, a smaller, lighter version of the .30 - caliber rifle of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in World War II, was on sale for $ <PERSON> Scondras </PERSON> also was disturbed by a bolt-action rifle with a bayonet on display at the store. `` You're not going to tell me that when you're selling a bayonet and a military weapon, and all this military imagery, you're selling -LRB- hunting gear -RRB-,'' he said. `` You're pushing a fantasy for Rambo.'' <PERSON> Giroux </PERSON> said the bayonet was removed after the councilor's complaints were publicized <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s sports department sells fishing gear, bows and arrows, bowie knives, shotguns and a limited variety of other rifles, but no handguns. Assault weapons `` are n't appealing to recreational sports, they're appealing to Rambo,'' <PERSON> Scondras </PERSON> said. `` We've been sending this wrong message for a long time, that you deal with your problems by blowing away your enemies.''

 Republicans hung tough Friday on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s troubled nomination to be <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary, with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saying from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, `` there is no fallback, there is no option,'' to the controversial appointment `` I'll be talking to whoever has an open mind on this subject,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in vowing a personal lobbying campaign upon his return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early next week. The president said he was not questioning the motivation of key <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats who have opposed the Tower nomination. The nomination, rejected on an 11-9 party-line vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, goes before the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later next week. `` I would n't be in a fight if I did n't think we could win it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in remarks to reporters shortly before leaving <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Saturday morning, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> time. Tower has been battling allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing, as well as questions about possible conflict of interest stemming from the hundreds of thousands of dollars he earned as a defense consultant earlier in the decade. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said many opponents had noted perceptions of Tower's problems, and added, `` That's not a fair enough, not a high enough standard. Earlier <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said, `` I stand strongly behind'' the appointment and arranged for a personal lobbying campaign when he returns home. Suggestions from majority Democrats that Tower withdraw and avert a bruising battle between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> next week were brushed aside. Tower met at the White House with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for a strategy session, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said afterwards there was no talk of a possible withdrawal. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be meeting individually next week with 10 or so potential <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> supporters in hopes of salvaging the nomination. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, meaning that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must pick up at least five Democrats to assure Tower's confirmation. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he believed all 45 Republicans were behind Tower. In his Friday remarks in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I want them -LRB- senators -RRB- to know how strongly I feel. And I feel it's not a personal win or lose, it's what's right, who is best to run the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. And that's what's at stake. And I'm going to win this battle.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also said the White House is at work preparing a summary of the confidential <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> file on Tower that can be released to the public in hopes of demonstrating that allegations him are baseless. The committee roll call transformed what had been a debate over Tower's fitness into a fierce partisan battle over a president's right to pick the members of his own Cabinet, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> made clear the stakes involved for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` This is the president's first controversial vote and I think he has a right to expect all of us to support him,'' he said of the Republicans. At the same time he said, `` I hope there's no party effort to line up every Democrat against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>.'' He said a pitched partisan battle could `` be an end to the honeymoon for both <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> _ the president and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, D-Maine.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said in a statement he has not decided how to vote, adding that whatever the outcome, `` I sincerely hope that we can continue to work with the administration'' on the nation's problems. Despite the fighting words from Republicans, one conservative Democrat said `` it would be best'' if Tower withdrew. `` Difficult and controversial decisions will have to be made at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> during the next four years,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. `` When controversial decisions have to e implemented, it becomes even more difficult when the decision maker himself is controversial for other reasons. We need a defense secretary that can garner more unified support.'' One Democrat on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list of possible votes is Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Another was Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who introduced his former colleague warmly at his confirmation hearing several weeks ago. Both men told reporters they were undecided on the nomination and would make up their minds after reading the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. Administration officials also contacted Sen. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, a liberal Democrat from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, to meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. One official noted that Tower was been one of only five senators _ and one of only two Republicans _ to vote against a resolution censuring <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s father, Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, in 1967 A spokesman for <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said he was undecided. Some Democrats were clearly hoping the nomination would n't come to a floor vote. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, who said he has n't made up his mind, issued a statement calling on Tower to withdraw. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> said after casting his committee vote that withdrawal would be wise and predicted swift confirmation for a replacement nominee. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, at a breakfast meeting with reporters, said he was n't suggesting withdrawal But he said he was certain that `` the president will consider all the possible options, including that one,'' and added that a replacement nominee would probably be confirmed `` in a relatively short period of time.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't hear of it. `` I stand strongly with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>,'' he told reporters. `` He is my choice, my only choice, and I am standing with him.''

 Only five weeks into the new presidency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is teaching the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration a painful lesson. It does n't pay to get into a fight with the folks who set interest rates. Since taking office, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been suggesting the Fed not choke off the economic expansion by pushing interest rates higher. The president got the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s response Friday. And it was just the opposite of what he had hoped to hear. The central bank raised its discount rate, the fee it charges for loans to commercial banks, to 7 percent, its highest level in three years. A boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the board can send of its intentions to push a broad range of interest rates higher in an effort to slow an overheated economy. Three times since Jan. 20, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has brushed away worries about inflation and said he did n't see the need for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to give the economy a dose of tighter credit. Rather, he said, the central bank should worry more about economic growth because he did not see signs that inflation was getting out of hand. Those comments were echoed Thursday by the administration's chief economic spokesman, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who said central bank policy-makers were anticipating too much. He likened the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to combat inflation by raising interest rates to shooting at a duck. `` When you're aiming at a duck, you can miss it. You can aim too much ahead of it or too much behind it,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said, adding that the administration would like the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to `` aim a little closer to it.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> did not even try to sugarcoat the message by adding, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had, that he did not believe he and the central bank were all that far apart. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to drive that point home again during a news conference Friday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where he was concluding the first leg of an Asian tour before heading to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Answering reporters questions, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged that he and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, differ somewhat on the question of the threat of a resurgence of inflation. `` We talked about this,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He was more concerned'' about the most recent consumer price figures, which showed inflation increasing at an annual rate of more than 7 percent a year. `` But I do n't think you can make a judgment on one months' figures,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` But look, if he's right on inflation, his concerns, if they're a little more than mine, we should be alert to that.'' The president went on to say that he and <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> have `` got a little difference of interpretation, now, as to how you read the indicators on inflation.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` that's the only difference we've got.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not like to see interest rates rising, and said that `` this argues even more forcefully than I've been able to argue that we need to be able to get an agreement'' with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a new fiscal 1990 budget that meets deficit-reduction targets. While disputes between the central bank and a president are not uncommon, some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were taken aback by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s apparent disregard for the threat of inflation, especially given the barrage of bad news on the price front in recent weeks Labor costs, wholesale prices and consumer prices have all been headed higher. The government reported Wednesday that retail prices shot up at their fastest pace in two years last month, an annual rate of 7.2 percent, almost double the 4.4 percent increase recorded in 1988. `` I'm disappointed that the administration is not more serious about this problem,'' Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, lectured <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> during his appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. What concerns many observers is that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may be forced to boost interest rates higher and more quickly than it had intended to dispell doubts in financial markets about the central bank's resolve to fight inflation because of the administration's verbal sniping. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> strategist and close friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has gone out of his way to emphasize the central bank's political independence even though he and the other six board members were all appointed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Recognizing the dangers of a public dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> took the unusual step on Friday of telling his colleagues in the administration to cool it. He said disputes between an administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> were `` extremely unhelpful'' adding, `` It tends to be unsettling to the -LRB- financial -RRB- markets, unsettling to foreigners and confusing to people who are trying to plan and none of those things is good for the economy.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s unspoken fear is that foreigners, who finance an increasing share of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s borrowing needs, might suddenly decide to dump their dollar-denominated assets because of fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had responded to political pressure and abandoned its inflation-fighting campaign. Many economists believe such a `` dollar strike'' is the most likely way the next recession will be triggered. Fears about the intentions of foreign investors helped trigger Black Monday, the 508-point drop in the stock market of October 1987. With the increase in the discount rate, the central bank hopes to demonstrate its resolve and keep the economy headed toward a soft landing, the process whereby gradual increases in interest rates are enough over time to slow economic demand and thus relieve inflationary pressures. Many economists believe the process will work. They note that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credit tightening has already boosted short-term interest rates by around 3 percentage points since March, when the tightening began. They predict overall growth should begin slowing significantly by this spring. If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is successful, the economic recovery, already at a peacetime record of six years, will keep steaming ahead. But if inflation keeps rising and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is forced to clamp down even tighter, then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s worst fears of a recession could come true.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s diplomatic debut on the world stage has been soured and his new administration has been thrown on the defensive by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee's rejection of his choice of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be defense secretary. And if that were n't enough, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got more bad news from home during his Far East tour Friday when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> boosted its key discount rate to dampen inflationary pressures. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been arguing that there is not enough inflation to justify higher interest rates. With leaders of more than 160 nations assembled here for the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the politically embarrassing news of Tower's rebuff by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was splashed across the front pages of Japanese newspapers. Back in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, television viewers saw reporters bombarding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> with questions about Tower's troubles, not the president's talks with foreign leaders All in all, it was n't the kind of script the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would have written for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first overseas journey as president, although at a news conference in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Saturday morning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to downplay his disagreement with <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, and he disputed that the Tower problem had cast a cloud on his trip. The president said he and <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> have `` got a little difference of interpretation, now, as to how you read the indicators on inflation,'' but, `` that's the only difference we've got.'' As to Tower? `` I think people that are serious students of foreign policy and are interested in foreign policy objectives are not going to view this trip in the context of a flap over the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> nomination. I think there's much more serious points in foreign policy to be made. `` And if it's beclouded by some political battle back home right now, so be it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The selection of Tower has been a festering problem for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, even before the nomination was announced in January. There have been repeated questions about excessive drinking, womanizing and possible conflict of interest involving defense contractors. Dismissing the allegations as rumor and gossip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has steadfastly defended Tower and taken the political heat. `` I'm going to strongly continue to back Sen. Tower and I do not believe he is going down the drain,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He vowed to carry the fight to salvage the nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was on the telephone to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> throughout the night trying to devise a workable strategy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made some calls to influential senators, but to no avail. The 11-9 vote against <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, split solidly along party lines with the Democrats holding the edge, dealt a blow to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the song of bipartisan cooperation he has been singing since his inauguration a month ago. Putting the best possible face on the situation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` The honeymoon's still going fine and I'm not going to get total agreement on every issue.'' However, he acknowledged that considering he wants Tower confirmed as his <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> chief, `` I ca n't say it's a pat on the back.'' Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said it would be a `` kick in the teeth'' to the president if the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected Tower Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, said the committee's party-line vote against <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> would make it harder to forge a bipartisan defense policy. Here for the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the president held separate talks over the last two days with the leaders of 17 nations. By all appearances, the sessions went off without a hitch, although the stakes did not seem very high. In advance of the trip, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> had said the meetings would not delve into substantive issues, nor would they yield any decisions. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the problem with Tower did not come up in any of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meetings. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> acknowledged that Tower's difficulties were hurting the administration. `` It is not in the best interest of foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have a nomination hang fire for this long,'' the secretary of state said. `` It's very difficult to proceed when you do n't have one of your major national security players in place.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not willing to play hardball politics with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and blame anyone at this early stage for fouling things up. In particular, he said he had no problem with Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> chairman who singled out Tower's drinking record as a good reason for rejecting him `` I have no acrimony and I'm not going to be drawn into name-calling or a political accusation here,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to do that. I've got to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a lot of issues. But I want them to know how strongly I feel. `` And I feel it's not a personal win or lose, it's what's right, who is best to run the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' the president said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday he did n't question whether it was right for him to be there while attending the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, but he admitted having memories of fighting the Japanese in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't say that in the quiet of the ceremony that my mind did n't go back to the wonder of it all,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a news conference. `` I vividly remember the personal friends that were in our squadron that are no longer alive, ... but my mind did n't dwell on that at all.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the youngest pilot in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> when he was commissioned, was shot down by Japanese gunners on Sept. 2, 1944, during a bombing attack on Chichi Jima. His two crew members were killed and he was rescued by a passing American submarine. There had been criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for attending the funeral of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the last of the World War II leaders to die. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his thoughts had `` nothing to do about whether it was right to be here. ... And perhaps having been in combat in World War II, maybe the decision was more correct, maybe it was more profound to be here. ... I'm representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` We're talking about a friend, we're talking about an ally,'' he said.

 A man called a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> radio station last month threatening to bomb an American plane unless a jailed member of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was released by Friday, a station spokesman said. Japanese police said the terrorist group probably would not attack an American target. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Oshita </PERSON>, general manager of the radio station <ORGANIZATION> KOHO </ORGANIZATION>, said the caller on Jan. 23 demanded the freedom of <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON> and asked that the message be relayed to the Japanese Consulate in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The caller, who spoke in Japanese, hung up without identifying himself. <PERSON> Oshita </PERSON> said he relayed the message to the consulate and later was interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators said there was no indication that a bomb caused the hole in the fuselage of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811, which made an emergency landing in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> after nine people were sucked out of the plane and killed. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official said Saturday it was `` not realistic to assume the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was responsible'' for the incident. Police here said last month they feared the Lebanon-based <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> might attack Japanese embassies abroad to disrupt the funeral Friday of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> or to press for the release of <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensui </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> member detained in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maruoka </PERSON> was arrested last November. He was wanted in connection with a 1972 attack at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lod </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in which 26 people were killed, and the hijacking of a jetliner over <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1977. The Japanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> wanted to pressure the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> government, it probably would have chosen a target more closely related to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Japanese people than an American aircraft flying from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. He also said that if the plane was bombed, `` I do n't think -LRB- the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- would actually explode the bomb so easily. ... Once it explodes, they ca n't use it for bargaining any more.'' He said Japanese authorities were aware of the threat to the Hawaiian radio station.

 A 12-year-old boy was in custody Friday night in connection with the fatal shooting of his mother and the wounding of his father in their home, police said. The boy, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON>, had apparently gotten into trouble earlier in the day at school in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D, C., suburb and argued with his mother, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON>, before she was shot three times with a .22 caliber rifle, police said. Moments later, the boy's father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON>, returned home early from his job as a medical researcher and was also shot, police said. He managed to call police before staggering outside and collapsing, they said. <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON> was shot three times and was listed in fair condition at <LOCATION> Suburban </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON> entered the home through the back door, he was unaware that his wife had been shot, said police spokesman <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Geehreng </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON> then saw his wife's body on the kitchen floor and his son, holding the rifle and standing in a nearby basement stairwell. The boy opened fire from the stairwell and continued shooting as he followed his father through the kitchen and outside on the back porch, <PERSON> Geehreng </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON> was apparently cooking dinner when the shooting occurred. Two other Nupp children, a 7-year-old boy and a 3-year-old, were in the home at the time of the shooting, police said. When police arrived, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON> was in the basement, but he came out the back door without the gun and surrendered, police said. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON> was being questioned, but had not yet been charged. One unanswered question was whether he would be charged an adult with murder or handled as a juvenile. The family kept three guns in the house, but <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nupp </PERSON> told police he believed all the weapons had been locked in the attic.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his visit to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> distracted by the imperiled nomination of Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, bade farewell to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new emperor Saturday and said his introductory talks with foreign leaders `` laid some good groundwork'' for maintaining global peace. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Haneda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One, on a more than four-hour flight to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, at midday. A heavy rain fell as the Boeing-707 jet took off. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was looking forward to a nostalgic return to his former diplomatic post in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But first he grappled with questions concerning Tower and summed up his two days in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Throughout all of our disscussions ... I found a shared sense of satisfaction ... that East-West relations are now clearly proceeding on the basis of an agenda favorable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its allies, its friends,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. In discussions with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> and European leaders, as well as leaders of third-world nations such as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We've laid some good groundwork here.. ... and that will help us as we go down the road. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that during his trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he will bring up human rights, but said he has no specific cases to press with his hosts. The president revealed that he will will meet in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, as well, with <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes that <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> should head an interim government once Vietnamese troops complete their pullout of forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> later this year. He also reiterated American opposition to a return to power by the Chinese-supported <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. He defended Tower again in his session with reporters, saying he had no `` fallback'' planned except to lobby strongly with `` whoever has an open mind on the subject.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will take up the Tower nomination shortly after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s return from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> next week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was arriving in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at mid-day <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> time, 3:30 a.m. EST <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> time. `` Both countries have come so far since my stay in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in written responses to questions posed by <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news agency. The remarks were released by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> prepared to leave for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the world remained `` a tumultuous, dangerous place,'' but said he was optimistic. `` I would say that any man with 11 grandchildren is a cautious optimist by definition. He has a big stake in the future.'' On <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has some big differences'' with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on some issues, but said he wanted to travel there to show the Chinese leaders that he will never take them for granted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that `` we've passed the day'' of confining Sino-American relations to discussions limited to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s security interests alone. `` The relationship's strong and I'd like to strengthen it,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Asian tour so far has been distracted by the burgeoning battle with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, the president earlier sought to stress the primary reason for his visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral. During his nearly half-hour exchange with reporters gathered in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence here, the president also: _ He and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> have `` a little difference of interpretation'' of economic indicators relating to inflation <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he does not like seeing interest rates raised _ as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> did in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday _ and said he believes there will be less pressure on interest rates if he and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agree on a fiscal 1990 budget that meets the $ 100 billion deficit-reduction target. _ Said that in his talks with <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> leaders, he `` made clear the continuing readiness'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` facilitate this process'' in a way is consistent with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security interests and `` positive developments'' in the Arab world <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has kept open the low-level contacts that then-President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> established with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> late last year. _ Admitted that while attending the funeral services for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, he had thoughts of his shooting down over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> by the Japanese during World War II, but said that he `` did n't dwell on that at all. `` ... Perhaps having been in combat in World War II, maybe the decision -LRB- to come to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> -RRB- was more correct,'' he said. `` Maybe it was more profound to be here. I'm representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We're talking about a friend. We're talking about an ally.'' He said the <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> funeral was `` beautifully staged and beautifully carried out.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met briefly at the Imperial Palace with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s new emperor, <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, before sitting down separately with Presidents <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, bringing to 20 the number of foreign leaders he has met with in two days of fast-paced diplomacy here. In his remarks to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news agency, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared that `` the one constant in today's world is change. For the most part, the direction of change is positive from the standpoint of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s values and interests. `` Let me say that I certainly agree that the current state of our relationship is healthy,'' he said. He vowed to work for increased trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and pledged `` to keep up the dialogue between our two governments on political issues of mutual concern,'' which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> listed as global peace, easing of regional conflicts, arms control, and combating drugs, terrorism and threats to the environment. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hoped that a recent easing of tensions between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could be accelerated. But he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains committed to keeping troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which he will visit on Monday on his way home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It would be far too optimistic, at this point, where the deterrence provided by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is no longer needed,'' he said. During his two days in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is slated to hold one-on-one sessions with the nation's top four leaders, discuss matters ranging from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to trade, and even host a Texas-style barbecue. In <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, he vowed continued strong support for a proposed $ 200 million in aid to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation contained in budgets submitted by both himself and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also `` reiterated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for her government and for democracy in that country,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also met with <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>, Belgian King <PERSON> Baudouin </PERSON>, Turkish Prime Minister <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, Italian President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON>. In addition, the president and his wife had dinner with King <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and his queen, <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> held a separate session Friday with Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> that included a discussion of a controversial proposed joint venture to build the FSX jet aircraft. Although the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration approved the agreement for Japanese-U.S. construction on a new version of the F-16 fighter, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is reassessing the proposal. According to <PERSON> Yukio </PERSON> <PERSON> Okamato </PERSON>, an official with the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> foreign ministry, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> voiced hope `` for a smooth implementation of the agreement as soon as possible.''

 Church bells rang out across this island nation Saturday as Filipinos celebrated the third anniversary of the overthrow of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But the lingering discord here was plain to see. About 3,000 <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters marched Saturday demanding their ousted leader's return from Hawaiian exile. The military said a soldier and his wife were arrested in a van packed with explosives headed toward the site where President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was to speak later in the day. The military also said an officer was placed under restrictions in southeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> for purported links to renegade Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, leader of the August 1987 attempt to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. Filipinos awaited the return of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where she attended the funeral of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, to take part in festivities marking the climax of the `` people power'' uprising that propelled her to office. The main celebrations were planned on <PERSON> Epifanio </PERSON> delos <LOCATION> Santos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, where hundreds of thousands of people turned out three years ago to protect military officers who mutinied against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said about 2,000 troops would provide security. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office on Feb. 25, 1986 and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Some prominent Filipinos who helped put her in power said they were boycotting the ceremonies because the Aquino government lacks direction. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the soldier and his wife were arrested about 9 p.m. Friday in <LOCATION> Taytay </LOCATION>, a few miles east of the celebration venue. He said the van was headed for <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` The implication is quite big,'' <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said. Asked if the explosives were meant for a new coup attempt, he said: `` We're trying to find out. Col. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> <PERSON> Filart </PERSON>, Philippine Constabulary regional commander for southeastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, said a police captain was placed under restrictions Friday in <LOCATION> Albay </LOCATION> province, 200 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, after admitting contacts with <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s group. <PERSON> Filart </PERSON> said the captain, whose name was not released, said <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s group asked him to join them but he refused. <PERSON> Filart </PERSON> said dissidents had been trying to recruit followers in his area. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was prominent in the anti-Marcos uprising, but then led a coup attempt against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Aug. 28, 1987. He escaped from custody in April. On Friday, about 10,000 leftists took to the streets to express their dissatisfaction with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, shouting anti-government slogans and burning a 10-foot papier mache effigy of the president. Masked youths burned tires and exploded firecrackers and rockets during Friday's six-hour protest. The rally took place at the <LOCATION> Mendiola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, about 300 yards from the presidential palace. Many of the disparate groups that rallied around Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, whose politics are centrist, have since fallen away. They include left-leaning activists who dreamed of social and economic reform and military officers who believe their revolt against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was taken over by old-style politicians in revolutionary guise. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s vision of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was the restoration of democratic institutions: <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal constitution and an independent judiciary. Critics say that was not enough in a country ravaged by poverty, social injustice and corruption. `` I will not join the celebrations because I think there is no cause for celebration,'' Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. `` They really wanted change for the country, but ... nothing is clear and our future is still dim.'' As defense minister, <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> led a mutiny against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on Feb. 22, 1986, that prompted civilians to fill the streets, protecting the mutineers from soldiers loyal to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> later turned against Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. She fired him as defense minister Nov. 23, 1986, after a failed coup by his followers. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, another key figure in the 1986 revolt, said Saturday the government had not had sufficient time to achieve all the revolution's goals. `` We should not be discouraged,'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> told reporters. `` We should not listen that our government is on the brink of collapse and that the Filipinos can not do it.'' Left-leaning activists say Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> tolerates military abuses of civil rights in the 20-year-old war against communist guerrillas and has not pressed land reform and other social programs. In a statement Thursday, the women's organization <PERSON> Gabriela </PERSON> claimed she had `` completely turned away from the people who installed her in power.'' <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Peace, said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had installed `` mere trappings'' of democracy.

 The tents were empty, the applications lay blank and all was quiet on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border today, but immigration authorities warned that thousands of Central Americans were `` lying low'' and hoping for a lapse in tighter federal restrictions. `` I do n't think they will stop coming,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bautista </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez-Sanchez </PERSON>, a Nicaraguan who was detained after his application for asylum was denied.

 People who smoke to control their weight are simply redistributing their fat and putting themselves at risk for potentially deadly illnesses, according to a study published today. Smoking does reduce weight, the researchers acknowledged, but flab stays around the waist, increasing the chance for heart disease, diabetes _ and early death. `` If you're a cigarette smoker who is continuing to smoke in order to control your body weight, or a non-smoker considering starting up again ... you're making a bad decision,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON>, a co-author of the study and clinical director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` There's no question that the risk of cigarette smoking is much greater than the risk of a few -LRB- excess -RRB- pounds of body weight,'' he said.

<HEAD>The Singularly Royal Appeal of ``Single Spies''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Midway through `` A Question of Attribution,'' a sudden hush falls over the audience. The unthinkable, it seems, has happened: Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has walked on stage. In fact, Her Majesty is actress Prunella Scales. But given the public awe in which the queen is held, turning her into a stage character is a daring ploy, unprecedented in mainstream British theater. `` A Question of Attribution,'' with `` An Englishman Abroad,'' are two plays by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> which, under the combined title `` Single Spies,'' have been a sellout since opening Dec. 1 at the government-subsidized National Theater. The show reopens Feb. 28 for a commercial run at, appropriately enough, the Queen's Theater. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON>, the erstwhile spy who worked as Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, and he is seen rearranging paintings in the Queen's Gallery at <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> when the monarch unexpectedly appears. `` If you do n't believe it's her, you ca n't suspend your disbelief,'' said Scales, 56. `` It gives one an extraordinary sense of power on stage because of the way they -LRB- the audience -RRB- listen.'' For there, capturing the queen's diction, bearing and demeanor, is the diminutive actress best-known as long-suffering <PERSON> Sybil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawlty </PERSON> opposite <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON> on the TV's wonderful `` Fawlty Towers,'' and the conniving Miss Mapp in `` Mapp and <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON>,'' based on the <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> novels. Scales admires <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s `` very cheeky bit of writing,'' but said she was determined not to caricature the queen. `` There are lots of people jolly good at imitating the queen rather better than me,'' she said. `` I thought it frightfully important that -LRB- the portrayal -RRB- be as real as possible.'' This <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> is drily and slyly witty, every bit the softspoken match for the singular spy in her midst. Blunt was unmasked in 1964 as a spy, the so-called `` fourth man'' alongside <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON>, all <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> classmates in the 1930s. In return for making a secret confession to his interrogators, he was spared punishment and public exposure, kept his job as the queen's art adviser and retired honorably in 1972. In 1979, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> publicly named him a spy, whereupon he was stripped of his knighthood. He died in 1983. It's not known whether the queen ever knew she was employing a traitor, but <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s play subtly hints that she can detect human forgeries as cannily as Blunt detects fake pictures. After `` 40 Years On,'' with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> as a schoolmaster, and the screenplays for two low-budget triumphs, `` A Private Function'' and `` Prick Up Your Ears,'' `` Single Spies'' confirms <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s stature in the top rank of British writers Meanwhile, TV viewers are being treated to a rerun of his `` Talking Heads,'' a remarkable series of monologues including <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> playing an alcoholic wife of a vicar, and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s own devastating portrayal of a mentally disturbed middle-aged man. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has used treason before to explore the English psyche in `` The Old Country,'' which cast <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> as an English defector living in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` An Englishman Abroad'' was first seen as a 1984 teleplay portraying the wretched life of another traitor, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, in exile in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It depicts an episode in which <PERSON> Coral </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, playing in `` Hamlet'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is visited backstage by <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, the drunk and maudlin `` Englishman Abroad.'' In the latest production, Scales plays <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Callow </PERSON> is <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>. Scales said both plays were `` about martyrdom, about people who suffer for their convictions,'' and stressed that playing Coral <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> offered distinct, but equal, challenges to playing the queen. `` With the Queen, you've got the tapes, the broadcasts and everything,'' said Scales. `` I wish Coral <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> were as well-documented.'' <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, 75, who starred most recently in the movie `` Dreamchild,'' saw `` Single Spies'' on its opening night. The queen, to date, has no plans for a visit. <PERSON> Felicity </PERSON> <PERSON> Murgo-Smith </PERSON>, a Palace spokeswoman, said: `` I ca n't possibly tell you whether she's seen it; we have no notes of her private visits The queen takes a great interest in what's going on in this country.'' <PERSON> Murgo-Smith </PERSON> said no permission was necessary for <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, or anyone else, to put the Royal Family on-stage: `` Stage censorship in this country finished some time back,'' she said.

<HEAD>United States Helps Rebuild Egyptian Mosques</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is helping to finance reconstruction of four mosques from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s rich Islamic past, in an effort to preserve the city's heritage. Egyptian and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said the $ 1.3 million project is miniscule by the standards of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, where it administers economic aid of more than $ 865 million. Only <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> gets more. But the three-year project to rebuild the historic mosques also unlocks the door to further use of American development money for <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s famous monuments. Often overshadowed by more famous pharaonic monuments, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s Islamic heritage is second to none But squeezed by an ever-expanding city and gutted from below by a rising water table, many of the 520 remaining Moslem monuments are in danger of crumbling. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> USAID </ORGANIZATION> director in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, did not rule out future allocations for antiquities. The project's chief architect, <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamei </PERSON> <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON>, said in order to do the job to his expectations, he needs much more money. `` I call these reconstructions rather than restorations, because so much work has to be done,'' he said. `` I could use three times as much money, but I'll do the best I can.'' <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> said the most challenging of the four mosques, al-Zahir Baybars al-Bunduqdari, is so decrepit that it accommodates fewer than three dozen worshippers for Friday prayers. When he finishes, he said, 10,000 to 12,000 will pray there. `` All the worshippers will be thanking the Americans for this,'' he said. The project's budget of 3 million Egyptian pounds comes from a `` host-country fund'' generated by sale of spare parts, machinery and raw materials brought from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the aid program for resale in local currency. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said both Egyptian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials must approve outlays from the fund, which usually totals about 700 million pounds -LRB- $ 304 million -RRB-. In an interview, he said the fund generally finances development projects. `` I think it seemed to us something that would seem symbolically to tell the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> people, ` Hey, the Americans are pretty sensitive to your historical and cultural past' and show -LRB- our -RRB- support for it,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the project originated in 1987 when <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wisner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON>, then chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that something should be done to restore the medieval historical part of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fahmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Abd-Alina </PERSON>, antiquities director for Islamic and Coptic monuments, said the Americans were given the names of the four most historic and important monuments that could benefit from financial aid. `` This is ... a great, large and difficult project that would have taken up too much of our own money if we had financed it. ... We're very grateful to the Americans,'' he said. Two of the mosques _ the early 16th-century <PERSON> Ghuriya </PERSON> and 15th-century al-Muayyad _ face a narrow, bustling thoroughfare leading from bazaar to bazaar in one of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s last medieval areas. Once a marketplace for exotica-laden camel caravans, the picturesque area provides the setting for the best-known works of <PERSON> Naguib </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahfouz </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature last year. The atmosphere beckons tourists seeking 1001 Arabian nights: covered alleys; donkey carts stacked with vegetables; street peddlers balancing on their heads loaves of fresh-baked bread and stalls where craftsmen stitch splotches of cloth into squares like those once used to assemble the great Arabian tents. Another mosque, built by the <PERSON> Mameluke </PERSON> <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaykhu </PERSON> in 1349, lies in a separate part of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> within sight of the Citadel of Crusader-fighter <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON>. The first reconstruction will be in the spring at <LOCATION> Baybars </LOCATION> mosque, in a business and residential area about a 15-minute car ride from downtown <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Pumps have been working for months to lower its water table before the reconstruction engineers can go to work. Dating from 1269, <PERSON> Baybars </PERSON> has a checkered history. It has housed a bakery, soap factory, abbatoir and stables. <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s troops used it as a fort, and later Ottoman Turks fired cannon from its ramparts against rebellious locals. Today, few in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> even recognize <PERSON> Baybars </PERSON> as a mosque. Taxi drivers call it `` the English slaughterhouse,'' because that's what <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> overlords used it for until early this century. <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> specializes in Islamic architecture and formerly taught at <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In preparation for the project, he has been studying plans left by workers who built <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s Islamic monuments, including 10th-century manuscripts left by Persian artisans, and drawings by traveling artists in the 1800s when much of the old was still alive. A major architectural challenge in <LOCATION> Baybars </LOCATION> will be to fashion a pine-wood dome covered with lead sheets to replace the missing original, which towered 60 feet from the floor. He hopes to gather enough strong wood from demolished houses to rebuild the dome. Wood for the original came from <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION> in what is now <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Baybars </PERSON> seized from the Crusaders in 1268. <PERSON> Baybars </PERSON>, one of the strongest Mameluke rulers, is said to have designed the enormous mosque himself to use as a rest house while playing polo on the grounds. He looted stone columns from monuments throughout <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for decoration.

 Soon it will be possible to make a TV program that makes fun of TV programs that make fun of TV, but <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s production company has found at least one more interesting and funny way to spoof its very own medium in `` What's Alan Watching?'' tonight on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> returns to television in a very funny cameo as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, but mostly his credit here is as executive producer. The hour-long sitcom combined with video sketches, `` What's <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Watching </PERSON>?'' is the first production of <ORGANIZATION> Eddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> in its deal with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. Well, so far, so good. It was written by former `` Saturday Night Live'' writers <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaustein </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheffield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Tischler </PERSON>. Woven through the sitcom premise is a satire of movies of the week, game shows, commercials, documentaries. A rapid montage of these is presented to 17-year-old <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffstedtter </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Corin </PERSON> `` Corky'' <PERSON> Nemec </PERSON> -RRB- who plops in front of the set with the remote when he wants to get away from the rest of his wacky family. First, there's older sister <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Drescher </PERSON> -RRB-, who mooches off mom and dad and waits for her divorce from <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> to become final so she can marry slobbish carpet-cleaning magnate, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kling </PERSON>, `` the Carpet King,'' -LRB- <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> -RRB- whose motto, which he often graphically demonstrates, is `` so clean you could eat off it.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> -RRB-, a <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION> salesman, is in love with his sleek 912 Turbo _ and any other material possession he can acquire. `` Did I tell you I'm thinking about getting a fax machine?'' he excitedly asks dad at dinner. Dad -LRB- <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> -RRB- is in the corrugated cardboard box business. He tries to explain to <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> why <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> is so mean by explaining `` sometimes a box comes off the assembly line a little skewed.'' `` That's why I love my dad,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> says in an aside, `` these incredible box analogies.'' Meanwhile, Mom -LRB- <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrie </PERSON> -RRB- teaches tap dancing to neighborhood youngsters. `` My parents tell me I watch television to escape,'' says <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> as a 7-year-old would-be hoofer wails `` Mammy'' in the living room. `` What would I possibly want to escape from?'' The sitcom plot manages to be very funny on one level, rather poignant on another. While mom and dad yearn to spend worry-free golden years at the sunny retirement village of their choice, the older kids regress, moving back home when they ca n't make it in the outside world. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON>, facing the uncertainties of a far-away college next year, is torn between going off to school and staying in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to be near his high-school heartthrob. When he escapes to the TV room, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> is regaled with an amazing array of video sketches that, when interspersed occasionally with actual clips of television shows, make the real things look like jokes. There's an ad for a hard-hitting news report on `` pit babies;'' a documentary on Mr. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>, complete with celebrity recollections, such as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s paean, `` While we were still telling jokes, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> was working conceptually;'' a commercial for an upcoming extravaganza _ `` Coming Sunday to the <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> _ it's ` Gandhi on Ice!''' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> makes a cameo appearance in heavy makeup as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> starring in a CBS movie of the week, `` Soul on the Rocks,'' in which <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> goes to prison, an apparently intentional reference to real life that allows <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, in a dual role as a protester, to chant, `` Free <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>!'' while moonwalking. Eventually, the people on television give <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> advice on what he should do. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smothers </PERSON> says go away to the big university. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> says stay in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The remote control leads <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> to `` Jeopardy!'' `` <PERSON> Alan </PERSON>'s Family for 400,'' says a contestant. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Trebek </PERSON> intones, `` A selfish cretin, he was kicked out of locksmith school when he could n't open his lunchbox.'' Correct question: `` Who is <PERSON> Alan </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON>?'' In keeping with the hipness of the hour, the surreal ending is very funny and thankfully leaves the end unpat _ perhaps suitable for a weekly series.

 If television gave awards for the most improved show of the season, this year's would have to go to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World'' and to producer <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> In its debut season last year, `` A Different World'' was ballyhooed as a spinoff of `` The Cosby Show,'' and slotted right behind that hit comedy, it produced huge ratings, frequently landing in first or second place in the Nielsens. Critically, though, it was a big yawn. The show was a vehicle for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonet </PERSON>, one of the `` Cosby'' kids packed off to college. The show was designed to appeal to younger audiences. `` I was brought in to turn it around,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who previously helped make `` Fame'' a hit in syndication. `` I was also to help with the morale problem on the set. People were unhappy. It was n't a company that had a central binding force. One of my main assignments was to make the show about something that was relevant.'' The most interesting character on the college campus was <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, a spoiled debutante played by <PERSON> Jasmine </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON>. This season, <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> got the limelight when <PERSON> Bonet </PERSON> became pregnant and left the show. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said she was sorry that <PERSON> Bonet </PERSON> had to leave and would welcome her back. `` I do n't think she'll be back,'' she said. `` She's had her baby and is getting used to being a mama.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said she was happy that the show had become good enough that the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had agreed that morning to appear on the show. His episode is to be taped in March for airing in April. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> also has a special on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> this Sunday and her first album, `` Special Look,'' is due out in April from <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>. `` So many exciting things are happening I'm getting on the Princess Di level,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who talked in her office at the CBS-MTM Studios where the show is filmed. `` Everything I've been working on for a long time is coming to fruition. My real forte is that I've been able to keep up with my own growth pattern. I have been consistently able to keep up with my ambitions, my talents and my abilities.'' When she was hired as producer-director of `` A Different World'' the first thing she did was review the physical look of the show and talk to the writers about the stories. `` I looked at the tape of every show,'' she said. `` I wanted to know what I was getting into. I took notes on everything. Then I came up with my own ideas, since I'm a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. I felt the show needed to be upgraded to a more mature level of talking and thinking. We could n't have a show about young people that did n't deal with the things going on in this country. Teen-age pregnancy, student uprisings, voting and other issues. `` We also added some new students. I wanted <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> to have a roommate so she would have to share. I also changed the makeup and hairstyles. I wanted the women students to look fresh. They looked too much like starlets in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. I wanted them to be more like real people.'' `` The Debbie Allen Special'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> this Sunday, stars <PERSON> Whoopi </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillaume </PERSON>, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Phylicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON>, who is <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s sister and plays <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>'s wife on `` The Cosby Show.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clippers </ORGANIZATION> basketball team, is co-executive producer and makes a brief appearance. `` I take a song from my album and put <PERSON> Phylicia </PERSON> in it,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` I make her wear a hot dress and move her body. She had men all around her, and she loved it. I do a number with <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> that is so hot. We had to send it to Standards and Practices for approval.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said she wrote the lyrics for three songs on her album. A video for the album is being developed.

<TEXT>
 Prices and interest rates are rising, economists are shaving their growth forecasts and many Americans are putting up the storm shutters, preparing for the economy's version of winter. But, while the portents are ominous, this is n't necessarily the prelude to winter, particularly so severe a winter as that which plagued the economy in the late 1970s and led to the deep-freeze recession of 1981-1982. There are some differences. There are even some encouraging breaks in the clouds, enough so that some observers remain convinced inflation is n't an immediate threat. Among them, it seems, are some in the White House. Moreover, while few economists would claim that a slowdown could be made without pain, a growing number seem to believe that future economic extremes can be constrained, and that pain need not be as intense as in the past. More and more of them talk about such things as `` rolling readjustments,'' in which recessions in some geographical areas are accompanied by good times in others, and downturns in some industries are offset by upturns in others. But aside from this broad factor, there are some specifics that lend encouragement. There remains, for example, a good deal of price competition in goods, as demonstrated by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION>'s plan for `` everyday low pricing,'' a policy under which tags on some items will be cut 50 percent. The car companies are competing, especially through rebates and subsidized interest rates. Moreover, inventories are sufficiently large to all but assure a continuation of this discounting through much of the spring and summer. If that is n't enough to keep some prices in line, then global competition might come into play. Long gone are the days when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies could ignore foreign competition. Now, overpricing means lost market share. Another factor, consumer resistance, is evident in various areas of the economy. For several years, for instance, it seemed there was no limit to increases in housing prices. Now, some asking prices are being cut. American production efficiency is still another factor. Billions of dollars have been spent on improved plant and equipment in recent years, and that means manufactured products are being turned out at relatively lower costs. Technological changes and ingenious software, for example, have vastly raised the power of small computers without equivalent increases in price. And those improvements are destined to continue, since high-tech investment is up. A changed work ethic now helps to reduce inflationary pressures. Wages in the past few years have been limited roughly to productivity increases, a contrast to the 1970s, when they outpaced productivity and fueled inflation. Still another factor that makes 1989 much different from a decade or so ago is the very manner in which the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has been acting. Rather than waiting for evidence of inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began its attack in advance. Way back in March 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> economists reasoned that the growing labor and industrial capacity shortages eventually would begin to force up prices, even if the evidence was not conclusive at the time. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> began raising rates. Ever since then it has had its foot on the brake, keeping the economy from roaring out of control. In effect, it has been muting the inflationary danger bit by bit rather than delaying action and being forced to come down harder. That was not the case in the early 1970s, when inflation thinking became so habitual that carmakers made no effort to hold down wages, confident they could pass on their expenses in higher prices. It took years to uproot that attitude. In contrast, today's <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has acted pre-emptively, attacking the inflation problem before it developed strongly, dosing it with high interest rates before it has had a chance to grow into a monster.

 Where drivers passing the maximum-security <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> State Prison see a grim, century-old building of hand-hewn granite blocks and iron window bars, Disney production people saw a set for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s next movie. They wanted a building with a forbidden look for `` Hard Rain,'' a story set in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison in the early 1900s. Producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cort </PERSON> and director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> considered about 60 prisons and visited 15 sites before deciding to film outdoor scenes at the prison, located on the outskirts of the state capital in the high desert of northwest <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> facility was chosen because it had two yards, and `` we could be guaranteed that their security would not interfere with our work and our work would n't interfere with their security,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>, the movie's unit publicist. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Holabird </PERSON>, deputy director of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s film office, said while the Disney movie is the most recent planned for the prison, her office receives a steady stream of requests for information and visits from producers interested in filming at the historic building. `` When they come scouting, we tell them we're interested and will take extra steps so they know we're serious about making a movie,'' she said. `` If all we could offer them was a new jail, it could not have been done.'' With `` Hard Rain,'' <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> joins a growing number of governments marketing prisons as movie sets to attract the millions of dollars local economies can generate from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> movie-makers looking beyond <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for new locations and lower production costs. `` We've got lots of competition when it comes to prisons,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> film board in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which tried unsuccessfully to attract the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by offering a vacant 19th century prison and prisoners from a neighboring jail as extras for `` Hard Rain.'' `` Now there are so many film commissions that when producers send out circulars saying they're looking for a prison, they're sorting through photos for weeks,'' <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> caught the attention of filmmakers by featuring the vacant state penitentiary in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> in a `` Prison for Rent'' advertising campaign that ran in movie catalogs and magazines. `` It described it almost like a real estate dialogue on a piece of property: ` complete with electric chair,''' said <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavallaro </PERSON>, assistant manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> stopped running the `` Prison for Rent'' advertisement a year ago, <PERSON> Cavallaro </PERSON> said, partly because the campaign's success stereotyped the state as a location for making prison movies. `` We do have a lot of prisons and we really are grateful that filmmakers think of us when they think of prison movies, but we also have to promote the rest of a very diverse state,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> state officials recently began an aggressive campaign promoting two state prisons by mailing out color fliers to 9,000 movie makers, according to <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've had a couple of feature films shot here recently and they brought in several million dollars in a short period of time. We want to open the doors up to bring in more of that money and work for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> people,'' he said. <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> wardens were enthusiastic about advertising their prisons and have agreed to let crews film in working prisons. `` They realize they're part of our economic development effort just like anyone else,'' he said. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s chief warden no longer allows movie-makers in the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, once a popular location for films, because of security and discipline concerns, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCallum </PERSON> now passes requests for the <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> prison, featured in `` Stir Crazy'' and `` Raising <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' on to states with available prisons. `` We've probably lost millions of dollars because we ca n't get the business,'' he said. In addition to money the local <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> economy can expect to make from `` Hard Rain'' when <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> hires local workers and buys supplies, the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> State Prison itself will get economic benefits from the movie, according to Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Budge </PERSON>, a prison official and consultant for the movie. `` They had to give something to the inmates, and they're donating money to the inmate welfare fund, and with that money we're purchasing recreational equipment,'' he said Budge said the prison will get to keep a truck and 350 sets of inmate denims Disney is supplying for the movie. `` They're also building a permanent guard post and adding fencing and razor wire because they want it to look more confining, and that only adds to our security,'' he said. The announcement that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> planned to make a movie at the prison also improved discipline among inmates, 300 of whom will be hired as extras, <PERSON> Budge </PERSON> said. `` Nobody wants to get locked up and miss their chance to be in the movie,'' he said.

<HEAD>New York Satire Ribs British Hits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Les Miserables'' is getting ribbed in the city that made the musical a hit, as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s gleefully poisonous `` Forbidden Broadway'' strikes sparks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Also under the satirical gun are `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' `` Cats'' and <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON>, who produced both hits. They're just some of the British targets now being lovingly lampooned on home turf The long-running spoof of the Broadway theater scene, which has been playing on and off in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since its 1981 bow at an upper Westside supper club, opened March 2 at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Fortune Theater. `` Forbidden Broadway: The West End Edition'' is the latest incarnation of a mini-musical revue that has made a cottage industry out of creator <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON>'s skills at parody. `` This show has pulled me out of poverty,'' said <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON>, 34, a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservatory </ORGANIZATION> of Music who was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> waiting tables when `` Forbidden Broadway'' clicked. In eight years, his show has ballooned from a two-person nightclub act at <LOCATION> Palssons </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to a full-fledged <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> show in a 440-seat West End theater. Last fall, a revised <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> production opened to rave reviews in larger premises _ the 130-seat Theater East. It's more than <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON> ever dreamed would happen, and requires him to maintain a sharp lookout for new trends to spoof. `` You've got to keep up, almost like a critic,'' he said. `` You listen to the theater gossip, that type of thing.'' However, he does n't want to be known just as a parodist: `` I like to think of the show operating on different levels. If audiences listen, it's informative about the theater ... and it at least works on a musical level.'' Targets under attack from his five-member <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cast range from <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> LuPone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> to <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> and <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, the Tony-winning star of `` M. Butterfly.'' A four-person <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> cast will perform about 25 percent of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> material. There's a duet spoofing musical divas <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merman </PERSON>, and a `` Les Miserables'' parody that abbreviates the 3 hour and 15 minute musical adaptation of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s epic novel into a chaotic, pell-mell 10 minutes. Other numbers come from the repertory of 150 accumulated over the years, and some were written especially for the West End. In the last category are `` The RSC Gavotte,'' referring to the government-subsidized <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, and a piece about the British theater's obsession with spies, as currently seen in <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s hit, `` Single Spies.'' There's also a song lampooning the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stage's plethora of productions of `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.'' `` Brush Up Your Richard'' is sung to the tune of `` Brush Up Your Shakespeare'' from <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Kiss Me, <PERSON> Kate </PERSON>.'' Because of the constant two-way theater traffic between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON> is confident the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> material will work here. He already looks forward to the parody potential of `` M. Butterfly,'' which opens in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> April 20. Budgeted at $ 375,000, <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON>'s show breaks even at a staggeringly low 14,000 pounds -LRB- $ 25,000 -RRB- a week, or 55 percent audience capacity. `` We could n't have done ` Forbidden Broadway' off-Broadway for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> price,'' said the show's American producer, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuiggan </PERSON>. Last season, McQuiggan produced an English play, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s `` The Common Pursuit,'' on the West End following success with the play off-Broadway Neither he nor his partner, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, is involved with `` Forbidden Broadway'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. An unrelated <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> theater spoof, `` Wicked Lips,'' proved a fast flop last year when its British creators failed to clear the necessary rights. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, composer of `` Cats'' and `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' has so far refused to approve mockeries using his melodies, so <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON>'s show parodies him with its own tunes. But `` Forbidden Broadway,'' happily, has other fans where it counts. <PERSON> Mackintosh </PERSON> has put his money where <PERSON> Alessandrini </PERSON>'s mockery is: He's invested $ 7,500 in the show.

<TEXT>
 In 1980, 50 stand-up comics tried their luck on `` Audition Night'' at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Improv. Two were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>. They quickly became friends and ended up co-writing `` Hollywood Shuffle,'' a film largely financed by <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>'s credit cards that turned into one of last season's surprise movie hits Now <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> is showcasing his own talents by writing, directing and starring in `` I'm Gon na to Git You Sucka,'' a takeoff on the `` blaxploitation'' films of the 1970s. `` A few years ago, me and some friends were sitting around and talking about the movies we used to go see,'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` The conversation went from, ` remember this movie' to ` remember this scene.' We started laughing and that was when ` Airplane' was coming out and that was kind of a blueprint for me.'' Starting with the death of <PERSON> Junebug </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON> from an overdose of gold chains -LRB- `` He was ready to die!'' the preacher boomed -RRB-, `` I'm Gon na to Git You Sucka'' takes on such movies as `` Superfly'' and `` Shaft'' and turns them upside down. <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>, who also co-wrote and co-produced the <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> concert film, `` Raw,'' plays <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Spade </PERSON>, who helps capture those responsible for his brother <PERSON> Junebug </PERSON>'s death. Assisting <PERSON> Spade </PERSON> are an aging band of tough guys played by ex-football stars <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and musician <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who wrote the theme to `` Shaft.'' `` That was the coolest thing,'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> said. `` To be able to work with those guys and then to watch them get up there and be totally uninhibited. That's because they got it. They did n't take themselves seriously. They were having a good time. In retrospect, they could see where the humor was.'' Fans of `` National Lampoon's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' will recognize <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, the dreaded <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Wermer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Faber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> is the villain again in `` I'm Going to Git You Sucka.'' He plays Mr. Big, the man behind the proliferation of gold chains. `` My first choice was <PERSON> Shelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> said. `` Initially, it was still going to be ` Mr.' Big but you would n't have ever seen her face.'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>' project took a long time to get to the screen. When the film was conceived in the early 1980s, he was a relatively unknown stand-up comic and actor. It was a time when <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studios were not interested in financing an all black film. They were, however, willing to reconsider if Wynans would agree to make a few `` minor'' changes. `` I went to <ORGANIZATION> Vestron </ORGANIZATION> and they kept coming up with the most bizarre ways to integrate the cast they could think of. ` How about if I get <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> -LRB- ` The Breakfast Club,' ` Sixteen Candles' -RRB- to be my younger brother _ a kid that was left on the doorstep of my house and act black for the entire film?' `` ` And how about if we make one of the guys like <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON>.' They wanted so desperately to integrate it they did n't care if they undermined the picture.'' But the success of `` Hollywood Shuffle'' and <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s `` She's Got ta Have It'' made the studios more receptive to <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>' project and he ended up getting <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> to distribute the film `` It was a lot easier to go in and sit down and really talk. Before we did ` Hollywood Shuffle,' if it was an all black act, no one wanted to touch it.'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> grew up in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, one of 10 children. He was trying to make people laugh as far back as he could remember and had plenty of time to display his talents at the family dinner table. `` There was always an audience and we were always competing,'' he said. `` Dinner time was sitting at a long table with my parents at each end. The objective was making the person across from you spit food.'' His early heros were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Prinze </PERSON>, who also grew up in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>. But while those comedians had traumatic and tragic lives -LRB- <PERSON> Prinze </PERSON> committed suicide just as he became a star -RRB-, <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> has no interest in being a `` tortured artist,'' `` It was n't a psychological thing where I had a horrible family life and I wanted the audience to love me,'' he said. `` There are those who just find humor in almost anything, who have warped senses of humor, which I'm a victim of. I just find everything funny and I like being funny.'' Although Mr. <PERSON> Big </PERSON> mutters ominously at the end of the movie that `` there will be no sequel,'' <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> is anxious to continue making films and also to help other blacks break into the business. `` The recognized pool of talent is so small that the opportunity is tremendous,'' said <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON>, who found roles for <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Damon </PERSON> among others. `` There's a building pool of talent right now.'' But <PERSON> Wayans </PERSON> could n't help adding, `` I used them all in the movie.''

<HEAD>Kafka Published, But Havel In Jail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> is reappearing in print in his native <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> after nearly 20 years. But <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, the Czech dramatist well-known in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, is in prison and his name is nowhere to be found on shop or library bookshelves. Like much else in a nation caught between the pressures of Soviet reform today and the Kremlin-imposed orthodoxy of the past, Czechoslovak literature and the arts present a contradictory picture. Hesitant steps toward opening up the state-controlled arts have returned a few previously unshown films _ including those by Czech-born <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> Award-winner <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> _ to the movie theaters, put a handful of more daring plays on the stage and `` legalized'' some underground rock groups. This spring, <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s novels should go back on sale in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. They had been banned under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, in the Stalinist 1950s and were out of print again after the `` Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed in 1968. Literary journals began publishing long articles on <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> and some of his notebooks last year, the first time in two decades the author saw print apart from a collection of short stories published for the 1983 centenary of his birth. But the new attitude to <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> does not extend to anything or anyone deemed a political challenge to the orthodox communists installed by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to rule after 1968. <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cernik </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Czech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, has said that emigre writers can be published. However, both he and official poet <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sys </PERSON>, editor of the relatively outspoken literary weekly <LOCATION> Kmen </LOCATION>, referred swiftly to top officials when asked in recent interviews if works by <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> or the feted emigre writer <PERSON> Milan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kundera </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' -RRB- might appear soon in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Communist party leader <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, in a December interview with the French daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION>, spelled out why. `` Kundera is not a bad writer,'' <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> said when asked whether works written since <PERSON> Kundera </PERSON> went abroad in 1977 might be published in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` But he simply takes his specific attitude to us and to socialism. ... We have many more such talents, but they ... do not speak openly against socialism.'' As an active member of the Charter 77 human rights group and a writer who refuses to leave his homeland, <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> draws far more official ire than any other cultural figure. He was arrested Jan. 16 and went on trial in February on charges of sedition and obstructing a public official that could jail him for 2 -LCB- years. The growing respect for the 52-year-old playwright among intellectuals and others outside the tiny circle of active dissidents inside <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is one explanation for the tough move. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was feted when called to the stage at a folk music festival in <LOCATION> Lipnice </LOCATION> last September, an action that later sparked official reprisals against the festival host, music critic <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rejzek </PERSON>. He was the only dissident greeted by name _ with joyful chants of `` Long Live Havel'' _ when the authorities surprisingly permitted an independent rally in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> last Dec. 10. In contrast to the public silence in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and five other activists were jailed for subversion in 1979, his January arrest prompted demonstrators in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to shout demands for his release. More than 1,000 intellectuals who had never sided with <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> in public before voiced the same demand in a letter urging the communist authorities to open up to the society they rule. Further signs of a stirring in the arts are found in the Moravian capital of <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, where theater is far more lively than in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. But political activity carries its price in <LOCATION> Brno </LOCATION>, too. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidlarova </PERSON>, an assistant director at a Brno theater, was detained in December after organizing a petition to free another jailed cultural activist, independent publisher <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Cibulka </PERSON>. Fear of such repression leaves many Czech and Slovak intellectuals wondering what to do to push for the greater freedom most seek. Like many people in the Soviet bloc, they often retreat into a private sphere of family, friends and interests. In that cozy world, characterized by a leading economist as `` somewhere between Nirvana and lethargy,'' they can pursue cultural activities for small audiences or chase material comfort. In society at large, though, they must often work at jobs that deaden initiative and cope with irritating consumer shortages _ once rare in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. As dissatisfaction mounts, official attempts at dialogue and counsels of patience ring hollow to many. `` We know how bad the situation is,'' said Sys in an interview. `` We can discuss it for hours and days. But we live here and we have to get out of it somehow.'' There are extremes on both sides in the clash between the communist authorities and independent groups, Sys said, advocating dialogue as the solution. But intellectuals who attended a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party boss and Politburo member <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON> after the petition circulated on <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said the increasingly isolated leadership still seems unwilling to open up to the society it rules.

<HEAD>Talk of Okinawa: Royal Heir's Controversial Gift to Tokyo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NAHA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The talk of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> these days is about a gift a royal heir has made to the district where he lives in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It's angry talk Okinawans are angered because they feel the heir has given away symbols of their golden age of independence long ago. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sho </PERSON>, the great-grandson of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'s last king, has chosen to give the <ORGANIZATION> Taito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> his collection of more than 1,000 family heirlooms and the ownership of a royal tomb in <LOCATION> Shuri </LOCATION>, once the seat of Okinawan royalty and now a neighborhood of <LOCATION> Naha </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> prefecture. The tomb, called the Tamaudun, is a three-room structure with limestone outer walls and sun-baked plazas of coral ground into a fine, white sand. Generations of Okinawan royalty are buried there. Local reaction to Sho's decision, disclosed in December by a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> newspaper, has often been colored by lingering friction between the majority <ORGANIZATION> Yamato </ORGANIZATION> Japanese, a broad term referring to most of the inhabitants of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main islands, and the Uchinanju, or Okinawans. `` When I heard the news, it felt like the <LOCATION> Yamato </LOCATION> people had done it to us again,'' said taxi driver <PERSON> Tamotsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yonaha </PERSON>. `` It has hurt our pride.'' `` His -LRB- Sho's -RRB- wife is Japanese, so I guess it stands to reason,'' said an old woman selling herbal tea at a market. `` But it still belongs to us.'' A special session of the prefectural assembly was convened in January, and after two days of discussion the assembly called <PERSON> Sho </PERSON>'s choice `` regrettable. Statements of protest were issued by business leaders, civic organizations and even some of Sho's relatives. Several small groups have organized grassroots opposition. However, <PERSON> Yoshin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirata </PERSON>, assistant director of the prefectural <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s culture division, said <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and the Japanese are not to blame. He credited <ORGANIZATION> Taito </ORGANIZATION> ward with trying to work out a compromise. `` They do n't want to have us glaring at them forever,'' he said. `` It seems that <PERSON> Sho </PERSON> simply wanted his estate to be kept near home, which for him is <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.'' Sho also has told the Okinawan government that he believes the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> ward will make the collection more accessible to researchers from all over the world. After being approached by Sho the <ORGANIZATION> Taito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION>, one of 23 administrative subdivisions in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, agreed to establish a $ 2.4-million foundation to care for the objects and keep the collection in one place. The ward has a population of about 177,000. `` Though disappointing, Mr. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sho </PERSON> believes that setting up the foundation with <ORGANIZATION> Taito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> is the best solution, and I would like to respect his view,'' Gov. <PERSON> Junji </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishime </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> said in a statement. The 70-year-old Sho, who was born in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, refuses to meet with reporters. Letters to the editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Okinawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which has run dozens of reports on the issue, have been strongly against the foundation, according to senior editorial writer <PERSON> Akiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Yui </PERSON>. `` He has lived in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> all his life, and I think he has little affection for <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>,'' she said, noting that <PERSON> Sho </PERSON>'s parents are buried in <LOCATION> Taito </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ward </LOCATION>. `` What the Okinawans are feeling is the irony that the descendant of their king is no longer an Okinawan.'' Sho is the great-grandson of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'s last king, <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sho </PERSON>, who died in 1901. <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> was unified into the Chuzan kingdom during the 15th century, and in its heyday traded with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In 1609, the kingdom was invaded by warriors from southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and required to pay taxes. The islands were incorporated into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1879, ending the local monarchy. Members of the <LOCATION> Okinawan </LOCATION> royal family were encouraged to move to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and marry <ORGANIZATION> Yamato </ORGANIZATION> Japanese, which most of them did. Many Okinawans believe the royals were forced to assimilate into Japanese culture. Okinawans have felt they were discriminated against over the years by the Japanese. During World War II, attempts were made to wipe out their five main dialects, which are often incomprehensible to speakers of standard Japanese. Many Okinawans blamed the government in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for the heavy fighting in 1945 on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, which was as close to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> proper as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces reached before the Japanese surrendered. More than 100,000 civilians died in the battle, which also claimed the lives of 110,000 Japanese soldiers and 12,500 Americans. Following postwar occupation by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> was turned over to Japanese administration in 1972, 20 years after the occupation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had ended. `` The Japanese -LRB- emperor -RRB- gave <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said an <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> Times editorial after Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death Jan. 7. `` The descendant of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'s -LRB- emperor -RRB- has, for free, given <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Taito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Okinawa </ORGANIZATION>'s possessions. `` We wo n't ask which crime is more serious. But to the people of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> there is just a feeling of misery.''

<TEXT>
 By condemning <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> to death for blaspheming <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has acted decisively to put the brakes on moderate trends in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A decade after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> led the Islamic revolution to power in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, many of the country's senior figures are seeking greater freedom and an end to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s political and economic isolation. Factions also are jockeying for power, trying to position themselves to take over after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> leaves the scene. But the frail, 88-year-old ayatollah seized on the unlikely issue of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, `` The Satanic Verses,'' to reassert his primacy over the secular and liberal forces gathering momentum in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. His thunderbolt shocked many in the West. The decree that an author in the late 20th century be put to death for a work of fiction reverberated from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> foreign ministries to Fifth Avenue bookstores that stocked the novel. Diplomatic envoys were recalled, and writers marched in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and signed protests in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A price of more than $ 5 million was put on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s head by two Iranian clerics. The author fled to a safe hiding place and issued an apology for sections of the book that could be considered blasphemy of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. A stern and unforgiving <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> rejected any apology and renewed his call for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s blood. He also denounced his own domestic foes. `` As long as I am alive I will not let the state fall into the hands of liberals,'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> vowed in a statement Wednesday. The ayatollah chose the issue and the timing of his assault. Controversy simmered over `` The Satanic Verses'' for months. In October, the book was banned in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the country of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s birth Demonstrations were staged against the novel in other countries. On Feb. 12, six people were killed in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> during a protest over publication of the book in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Two days later <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> issued his condemnation. On the face of it, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s statement dramatically pointed to a sharp swing back to revolutionary radicalism. Six months after an Aug. 20 cease-fire halted the war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the Iranian leadership is openly split. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> sides with hardliners who oppose demands for reforms in the country's political, social and religious life How far he will push that course is anyone's guess. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> in the past has used extremism and allegations of Western conspiracies against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and Islam to crush internal discord and rouse revolutionary zeal when he sees it flagging. The government has been paralyzed to a large degree by competing power blocs whose rivalry had been masked by the need for a united front during the traumatizing 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. So-called pragmatists led by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> have been seeking to end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s isolation and modernize its economy. Opposing them is a curious mix of revolutionary anti-Western hardliners, such as Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, and a group of conservative clerics who bitterly resist change. `` We expected the situation would improve after the cease-fire, but instead it has become worse,'' said a Western-trained Iranian doctor, echoing what appeared to be widespread sentiments. He spoke with a reporter on condition he not be identified. With the end of the fighting, some leaders have questioned what the revolution has achieved and blamed government inefficiency as much as the war for the hardships most Iranians face. The strongest criticism came from <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali-Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s designated successor. He called for a candid re-evaluation of the revolution's achievements and stressed the need `` to make up for past mistakes. `` People in the world got the idea that our business in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was murdering people,'' he added, in an apparent reference to reports that thousands of dissidents have been executed by the regime in recent months. <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> declared that `` instead of safeguarding the values of the revolution we shouted slogans. Instead of providing value to the people, we only made more and more of the intelligent and active people more and more disgruntled and isolated.'' Some Iranians had seen <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>'s criticism as a sign of imminent liberalization after 10 difficult years in which the revolution survived bloody internal strife, the war and international hostility. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s bitter denunciation of liberal trends and criticism of the leadership dashed those hopes. The powerful `` bazaaris,'' the wealthy <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> merchants who still have a strong hold on the economy, have questioning the sincerity of the liberalization process. `` They admit their mistakes, but they never do anything to correct them and the biggest mistake is the continuation of the mullahs -LRB- clerics -RRB- in office,'' one prominent merchant said. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> freed thousands of prisoners in a general amnesty earlier this month and has permitted the formation of political parties under legislation shelved during the war. How freely those parties will be able to operate is questionable. On the economic front, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> faces a massive reconstruction that officials estimate will cost at least $ 400 billion. Shortages of raw materials, because of import restrictions to save foreign currency, have left hundreds of factories operating at 30 or 40 percent of capacity. The main shopping precincts are crowded with bargain-hunters until late in the evening, even when whole city blocks are suddenly plunged into darkness by the frequent electricity cuts. The mounting problems have left <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 50 million people uncertain of their future and hungry for better days after all the hardship and heartbreak.

 <PERSON> Lesbia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocque </PERSON> and her three children hitch-hiked from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, carrying with them nothing but hunger and hope. At the end of the three-month odyssey, launched by a military summons for her 12-year-old son, the family waded across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> and asked for asylum at a rural barbed-wire-encircled government compound _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s new <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Instead, they were rejected, then arrested. After resigning his Nicaraguan government job over differences with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> tried to open a business in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, but the government shut him down. Unable to sleep, unable to feed his wife and daughter, <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> and his family headed north, only to be robbed three times in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and arrested at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border where they, too, asked for asylum as political refugees. Now the <ORGANIZATION> Aguirres </ORGANIZATION> share a pale green 12-by-12 foot room with another Nicaraguan family at a converted government agriculture warehouse, where aliens do their wash on stones and children line up for juice from <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers usually dispatched to natural disasters. `` I did n't think it was going to be like this. I ca n't go back _ they'll kill me,'' <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said through a translator. `` I do n't know what's going to happen to us.'' What is going to happen? After months of a massive influx of Central Americans and weeks of wrangling over changing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on how to handle them, that question remains unanswered, though officials see a few certainties: the human flood will continue, possibly underground, and it will strain local areas' ability to provide for the newcomers. As many as 100,000 Central Americans may enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, officials say. Most wade across the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, where clothes, letters to God and even an unused airline ticket can be found on the grassy banks, left behind in haste or happiness. They seek a new life in a new land, sometimes following a dusty road to <PERSON> Casa </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, a church-run shelter, sometimes never making it past the river's edge before arrest by the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. After a policy change last week, they most often end up living in detention, either under Army-green tents surrounded by barbed wire at a military-style base, or at the converted warehouse, where children play in the yard, fathers line up to use the single pay phone, mothers try to fight off boredom and uncertainty. Some spend the chilly nights huddled under blankets in a shabby old shed with red plastic walls on two sides. Refugees seeking political asylum _ more than half of them Nicaraguans _ were at first turned loose while their applications were processed, free to join friends and relatives in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. In December, the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> restricted the asylum-seekers to south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but that produced a squalid squatters camp. Now, aliens are given a single interview that can be as short as 10 minutes and, after being denied asylum the same day, they are arrested and held on $ 1,000 - $ 4,000 bonds pending appeal They pile up in detention centers here, the closest entry point by land to impoverished and war-scarred countries to the south. Central Americans now outnumber Mexicans trying to illegally enter the country here by as much as 9-to-1 some days, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents say. At the end of last week, more than 1,000 were being held at two <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention barracks here in the southern tip of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The turmoil created by this eight-month-old influx is widespread, even contributing to the racial tension in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that exploded in riots during Super Bowl week. Local officials here and in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> complain they ca n't provide homes, jobs and schooling for this newest migration wave. Problems with the shifting and sometimes contradictory policies, as well as feeding and clothing the people detained here, continue to mount as federal officials scramble to enforce an asylum law drafted in 1980 to accommodate 500 applications, not 100,000. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> even likened the detention to `` concentration camps,'' and immigration experts say the current plans are similar to how the thousands from the Mariel Cuban flotilla were handled. The circus-like tents used for detention, they say, could end up being permanent, and many here on all sides of the issue agree that long-term solutions have yet to be proposed. At the heart of the matter, experts say, is a continuing paradox over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration policy, which has a tradition of welcoming those less fortunate _ `` your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,'' as the <ORGANIZATION> Statue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION>'s inscription says _ and yet now turns away those in need. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has tried to deter the barrage of immigrants by loudly rejecting their political asylum applications. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials say these immigrants flee poverty, not persecution. But critics of the policy say economics and politics were in fact married by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which used economic sanctions and arms for the Contras to exert political pressure on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and devastate that nation's economy. `` When they thought about economic pressure, they never envisioned this,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON>, a political scientist and immigration expert at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Those denied asylum will be deported, even to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, after appeals have been exhausted, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said. Refugees say their countrymen will keep coming, and those who work with the refugees say these newcomers will go underground. `` Some people may simply try to go around the system. It's happened before, it will happen again,'' said Sister <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON>, co-director of <PERSON> Casa </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, an internationally known shelter for aliens `` They wo n't stop coming. This is just going to make it more difficult for them.'' The Central American stampede is not only the result of continued economic deterioration there, but also a 1987 memo from then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> directed <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials to issue work permits to Nicaraguans while their political asylum applications were pending. Word traveled back to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and last summer, numbers of immigrants began a swift rise. `` They created the boom,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Proyecto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Libertad </LOCATION> attorney working with asylum applicants. `` They've lurched from one extreme to the other.'' Said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>: `` We think that a very unfortunate sign was sent -LRB- by the Meese memo -RRB-.'' Unless an alien falls into a preference group either by family relations or special skills, there is no way to legally immigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Political asylum becomes the one legal way in. Now, attorneys complain that in its rush to slam the asylum door shut, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is prejudging all asylum claims as `` frivolous'' _ the term <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> used to describe most claims _ and rejecting endangered refugees.

 <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> spoke of a client interviewed for only 15 minutes, then rejected.

We think it's become a meaningless process,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. In the first week of speedy case resolutions, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> rejected all but two of 300 asylum applications. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials say each applicant gets a thorough and fair interview, which can range from 10 minutes to several hours. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> businessman, stood outside the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention center near here last week and decided not to take his mother-in-law from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in to seek asylum. Instead, the family will wait, live underground, and hope policies change. `` They come here to get help and they get thrown out. I do n't think it's right,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Rocque </PERSON>, the Nicaraguan who came with her three children and whose husband made it to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> a year ago while the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> memo was in force, does n't fear jail here as much as being sent home. `` Let them do whatever they want to me, but do n't send me back,'' she said. <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ygnacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> says he's continually negotiating with federal officials to protect health and public safety, and may even bill them for services and, if necessary, for running schools in the detention centers. There has been no crime wave as a result of the influx, he said. `` Our fear is we do n't want to be an open detention center,'' the mayor said. `` We have one of the higher unemployment rates in the country, but our economy is improving now. We see lots of positive movement then all of a sudden we are faced with a policy decision made by our own government that puts those things in jeopardy.'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> and others hope the situation wo n't amount to a repeat of Mariel, where nearly 125,000 Cubans came to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1980 and were placed in detention camps until they were resettled with relatives or sponsors. About 8,000, mostly mental patients and accused criminals, remain in detention camps. What does seem clear about the Central Americans, officials say, is that a permanent solution has yet to be put in place. `` The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> obviously believes it can reduce the flow of Central American immigration by sending a ` no-free-ride' signal. That may be the case,'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- we can not assume that we have taken care of the problem with this action.'' `` The reality of the immigration problem is we have not dealt with the deeper problem,'' Professor <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> said. `` The problem is as long as guerrilla wars continue, economies get worse and worse and worse. ... If we wanted to do something about Central American refugees we would create a Marshall Plan for Central America.'' <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials, while defending their policies, say they, too, believe <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must take another look at the asylum law. Only that might soothe the consciences of people here, many the descendants of immigrants _ legal and illegal _ themselves. `` There is a lot of emotion here. On one side, you just have people. On the other, it's the law,'' Mayor <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know if I'd do anything different than what these people are doing if my family was hungry and I could n't work. If the Central Americans should end up staying, those who have worked with them say they are a bright, energetic, honest and eager lot. According to immigration experts, they'll most likely succeed. `` My sense is they'll be good workers and good citizens. They've been good citizens here,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteer from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` What has happened traditionally, historically, is that people have come over and been treated shabbily, and they take it,'' said <PERSON> Hinojosa </PERSON> `` They work their butts off and they never lose sight of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. It takes two to three generations to make it, and some never make it. But many do.''

 Mid-February sales of U.S.-based companies' cars and light trucks rose 1.7 percent from year-earlier levels as the effects of sales incentives available in early 1988 began to wear off, the automakers reported. The eight automakers said Thursday that they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 36,769 during the Feb. 11-20 period this year, compared with a daily rate of 35,158 during the same time last year. The overall sales rate during the period was bolstered by a 5.4 percent increase in truck sales, which offset a 0.3 percent decline in car sales.

<HEAD>Survey Rates California Raisin Ads As Most Popular Of 1988</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Television viewers rated the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisin industry's soulful animated commercials the best TV ads of 1988 for the second consecutive year, but failed to spot any advertising breakthroughs, a survey found. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadehra </PERSON>, president of the research firm <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storyboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tests </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that the most popular ads last year also demonstrated a heavy reliance on safe standbys such as children and dogs. Video Storyboard's 11th annual list of outstanding ad campaigns put in second place the commercials for <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, including a four-part ad starring singer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and an ad with actor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> trying to avoid a watchdog blocking the way to the soda machine. Ads for <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants ranked third. McDonald's spent an estimated $ 386 million airing its commercials compared with $ 6.8 million spent by the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisin industry. <PERSON> Vadehra </PERSON> blamed the lack of advertising breakthroughs on the merger mania that has seen huge advertisers swallowed up in takeover deals and advertising agencies consolidate after a massive restructuring within that business. `` Nobody is taking any risks. Everybody is trying to play it safe,'' <PERSON> Vadehra </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Karp </PERSON>, director of creative services at <ORGANIZATION> Grey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that mergers unsettled the ad business last year, distracting some advertisers while some ad agency people `` focused less on work than on their security.'' In a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> where he is judging entries in an ad awards show, <PERSON> Karp </PERSON> said he found `` there were a lot of safe hits and not a lot of home runs last year.'' Video Storyboards compiled its ranking based on responses from 24,000 people who were asked periodically over the past year to name the most outstanding television commercial they have seen in the past four weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raisin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> aired its first commercials that use clay models of raisins, which appear to dance and sing to `` Heard It Through the Grapevine,'' in September 1986. The ads helped boost raisin sales and created a market for licensed products ranging from raisin shirts to a raisin board game. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Phinney </PERSON> of the raisin board said sales of products licensed to use the raisin characters amounted to $ 500 million last year, just short of the industry's $ 600 million in sales of the real thing. In 1988, the board aired a commercial featuring an animated <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> singing with the raisins. New spots are planned for this fall. <PERSON> Phinney </PERSON> said the raisin ads remain popular because the characters are depicted as entertainers rather than pitchmen. `` We have been very conscious of not making them salesmen,'' he said. <PERSON> Vadehra </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisin industry also got credit from some consumers for ads others did using the raisin characters. He said some consumers thought ads for Post Raisin Bran cereal and <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>'s fast-food restuarants, which each have been licensed to use the characters in their ads, were commercials for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisins. Ranked fourth behind the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> raisins, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and McDonald's campaigns were Bud Light beer ads <PERSON> Vadehra </PERSON> said consumers cited ads featuring the Bud Light spokesdog Spuds MacKenzie three times as often as the ads that show amazing things that can happen when you order a `` light'' beer. In fifth place were ads for <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> cars and light trucks featuring the fictional lying pitchman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Isuzu </PERSON>, another campaign introduced in 1986 and steadily gaining popularity. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> beer ads ranked sixth, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> soft drinks, <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s beer spots featuring <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> the dog, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>'s fast food restaurants and <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s jeans. Ads by the Partnership for a <LOCATION> Drug-Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the industry's volunteer anti-drug campaign, placed 11th The group's trademark ad is a raw egg dropped into a sizzling frying pan, meant to symbolize the effect of drugs on the brain. Falling out of the top 10 campaigns were ads for <ORGANIZATION> Bartles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jaymes </PERSON> wine coolers and <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> Stainmaster carpets.

<HEAD>Sears To Close Stores To Slash Prices As Part Of Major Restructuring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will close its 825 stores for 42 hours next week to roll back prices on more than 1.5 billion pieces of merchandise, an unusual move prompted by the huge retailer's restructuring. The stores will close from 6 p.m. Monday until noon Wednesday to cut the prices on clothes, hardware, appliances, furniture and other items to conform with <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' new `` everyday low price'' strategy. Some prices, such as those on beds, will be cut in half, while most will be reduced by lesser amounts. `` We expect it to bring more customers into <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, with more reasons to shop us than ever before,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> also announced a television, print and mail advertising blitz to sell the concept to the public. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, which reported a profit of $ 1.45 billion on sales of $ 50.25 billion last year, currently uses a strategy of frequent sales on specific items to attract customers. Its new strategy, while not new among retailers, is seen as a move to help the company modernize its image and better compete with discount stores. As part of the new pricing system, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> promises to match the price of any competitor for brand-name goods advertised in newspapers. <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> said the stategy will improve the company's efficiency and reduce the cost of inventory, distribution and promotion. He said Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> also will run several sales each year. `` We will always have to clear goods,'' he said. `` There will be the traditional efforts in July and after Christmas. -LRB- But -RRB- we will have a lot more time to look for extra special products to sell to customers.'' As part of its restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it also would offer about 1,000 name-brand items, which it will sell alongside its own <LOCATION> Kenmore </LOCATION> and Craftsman brands. Last October, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> announced the plans to introduce daily low prices at its stores. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, said the move was part of an effort to make the company more competitive. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' market share has eroded through much of the 1980s, as discount stores, such as Wal-Mart and K mart, have grown. In addition to revamping its merchandising group, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> also plans to sell the 110-story <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, its headquarters, in a bid to improve the company's earnings. The company says it will concentrate on consumer-oriented businesses: retailing, insurance, residential real estate and financial services. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' vice president of marketing, said the retailer will mount a three-week advertising campaign touting the new pricing strategy as `` the biggest change in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> history.'' `` Our goal is to reach everyone in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> several times during the launch,'' he said. One television ad shows shoppers stopping and looking around perplexed as the sound of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' employees changing prices with pricing guns fills the air. <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> estimated the new pricing strategy could save the company up to $ 200 million a year through reduced paperwork, inventory handling and other related costs. <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, however, will not become a discounter. `` Sears does n't fit into a discount box, or a specialty store or department store box,'' he said. `` Our strategy is to be a store with category dominance, supported by competitive prices, quality products and great values.''

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> promises no production layoffs and a reinvigorated company when he assumes control of textile giant <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> within the next few weeks after a bitter takeover fight. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, won the company Thursday when the <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> board of directors unanimously agreed to his $ 58-per-share tender offer. The deal, when combined with required refinancing of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> debt, totals about $ 3 billion. The buyout will be financed with $ 300 million in equity from <LOCATION> Farley </LOCATION>, $ 1.6 billion in high-yield, or `` junk,'' bonds sold by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and $ 1.2 billion in bank loans. <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is one of the nation's largest privately controled conglomerates. Its holdings include Fruit of the <ORGANIZATION> Loom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 1 underwear manufacturer; <ORGANIZATION> Acme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which sell <PERSON> Dingo </PERSON> and Acmes boots; and <ORGANIZATION> Doehler-Jarvis </ORGANIZATION>, which makes die-cast metal products for the automotive industry. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> predicted that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, with increased advertising and tighter management, could match Fruit of the Loom's 25 percent growth in the three years he has owned the company <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> went out of his way Thursday to compliment <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> employees. `` We know we can not build a first-rate company without first-rate employees, and I want to commend the men and women who work for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>,'' he said in a statement. The businessman has been the target of much criticism in the <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and east <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> communities where <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> is the principal employer. However, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> he held no bitterness toward the employees or management, including Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who led the at-times bitter fight against <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> did not want <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> to run <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> and I understand that. He's fourth generation,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said, referring to <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>'s family ties to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, Ga.-based company. But <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> apparently joined in a unanimous decision by <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s board to accept the offer. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> will leave the company once the merger is complete, in about 30 days. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> officials did not return phone calls Thursday, but issued a joint statement with <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> saying directors `` determined that the terms of the offer and the merger are fair'' to shareholders. One of management's criticisms of <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s offer was a fear he would sell parts of the company to pay down the debt. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said Thursday, `` I love all the company and I have n't made any decision on what part, if any, I would sell.'' However, he later identified Saturday's, a high-fashion line produced by <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> subsidiary Cluett-Peabody, as a likely candidate to be sold. The companies said they agreed to cancel a special shareholders meeting set for March 2. The meeting had been called at <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s request in a bid to unseat the <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> directors and replace them with a board more sympathetic to the conglomerate's bid <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said his bid beat out `` two or three'' competing offers, including one from management. He said he did not know the size of the management offer. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> fired the first shot in the battle for <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> last May, when it notified the <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> it was seeking to buy up to 25 percent of its stock. However, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> never reached that level, stopping at 9.8 percent, or 2.9 million shares, in order to prevent management from activating so-called `` poison pills'' that would make a takeover much more expensive. Those options do not become available until a bidder acquires 10 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock. Instead, on Oct. 24, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> initiated a hostile tender offer that resulted in lawsuits and countersuits, as actions by state legislators and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen, and television and newspaper advertisements highly critical of the combatants. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s initial offer, $ 48 per share, later was increased to $ 52 per share. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said Thursday he had upped the ante to $ 56 after the board put the company up for sale in an attempt to avoid a <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> takeover. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>, founded in 1886, became the nation's largest publicly traded textile company last year through its $ 1.22 billion acquisition of most of <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc.. Its latest quarterly financial statement said the company had $ 994.6 million in long-term <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has 41,000 employees and 22,000 stockholders. For the fiscal year ended Sept. 24, the company reported a profit of $ 84.4 million on revenue of $ 2.15 billion.

In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the nation's second-largest media market, publicity is proving to be as important and often more economical than normal promotions. Public relations wiz <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> finds that `` for every ad inch, an editorial inch is worth about 10 times the amount.'' `` Public relations no longer belongs to just the big people,'' said publicist <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, who promotes local community-involvement stories on behalf of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funeral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION>. `` For small businesses, public relations is so much more cost-efficient than advertising.'' The boom in smaller, regional publicity operations reflects a national trend.

<HEAD>Strong Truck Performance Push Up Vehicle Sales by 1.7 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Strong truck sales by U.S.-based automakers pushed mid-February sales of cars and light trucks up 1.7 percent over a year ago as comparisons of sales figures became less clouded by incentives. Cars and light trucks made by the eight companies sold at an average daily rate of 36,769 during the Feb. 11-20 period this year, compared with a rate of 35,158 the same time last year, the automakers reported Thursday. There were eight selling days during the period this year and nine last year. `` There's nothing alarming one way or another,'' said <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON>, an auto analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It will probably mean that when the incentives come back, they will not be drastic ones.'' Sales early last year were heavily influenced by incentives such as cash rebates and low financing deals. Incentives are in effect on some cars and trucks this year, but they are being offered on a narrower range of vehicles. The overall sales rate was bolstered by a 5.4 percent increase in truck sales, offsetting a 0.3 percent decline in car sales. Although truck sales were significantly higher this year over last year, the ratio of car-to-truck sales stayed virtually the same during both periods. Light truck sales make up slightly more than 36 percent of all vehicles sold both years. For the year, car and truck sales by domestic producers fell 3.2 percent, to a daily rate of 32,334 in 1989, compared with a 33,412 daily rate last year. There were 42 selling days between Jan. 1 and Feb. 20 this year, one fewer than during the same time last year. Cars made by domestic companies were selling at a rate 6.3 percent lower this year than last year, and truck sales have risen 1.5 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> showed a big dip in mid-February car sales, falling 18.5 percent during the period this year compared with last. The nation's No. 3 automaker said its average daily sales rate for cars fell to 2,960 during mid-February this year compared with a 3,630 rate during the same time last year. Car sales for 1989 at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> were 15.1 percent below the rate through mid-February last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales rose 7.1 percent during the period this year compared with last year, going to a daily rate of 3,105 compared with a 2,899 daily rate last year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales fell 1.2 percent during mid-February, dropping to a daily rate of 11,714 this year compared with an 11,852 rate during the period last year. For the year, the leading automaker's car sales are 11.8 percent lower this year than last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> reported a 3.3 percent gain in truck sales during the period this year over last year, rising to a daily rate of 5,169 from a rate of 5,006. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its car sales rose 1.6 percent in mid-February this year over last year, going to a daily rate of 6,833 compared with a rate of 6,727 last year. The No. 2 automaker's annual car sales are running 0.4 percent ahead of car sales to date last year, rising to a daily average of 6,441 from 6,415 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said it sold an average of 4,798 trucks during the period this year, up 4.2 percent from its daily rate of 4,604 last year.

 Here are sales results for the eight major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers for second period of February 1989.

There were eight selling days in the period this year and nine selling days last year. For the first two sales periods of the month, there were 17 selling days this year and 18 selling days last year, and for the year so far, 42 selling days this year and 43 selling days last year. Cars and trucks made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> are counted as domestic and appear in this table.

 An investment group that includes oil tycoon <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> says its $ 2.4 billion cash bid for <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is friendly and it wants to meet with management soon to discuss the proposal. But <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> officials have said little since late Thursday's surprise offer from New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Topper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors will carefully study the offer in consultation with its outside legal and financial advisers,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer `` After completing this evaluation, the board will promptly announce its conclusion and recommendation,'' he said. `` Prior to that time, we strongly urge <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> shareholders not to take any action with respect to the offer.'' <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> offered $ 35 per share in cash for all outstanding common shares of <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures a wide range of consumer and industrial products, including lawn and garden equipment, hardware and materials used to make footwear. The Topper partnership includes <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate developers <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 78, and brother <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, 77. The deadline for the tender offer is midnight March 23. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed at $ 32.75 a share, down 25 cents, on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday. <PERSON> Topper </PERSON>'s offer was disclosed after the market closed. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, though, has risen almost $ 10 a share in the past month amid takeover rumors. One industry analyst said <PERSON> Topper </PERSON>'s bid appears too good to refuse. `` The way their press release reads, they are making a tender offer and they do n't care what management thinks,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerny </PERSON>, chief investment officer at <ORGANIZATION> Kirkpatrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pettis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` But if you take into consideration that the stock one month ago was selling at about $ 23 to $ 24, this is a premium of about 50 percent,'' said <PERSON> Cerny </PERSON>, who is a shareholder. `` We could hardly imagine management feeling that this is some kind of undervalued bid. `` Our contention all along was that the company's value is in the mid-30s,'' <PERSON> Cerny </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cerny </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 1,000 employees, is made up of numerous subsidiaries that operate separately, making it ideal for a traditional buy-and-bust-up takeover strategy. Such a strategy would allow the acquirers to borrow money to complete the deal and then pay some of that money back by selling off subsidiaries. He added that he did n't know whether <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> was planning to do that. <PERSON> Topper </PERSON>, an investment vehicle created for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>, notified <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> that it would nominate a slate of directors for the annual meeting scheduled for April 27. Depending upon the board's response to the offer, it might conduct a proxy contest for control of the board. <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> said in a statement that it would like to keep the company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> and leave <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s management in place. `` We strongly desire to negotiate an amicable transaction and we would like to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> management as soon as possible to discuss our offer,'' <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> said. `` We believe our offer represents an opportunity for <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to realize exceptional value. It represents a 43 percent premium over the market price of <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> stock on Jan. 23, 1989, before the recent run-up of the company's stock,'' the partnership said. `` Our objective is to acquire, own and operate <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>, and to continue to build its manufacturing businesses over the long term,'' they said. <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> also said it has lined up financing: <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and two other banks have committed $ 1.2 billion, and an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would provide $ 1.1 billion in short-term financing. The Fishers and <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> also plan to kick in about $ 300 million of their own money. The Fisher brothers are worth at least $ 800 million, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> magazine has said. Their participation in a never-completed 1984 bid for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, led by financier <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, netted them $ 30 million. <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, 54, gained his fortune through an inheritance from his father, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, who turned his father's oil company into a worldwide oil behemoth. <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> is worth at least $ 450 million and perhaps more than $ 1 billion, according to <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>.

 The stock market headed lower today, faced with a barrage of interest-rate increases. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 8.39 to 2,281.07 in the first half hour of trading.

Open-market interest rates for securities such as bonds and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills also climbed today. While the rise in rates increased investors' worries about the business and economic outlook, analysts said, they did not come as any great surprise, given recent government reports that suggested inflation was heating up. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, up 6 -RCB- at 39 -LCB-.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, ignoring critical comments by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration concerning its inflation-fighting efforts, today boosted its key lending rate to 7 percent from 6.5 percent in a move likely to trigger increases in interest rates charged consumers. The central bank announced it was raising its discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to member banks, `` in light of inflationary pressures in the economy'' and after receiving requests from 10 of its 12 district banks. The action, taken on a 6-1 vote with <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> dissenting, came just a day after <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> issued the strongest critical comments yet by the new administration regarding the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to push interest rates higher in an effort to combat inflation. `` I do n't see as strong evidence of inflation right now as does the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Boosting the discount to the highest level in nearly three years is the most dramatic inflation-fighting move the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could have taken. Discount rate increases often signal that other short-term loans, from adjustable-rate mortgages to automobile loans, will soon become more expensive. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s comments followed several weeks of verbal jousting between the administration and the central bank. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on several occasions has said that he believed the central bank was overly concerned about inflation and should be more worried that high interest rates could impede economic growth. Another member of the administration, budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, attempted today to get his colleagues to quiet their criticisms. He said he believed it was `` extremely unhelpful just as a general matter to have an overt, visible disagreement'' between an administration and the central bank. He said such an open dispute `` tends to be unsettling to the markets'' and generally harmful to prospects for economic growth. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> commented during a budget briefing for reporters that was interupted when an aide brought him a wire service story announcing the discount rate increase. The increase came one day after two major banks _ <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> _ raised their prime lending rates to 11.5 percent from 11 percent. Several other large banks raised their prime rates as well today after the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement. Both the dollar and stock and bond markets moved lower in trading today. Banks use the prime rate as a base for setting rates on a wide variety of business and consumer loans, including car loans and adjustable-rate home mortgages. Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s action had been widely anticipated and there even was some speculation the central bank might boost the rate a full percentage point rather than a half-point. He said further tightening could be expected as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tries to control escalating prices. `` It was an appropriate action ... and does bring the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> into rough alignment with the amount of restraint needed to stay even with the new inflation threat,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We are in the process of accelerating -LRB- inflation -RRB- and it will require further <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening steps.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last raised the discount rate on Aug. 9, to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. Today's increase was the third since <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> took over chairmanship of the central bank in August 1987. The discount rate last was at 7 percent from March 7, 1986, to April 18, 1986, when it dropped to 6.5 percent. The rate bottomed at 5.5 percent in August 1986 and since then has been on the rise. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s latest action follows two particularly worrisome inflation reports for the month of January. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its Producer Price Index jumped 1.0 percent _ a 12.7 percent annual rate _ and the Consumer Price Index soared 0.6 percent, a 7.2 percent annual rate and the biggest jump in two years. By increasing interest rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> hopes to slow down economic activity and thus ease inflationary pressures in the economy. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Seger </PERSON>, the sole dissenter to today's action, has expressed concern that higher interest rates could slow economic growth too much and hurt the ailing savings and loan industry. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates adds $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion to savings institutions' operating losses. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been steadily nudging up interest rates since March 1988 in an effort to check inflation by slowing economic growth. The federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge among themselves for overnight loans and is heavily influenced by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy, has risen more than three percentage points over the last year, topping 9.5 percent Thursday. In congressional testimony Wednesday, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> called the latest increase in consumer prices `` disturbing'' and blamed it in part on recent acceleration in wage increases. He said price increases had reached unacceptable levels and could increase the chances for and severity of a recession if not brought under control. `` If inflation re-emerges, I think a recession will move up on us much more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will be a prolonged one,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. He maintained that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s credit-tightening moves would prolong the 6-year-old economic expansion and moderate the next downturn. While many analysts have been predicting that growth will slow this year, early reports indicated the economy entered 1989 with strong momentum. Fed efforts to slow the economy to a more sustainable level of growth could spell trouble for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which has pinned its deficit-reduction hopes on optimistic assumptions about the economy's performance. Today's discount rate hike was requested by the boards of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s regional banks in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Lower Opening On Slack Export Sales; Large Meal Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting slack export demand and increased precipitation in major crop growing areas. A <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report today of larger-than-expected soybean meal stocks acted as a further drag on the grain markets and the soybean complex in particular, despite a continued rise in soybean cash prices. The wheat market has resumed its downward trend after rallying briefly earlier this week on news that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said today that the return of wintry weather to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was encouraging for spring crop conditions because the snow adds moisture to soil parched by last summer's drought. In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.25 \ a bushel; corn was unchanged to -LCB- cent lower with March at $ 2.71 -LCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $ 2.06 a bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.56 -LCB- a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with April at 77.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .37 cent lower with March at 83.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .07 cent higher with April at 43.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent to .42 cent lower with March at 39.05 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled mixed on Thursday while pork futures advanced.

<HEAD>Feds and Banks Hike Key Rates, Markets Down</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The powerful <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> joined in a spree of bank interest rate hikes today, raising its key lending fee in a move that underscored a tougher anti-inflation fight and signaled higher borrowing costs for millions of Americans. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s increase in the discount rate to 7 percent from 6.5 percent was the first such rise since Aug. 9, and coincided with moves by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks to hike their prime lending rate to 11.5 percent from 11 percent. The steps jolted Wall Street today and sent stock and bond prices down sharply. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 28 points to the 2,261 level by late morning. The 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond fell nearly $ 7.50 per $ 1,000 in face amount. The discount rate is the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s loan fee to member financial institutions and historically has influenced other interest rates nationwide. The increase today put the discount rate at its highest point in three years. The prime is a benchmark for a wide range of business and consumer loan rates, including car loans and adjustable-rate home mortgages. An increase in the prime means borrowers will have to pay more to finance their debts. The half-percentage point increase in the prime was first announced late Thursday by <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> bank and quickly followed by rivals. It was the second increase in two weeks and lifted the rate to 11.5 percent, the highest level since November 1984. The prime hike reflects the higher cost of borrowing the banks face themselves, indicating the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is soaking up money in the banking system, one of its weapons in restraining inflation. The interest rate increases came against a background of signs that inflation is intensifying, a partial result of low unemployment and strong economic growth. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said consumer prices rose in January at an annual rate of 7.2 percent, the highest level in two years. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> called the inflation trend disturbing and vowed to pressure rates up until he squeezes inflation out of the economy.

 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said today that no final decision has been made on how to reduce federal spending on farm programs, but he indicated analysts are looking at many possibilities. `` We'll find a way to do so, because that's a requirement of the -LRB- budget -RRB- process,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told reporters. `` Agriculture will have to play its part in that process.'' He added: `` We'll look every where, obviously ... it'll have to be done on the basis of economic analysis. We're not going to do it in an arbitrary or capricious way, and that means analyzing all the options and combinations of options.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he is scheduled to appear before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> several times next week but would not have all the budget work done before then. Budget analysts have estimated that up to $ 2 billion may have to be whittled from <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> programs in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Those cuts were not specified in the budget proposals submitted by the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in January and were left open to be negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was asked if $ 2 billion would be enough to cut farm programs, mainly the price support operations for major commodities. He replied that in the long run he would like to see less reliance on the `` largesse and generosity'' of the federal government. `` In the long term I hope we can bring down the budget, but only if we have similar reaction from our trading partners around the world,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` We do not want to individually disarm.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> served for 3 -LCB- years as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tapped him to be secretary of agriculture. No aides to <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have yet been announced by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and key jobs are still being carried out by holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. However, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said at a news conference that he was hopeful an announcement would be made soon on the No. 2 post of deputy secretary, probably `` within the next few days.'' Reports circulated last week that <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and some presidential aides had been bickering over filling the deputy secretary job, with <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> opting in favor of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state agricultural commissioner, or <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, a cotton warehouseman from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. But there were claims that White House pressure had developed for former <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> governor <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he had been interviewed by <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> several weeks earlier. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the reports of him bickering with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were `` completely false'' and that there had been no disagreement whatsoever with the White House.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities Friday linked a Swiss-based currency trading company to a large-scale drug money laundering scandal in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> leaders closed their annual meeting today confident that organized labor can present a united front against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> if its mechanics go on strike next week. The Eastern dispute dominated the federation's Executive Council session this week, and the union leaders as their last major event went to nearby <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Thursday for a noisy rally with the Machinists outside the airline's headquarters. Federation President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said organized labor would do `` everything possible within the law'' to ground <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and their parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in the event of a strike. The meeting ended after a closing council session today devoted mostly to internal housekeeping and passage of a few final resolutions on issues of concern to labor. Among those were calls for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass provisions restricting private employers from using assets from overfunded pension plans to initiate or fight takeover attempts. The council also condemned the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for overruling a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> classification of imported multi-purpose vehicles, such as small four-wheel drive vehicles, as light trucks, which subjected them to a 25 percent tariff. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has capitulated to foreign political pressure, pointlessly increasing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and undermining the jobs of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers,'' the council said. The labor leaders also vowed to be a force in the 1991 national redistricting that will reshape congressional districts. `` It is vital that the labor movement and its allies coordinate a long-term reapportionment strategy that will assist state legislative candidates who are committed to programs that benefit working Americans,'' the resolution said. There has been rampant discussion this week about whether labor could mount a successful boycott of Eastern if there is a strike. The rally Thursday left the labor officials in an upbeat mood about those prospects. `` This kind of speaks for itself, does n't it?'' federation President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said as he marched in front of Eastern's complex at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> airport Fueling the confidence was the presence of several <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots and representatives of their union, whose support would be vital to any labor hopes of grounding Eastern during a strike. Despite the show of solidarity and militant strike talk, the labor leaders said it was still their hope President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would put off the strike deadline for 60 days by naming an emergency board to mediate the dispute. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> called on the president to intervene `` for the sake of the future of the airline, for the sake of the communities <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> serves, for the sake of the country.'' The 8,500 machinists and ground personnel, members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, are scheduled to strike at 12:01 a.m. March 4 unless a settlement is reached during mediation now under way in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, something <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> leaders consider all but impossible. Among the Eastern pilots' union officials at the rally was Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, who irritated several <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> leaders by saying Wednesday the pilots would cross Machinist picket lines if <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management `` makes it worth our while.'' `` We support the membership of the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, who apologized for any trouble his statement had caused and said it was reported out of context. The pilots, according to union policy, will not decide whether to honor Machinist picket lines until there is a strike. But one, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON>, said the `` momentum is growing very rapidly'' to side with the Machinists. Airline pilots traditionally have spoiled labor's hopes of crippling airlines during strikes by crossing picket lines. Eastern management, which has said it plans to operate in the event of a strike, made its presence felt as well. A sign hanging from a company building read: `` Welcome AFL-CIO delegates.

 Stock prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> held on to small gains Friday despite a sharp drop prompted by steep early declines on Wall Street on the back of an increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended the day 2.9 points, or 0.1 percent, higher at 2,019.5, just 0.3 point above its lowest level. The index had gained as much as 14.9 points by early afternoon. Volume came to 568 million shares compared with 551.7 million shares. Countering the negative trend, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stocks got some support from a bit of fresh buying interest at the start of a new two-week trading account in the afternoon, dealers said. `` We've ended the account on a reasonably good note considering Wall Street was down 32 points,'' when the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market closed, a dealer said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> share prices sank after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> increased the discount rate by half a percentage point to 7 percent. That rate is what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to member banks. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> divides trading into two-week and three-week periods for accounting purposes.

<TEXT>
 The dollar finished marginally higher in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Friday as the market reacted without enthusiasm to a hike in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate. Gold prices fell. Foreign exchange dealers said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s move to raise the discount rate to 7 percent from 6.5 percent initially caused the dollar to steam to a session high of 1.8330 West German marks Although dealers had been complaining about the lack of strong action from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> for months, some thought the rate hike was not strong enough. `` It would have been a full point, many people thought, and the dollar then went down,'' said a trader at a large <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bank. Others said the move came too late and had only a symbolic effect that wore off. The dollar then traded in quiet ranges. Selected late dollar rates, compared with late Thursday: 1.8270 West German marks, up from 1.8215; 1.5602 Swiss francs, up from 1.5535; 6.2265 French francs, up from 6.2125; 2.0630 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0590; 1,350.00 Italian lire, up from 1,344.50; 1.1990 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1958. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar strengthened against the British pound. One pound was trading at $ 1.7520, cheaper for buyers than $ 1.7595 late Thursday. The dollar was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 126.53 Japanese yen, up from 126.29 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at Thursday's close. Gold traded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 390.20 a troy ounce, down from $ 391.50 bid late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the late bid price was $ 389.00 dollars, down from $ 391.75 bid late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.18 to close at a bid $ 390.68. Silver bullion was unchanged in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.04 dollars a troy ounce, the same bid as late Thursday.

<HEAD>Racketeering Claim In Continental Airlines Suit to Go to Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The courts will review a $ 1 billion racketeering fraud claim lodged by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, accusing rival carriers of overcharging travel agents who used the companies' computers to make reservations, a judge ruled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> on Feb. 17 refused to dismiss the civil claim brought by Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> against rivals <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Nearly a dozen other airlines also were involved in the action. <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> also denied motions for summary judgment filed by American and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. The Continental lawsuit charges the two airlines with violating the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act. At issue is the price the two airlines charged travel agents for use of the companies' computer reservation systems. The plaintiffs are seeking $ 1 billion in reimbursement of such fees paid from 1981 to 1987. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edd </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said the racketeering allegations stem from the fact that rates appeared higher if travel agents called up flights on the airlines' computers. `` Since everybody knew it was that way, and the airlines knew, to us it seems incongruous to suggest that what existed was fraudulent or misleading to anybody,'' <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said. `` We do n't believe there is a shred of evidence.'' That system, which was phased out in 1984, had been investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which took no action, <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> said.

 The mayor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, sent a letter Friday congratulating <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> on his takeover of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, but many local residents are n't quite as enthusiastic about the textile giant's new owner. `` A year from now, I want to hear how these people like working for a damn <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>,'' one angry caller to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> radio phone-in program said Thursday, after <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> agreed to the buyout. `` I was born into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- a predecessor of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> -RRB-, and I sure wanted to die a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>.'' But many residents of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> for years has been the main employer, appeared ready to work for <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> even though <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> bitterly had opposed his hostile buyout offers for months before capitulating. Buttons and bumper stickers proclaiming `` Stop Farley'' were on view Friday, one day after the takeover was announced, with an altered, handwritten message: `` We Love <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, general manager of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> radio station WCJM-AM. `` We have no choice,'' <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON> said. `` He's the man in power now.'' <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> employs about 8,000 people in the area of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> state line. Many were concerned about their future upon hearing that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, chairman of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had succeeded in his four-month hostile takeover fight. The <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> board of directors on Thursday approved <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s $ 58-per-share buyout offer, which will total about $ 3 billion when combined with refinancing of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> debt <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has promised no production layoffs and praised the <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> employees for working hard during the recent months of uncertainty. But he also has indicated some portions of the company may be sold. `` I just hope they do n't shut the mills down,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a 20-year <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> employee from <LOCATION> LaGrange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> of nearby <LOCATION> Lanett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` That's the way these people are living.'' West Point Mayor H.E. <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday that he believes fears of mass layoffs are unfounded. `` I never felt it was inevitable that <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> would have mass layoffs,'' the mayor said. `` He was n't buying <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> to go out of business.'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> also said he welcomed <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s presence in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. `` I feel it is the end of a tradition but the beginning of a new era,'' he said. `` I sent a letter of congratulations this morning on behalf of the city and myself personally.'' Other holdings of <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, one of the nation's largest privately-held conglomerates, include Fruit of the <ORGANIZATION> Loom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 1 underwear manufacturer; <ORGANIZATION> Acme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which sell <PERSON> Dingo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Acme </ORGANIZATION> boots; and <ORGANIZATION> Doehler-Jarvis </ORGANIZATION>, which makes die-cast metal products for the automotive industry. <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON>, who spent Friday morning talking to people around town, said many in the area are n't buying <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s promises just yet. `` I have a lot of apprehension,'' <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I wonder if Mr. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> is sincere when he says he wo n't sell off His immediate plan was to, and now he's twice as much in debt.'' But <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON> said most local residents are `` willing to go the second mile to help him -LRB- <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> -RRB- make it a success.'' <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON> said several local residents were disappointed that <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> failed to stop <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> and that he did not offer more of an explanation once the decision was made to accept <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s bid. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, whose family was associated with the company for four generations, and President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> will leave <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> once the merger is complete. `` <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> is the lifeblood of this community,'' <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON> said. `` Over 8,000 people here work for them. They've been a steady oak for 103 years. `` We've leaned on them _ too much,'' he said. `` And now we've come to the crossroads.

 Wheat futures prices closed substantially higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in response to bullish chart signals and rumors of impending export sales. Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed in light trading.

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> will temporarily freeze oil exports to cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s and independent producers' efforts to stabilize world oil prices, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON> said Friday. `` Our decision is rather symbolic since we are not in a position to increase significantly our export levels which, in turn, represent only an insignificant portion of the world market,'' he told reporters. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is the second non-OPEC country to announce a change in exports since Tuesday's meeting of independent producers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> said earlier it would reduce exports by up to 5 percent. In a statement released after the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting, the group said several nations had agreed either to cut or to freeze exports in the second quarter to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' efforts to reduce output and increase world oil prices. The group also said details of the agreement would be released later. Analysts speculated the cuts would total about 200,000 barrels a day. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> established a new six-month quota that took effect Jan. 1 under which it was to cut production to 18.5 million barrels, about 4 million barrels less than it was producing at the end of 1988. Although the cartel is said to be producing more than 19 million barrels, prices have risen about $ 5 a barrel since the quota was announced last November. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, whose oil industry has experienced problems including guerrilla attacks on its pipelines, has made it clear that it was not in the position to reduce exports. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> exports 180,000 barrels out of a total 435,000 barrels produced daily. The South American country said it is working to expand domestic oil pipelines and increase its production capacity to 600,000 barrels per day next year. Among those represented at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting in addition to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> were: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fed's Tighter Credit Means Higher Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers and businesses will pay more for a wide range of borrowing, from car loans to mortgages, because of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s intensified war on inflation, economists said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is ratcheting up rates because its slow-but-steady steps to tighten credit so far have failed to prevent inflation from taking hold, experts say. The central bank's interest-rate steering wheel has gotten looser in recent years. So, like someone at the wheel of a carnival arcade driving game, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may now have to oversteer to get the results it wants _ and hope it does n't cause a crash. Indeed, rooting out inflation now that it has become established will take measures so tough that there is a chance they unintentionally could produce a recession, economists say. `` In the entire last year the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> acted with so much discretion that it was almost painful to see. Now people know that they mean business,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schott </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schott </PERSON> said there was about a 50-50 chance of a Fed-instigated recession, although most other economists have said a downturn this year is unlikely. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> signaled its long-term commitment to a stepped-up inflation fight by raising its discount rate on loans to member banks by half a percentage point to 7 percent, its highest level since April 1986. Major banks, which have been squeezed by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> pressure on other short-term interest rates, already had begun raising their prime lending rate half a percentage point to 11.5 percent. The hike in the bank rate _ which now is at its highest since November 1984 _ will boost costs of some adjustable-rate mortgages, home-equity loans, auto dealer inventory loans and other forms of borrowing tied to the prime. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s squeeze on credit will drive up lending rates across the board. Auto loans already have gotten more expensive _ they range from 11 percent to 13.5 percent nationally, excluding special incentive rates from automakers _ because of the rising cost of funds for loan issuers. Any further <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening could push auto loans still higher, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Fixed-rate mortgages probably are least affected by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening, but they too have risen about 1 percentage point over the past year. The national average on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans is likely to rise another three-quarters of a percentage point in coming months, to the 11.25 percent to 11.75 percent range, before trending downward as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> gets a grip on inflation, predicted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. Unfortunately for borrowers, painfully high interest rates are the only tool the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has to control inflation. If the increases are n't painful, economists say, people and businesses will continue to borrow freely, the economy will grow too quickly and shortages of labor and materials will drive prices higher. In January, strong economic growth produced annual consumer price inflation of 7.2 percent, the highest in two years, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s influence on interest rates is less effective in controlling the economy than it used to be partly because it has less impact on the housing market. Dampening the housing market tends to ripple through the rest of the economy, from lumber suppliers to appliance makers. Former federal limits on interest rates made it uneconomical for banks and savings institutions to make mortgage loans when their cost of funds got too high. With those caps now gone, mortgage funds are always available and customers are willing to pay higher rates. ``'87 and'88 were terrific for home sales'' in spite of gradually rising rates, said the Realtors' Tuccillo. Oddly, in the past year, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s very success in establishing its credibility as an inflation fighter undermined its ability to fight inflation. Investors were so confident of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to whip inflation that they aggressively bought long-term government and corporate bonds, which are sensitive to inflation. That strong demand held down long-term interest rates and helped fuel economic growth _ not what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wanted. Now long-term rates are beginning to rise, which should cool off the economy. One reason is that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> finally has raised short-term rates so high that investors are switching to short-term investments from long-term bonds, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosworth </PERSON>, a Brookings Institution economist. Investors also are backing away from long-term bonds due to the loss of some confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to quickly curb inflation. Yields on the bonds are consequently rising, raising long-term borrowing costs, and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s objectives are being accomplished through the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s failure. `` This is the kind of Machiavellian thinking one has to go through,'' <PERSON> Schott </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has increased a breach of contract fine against <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest retailer, to more than $ 78 million. Attorneys for the Troy, Mich.-based retailer asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagueux </PERSON> to reduce a $ 73.3 million award granted last month when a jury found K mart in breach of contract with a now-defunct <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION> clothing buyer. Instead, <PERSON> Lagueux </PERSON> denied the motion Thursday and ruled that 12 percent interest on the basic damages of $ 59.3 million could be calculated over 19 more months than originally included, increasing the award by about $ 5 million. He also upheld a magistrate's order that K mart must pay $ 80,870 for refusing to supply some pretrial information to the plantiff, <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Fashion House charged that K mart ignored an 1983 agreement requiring the retailer to purchase 85 percent of its name brand and designer clothes from the wholesaler. K mart maintained <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was not supplying the styles, sizes and colors it ordered. After a 56-day trial, <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> won a $ 73.3 million verdict, including interest. The jury found K mart, a $ 28-billion-a-year retailer, had terminated the contract in 1986 without just cause.

 <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to settle a securities-fraud lawsuit. The suit against the company and top executives was brought more than a year ago by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that helped pay for completion of the idle <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant. <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chief counsel for <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said less than $ 1 million in cash would be paid to two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities firms that filed the suit. He said the company's liability insurance and executive indemnification rights would cover the payments The case was set for trial next month in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> before the settlement was announced Thursday. The settlement must be approved by the federal judge handling the case in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy judge overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization. `` The company and the officers and directors have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing, but they have entered into the settlement to avoid further inconvenience, disruption, delay, expense and the uncertainty of further litigation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed by Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Elliott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION> about a month before <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sought bankruptcy protection in January 1988. It centered on the utility's June 1986 suspension of warrants for purchasing <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> common stock. The warrants were due to expire in October 1991. The firms charged that <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> tried to mislead investors and stall attempts to seek relief by failing to give adequate notice it had suspended the warrants. In a statement Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the settlement would include a new bond-for-stock exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> suspended the warrants as its finances worsened because of licensing delays for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>, utility spokesman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> owns 36 percent of the project, which was completed in July 1986 but remains unlicensed because of emergency-planning and financial problems. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued more than 18 million of the warrants along with $ 425 million in 17 -LCB- percent debentures in December 1984. The financing, a utility industry record, let <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> pull back from the brink of bankruptcy and finish <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>. Warrant holders were able to exchange each one for a share of common stock by paying $ 5 cash or turning in debentures with a $ 5 face value. The warrants are traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the debentures and common stock on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firms said they were unaware the warrants had been suspended when they bought the warrants and debentures in 1987. The firms alleged <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> failed to disclose the suspension in 1987 filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. If the settlement wins approval, warrant holders could exchange lots of 200 warrants and $ 1,000 worth of debentures for lots of 200 shares of common stock, the utility said.

<HEAD>Du Pont's Fibers Employees Get Bonus Payout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Employees in <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s fibers department will receive bonuses equal to 3 percent of their 1988 salaries next week in the first fruit of an experimental pay plan, an executive said Friday. When the plan takes full effect next year, a portion of employees' pay raises will be tied to the department's profitability The <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del.-based chemical giant has touted the plan as a way to increase profitability by giving employees a stake in the business. The 20,000-employee fibers department makes products such as nylon, Dacron, Lycra, Orlon, Kevlar and <PERSON> Antron </PERSON>. Next week's bonuses are considered an incentive because the program is not fully in operation and no portion of employees' salaries was actually at risk Next year if the department performs poorly they could lose the entire amount they put at risk. `` We announced to employees in early February that our performance in 1988 was such that we would have a 3 percent payout. Checks will be distributed Monday and Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON>, who led the team that developed the plan. If the department meets 80 percent of its 1989 earnings goal, employees will receive half of their pay that was at risk. If the goal is met, employees will receive all of the `` at risk'' money. Employees could receive three times the amount at risk if earnings goals are exceeded by 50 percent. For 1988, the department overshot its goal for after-tax operating income of $ 626 million by about 12.5 percent, resulting in the 3 percent payout, according to <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON>. The bonuses are `` an incentive for the people participating in the program. It's a way of saying thanks for the job that we did together as a team in 1988 and so it's a bonus as we move toward variable pay for 1989,'' <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> said. It is expected to take three to five years to fully phase in the plan until the employee has a maximum amount of money at risk equal to 6 percent of what their pay would have been if they had received all scheduled raises. Employees who do not receive a raise this year will not have pay at risk and thus will not be eligible for bonuses. During the phase-in period, each employee will always receive at least 1 percent of any raise, regardless of the fibers business performance. <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> noted, however, that late last year about 10,000 employees voluntarily put 2 percent of salary `` at risk'' for this year. The plan was mandatory for all department employees except unionized workers. About 2,000 production workers at the <LOCATION> Spruance </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, voted against the plan, <PERSON> McNutt </PERSON> said, while the others voted to be in. The department has about 6,000 to 7,000 union workers at plants in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> said if the plan works, it could become a model for the whole company.

 Oil futures prices rose in moderate trading Friday, led by a rally in the gasoline pits. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, unleaded gasoline for March delivery rose 0.37 cent to close the day at 50.11 cents a gallon after trading 79 points higher during the session. Crude oil for April ended the day up 24 cents at $ 18.07 a barrel, breaking through what analysts said was an important resistant point at $ 18. March heating oil advanced 1.14 cents to settle at 51.73 cents a gallon. Analysts said crude prices got a boost from a short-covering rally in the oil-products pits, mainly gasoline, with brokers buying before the March contracts expire on Tuesday. Dealers also continued to scramble to lock in fixed-volume deals before summer, said <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, commodity oil broker and analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` People are worried about gasoline supplies and about -LRB- higher octane -RRB- regulations even though they do n't take effect until May,'' she said. Several Northeastern states, pending approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, will impose the new rules requiring refiners to make the higher octane gasoline. Once the speculations take effect, lower octane gasoline might be in short supply for states outside of the region, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock soared Friday following an unsolicited $ 2.4 billion takeover offer from an investment group that includes oil heir <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of a wide range of consumer and industrial products, said it would study the offer, which came about a year after the company's own unsuccessful hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Stanadyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> advised stockholders not to take any immediate action on the $ 35-per-share offer announced by <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>'s group, <ORGANIZATION> Topper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, after the close of stock trading Investors reacted enthusiastically to the offer Friday, but apparently expected <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> to bid higher. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 7.12 -LCB- to $ 39.87 -LCB- a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> stock rose almost $ 10 in the past month amid takeover rumors. <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> told <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> in a letter it would nominate a slate of directors for the <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting scheduled for April 27. Depending upon the board's response to its offer, the group said it might conduct a proxy contest for control of the board. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Paper </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kirkpatrick </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pettis </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> would likely increase its bid. `` They have the resources to go higher,'' Paper said. Paper said <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> has been undervalued for several months, but has caught investors' eyes with series of well-planned acquisitions over the past four years. `` They have transformed this company from a machinery company to a very good multi-industry company,'' he said. Among the businesses <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> acquired recently were <ORGANIZATION> GardenAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of garden watering systems, and <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pfister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of faucets and plumbing supplies. A year ago, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> outbid <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> with an $ 820 million offer for Stanadyne, a maker of plumbing fixtures, automotive and metal products. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> had begun a hostile $ 596 million tender offer for Stanadyne after being rebuffed in a friendly buyout attempt. Another <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettis </PERSON> analyst, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerny </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s diverse subsidiaries made it ideal for a traditional buy-and-bust-up takeover strategy Topper, which also includes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate developers <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> it planned to sell Price <PERSON> Pfister </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>'s Information and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> division. But the group said its objective was to `` acquire, own and operate <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>, and to continue to build its manufacturing businesses over the long term.'' <PERSON> Topper </PERSON> said it had lined up financing for its offer. The group said <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and two other banks have committed $ 1.2 billion and an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would provide $ 1.1 billion in short-term financing. <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, 54, gained his fortune through an inheritance from his father, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>, who turned <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> into a worldwide oil giant. The <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> brothers participated in a 1984 bid for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> led by financier <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The bid ended with the Steinberg-led group selling their shares back to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> at a premium. <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 126 million during 1988 on sales of $ 2.76 billion, up from earnings of $ 106 million and sales of $ 2.45 billion in 1987.

<TEXT>
 Stock and bond markets were battered Friday after major commercial banks and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted key lending rates as the central bank toughened its fight against inflation. In the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average skidded 43.92 points to close at 2,245.54, its biggest daily drop in three months. The decline came only two days after the market's best-known indicator lost 42.50 points amid signs that inflation at the consumer level was accelerating. In Friday's broader market, seven stocks fell for every two that rose among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Bond prices fell as much as $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value, sending interest rates higher with yields on 30-year bonds climbing to 9.19 percent from 9.14 percent late Thursday. Short-term interest rates finished even higher: one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were yielding 9.50 percent late Friday, offering investors a powerful incentive to dump stocks. The dollar finished mixed in foreign exchange trading. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON>, senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said he expects interest rates will move even higher before the economy slows enough to relieve inflationary pressures, as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> desires. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will will have to continue to tighten a bit more aggressively. A modest interest rate increase on the order of one percentage point should be enough to cool the economy off sufficiently,'' he said. Such a move would increase chances that the economy could fall into a recession, another worry for stock investors trying to divine the outlook for corporate profits. But, <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON> said, he believes `` the economy has enough inherent strength'' that there is a better than even chance a recession will avoided. Before the stock market opened Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> boosted its discount rate, its charge on loans to member banks, by a half percentage point to a three-year high of 7 percent. Boosting the discount rate is the central bank's most dramatic signal that it intends to tighten credit and slow economic growth, thus reducing borrowing, wage and price demands. Some analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s move was overdue, especially in light of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s statements that he found recent inflation `` disturbing'' and that the bank would continue erring on the side of retraint in fighting it. Fears about accelerating inflation have heightened in recent weeks with news that wholesale prices shot up 1 percent in January and that consumer prices were up 0.6 percent last month, their biggest jump in two years. Until Friday, the central bank's moves had largely been conducted behind the scenes, such as the draining of reserves from the banking system, a maneuver that forces some banks to borrow to meet capital requirements. The discount rate hike followed <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement after the stock market closed on Thursday that it was boosting its prime lending rate, a benchmark lending charge that affects rates paid on commercial, home and other consumer loans, to 11 -LCB- percent from 11 percent Other major banks matched <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s increase on Friday. It was the second half percentage point rise in the prime rate in the last two weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last raised the discount rate in August, to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. The discount rate last was at 7 percent from March 7, 1986, to April 18, 1986, when it dropped to 6.5 percent.

<HEAD>Leaders of Flight Attendants Vote to Support Strike Against Eastern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the union representing flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Friday to ask members to honor a strike by Machinists against the company that could begin March 4. Officials with the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 553 </ORGANIZATION> said they're confident their 7,000 members will not cross Machinist picket lines In a statement, union president <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of Miami-based Eastern. `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has the gall to ask flight attendants to cross a picket line when he is cannibalizing our great airline,'' she said. `` He wo n't promise to stop dismantling Eastern by selling gates, aircraft and upstreaming money to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Airlines -RRB-. Yet, he wants our members to come to work and help him destroy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the economies of Eastern cities like <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is the other major subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. The flight attendants union received formal requests to support a strike from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' international president, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> at Eastern. `` We had no hesitation in supporting our colleagues and fellow unionists of <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` We realize if <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> destroys the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> workers' livelihood, we are his next target.'' An official of the Eastern pilots union said Wednesday the pilots would cross Machinist picket lines in the event of a strike, provided <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> guarantees job security for the pilots and meets their other demands. The pilots union official later apologized to <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> for any trouble his statement had caused. The Machinists represent about 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground personnel at Eastern. The union has threatened to strike over contract concessions demanded by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> to save money at the airline, which has lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the last several years.

<HEAD>Lumber Futures Tumble As Loan Rates Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Lumber futures fell sharply Friday as traders anticipated higher mortgage rates and a slowdown in home construction after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> increased its main interest rate. On other markets, frozen pork-belly futures plunged the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound; livestock futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed; energy futures rose; and precious metals retreated. Lumber settled $ 3.40 to $ 4 lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in March at $ 182.80 per 1,000 board-feet. The decline followed increases in both the prime lending rate, which is the benchmark on which banks base their loan rates, and the discount rate, the interest rate that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to its member banks. Most major banks raised their prime rates 0.5 percentage point to 11.5 percent while the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> upped its discount rate to 7 percent from 6.5 percent. The increases were seen as efforts to fight inflation by slowing down the economy. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, a lumber market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Eugene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said the higher interest rates could lead to a substantial weakening of the lumber market, which has been in a two-year upswing. `` I tend to believe we're going to be under pressure at least until the early part of spring,'' <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said. Futures prices for frozen pork bellies fell steeply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly cold storage report, which was expected to show record-high supplies of the unsliced bacon meat in the nation's commercial meat lockers. The report, which was released after the close, confirmed those expectations. It showed 113.4 million pounds of bellies in cold storage as of Feb. 1, far surpassing both the year-ago figure of 63 million pounds and the previous Feb. 1 record of 90.2 million pounds set in 1981. The report also showed record-high total pork supplies and suggested that both turkey and ham would be in abundant supply for Easter. Analysts said the massive pork-belly supply could become a major depressant on the futures market this summer unless retailers stimulate the movement of bellies out of storage by cutting bacon prices, which now average about $ 1.49 a pound. `` We need to knock 50 cents off the retail bacon price in a hury or this market's goose is cooked,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s chief livestock market analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .23 cent higher with April at 78.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .30 cent lower with March at 83.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .23 cent lower to .20 cent higher with April at 43.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.32 cents to 2 cents lower with March at 37.42 cents a pound. Wheat futures moved substantially higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid bullish chart signals and rumors of impending export sales. Other grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed in light trading. Wheat settled 5 cents to 7 cents higher with March at $ 4.34 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $ 2.71 -LCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.06 \ a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents lower to 4 \ cents higher with March at $ 7.61 Crude oil spurted above $ 18 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on news that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> planned to freeze its oil exports to help boost prices, a move seen as strengthening <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s hand. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 24 cents higher with April at $ 18.07 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent to 1.14 cents higher with March at 51.73 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .30 cent to .50 cent higher with March at 50.11 cents a gallon. Most precious metals futures prices slipped lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar strengthened Gold settled $ 2 lower to 10 cents higher with April at $ 392.60 a troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 1 cent lower with March at $ 5.925 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Coastal Extends Offer For Texas Eastern Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, stalling for time to consider what to do next in its quest to buy <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday it had extended its $ 2.6 billion offer for the natural gas company. Coastal spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> extended its $ 42-a-share offer, which had expired at midnight Thursday, until March 10. `` What this extension does is preserve our options. It gives us time to review the courses of action that are available to us, which include raising the offer,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which has rejected <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile takeover offer, on Monday accepted a $ 3.2 billion, $ 53-a-share, offer to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. All three natural gas companies are based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Since Coastal launched its tender offer on Jan. 17, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> stock has soared, closing at $ 52.25 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, unchanged from Thursday's close. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> began a cash tender offer Tuesday for up to 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 60.8 million outstanding shares at $ 53 a share. Those shares not purchased under the cash offer will be exchanged for <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock at the same $ 53 a share. Panhandle's offer expires March 20. If the merger is completed, the combination of <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would create a 27,000-mile pipeline system and produce the nation's second-largest pipeline company in total miles, <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials have said.

<HEAD>Pathe Entertainment to Acquire New World in $263 Million Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Struggling film and television producer <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Pathe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a deal worth $ 138 million. New World sold Marvel Comics earlier this year and its most recent film releases have been box-office duds, including `` Hellbound: Hellraiser II,'' `` Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'' and `` Telephone.'' The deal with <ORGANIZATION> Pathe </ORGANIZATION>, payable in $ 57.2 million in cash and $ 80.8 million in non-interest bearing notes, is subject to approval by the New World board before Tuesday. Each New World shareholder is expected to receive about $ 8.20 per share, $ 3.40 in cash and $ 4.80 in a note. <ORGANIZATION> Pathe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman is <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the former president of 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. The company also holds interests in banking, insurance, real estate and tourism. <ORGANIZATION> Pathe </ORGANIZATION> is owned by Italian businessmen <PERSON> Giancarlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Parretti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorini </PERSON>, who also hold a controlling interest in the <ORGANIZATION> Cannon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a film production and distribution company. New World stock rose 75 cents to $ 5.75 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Friday. The discount below the $ 8.20-per-share acquisition price reflected investors' doubts about the value of the notes. New World, which lost $ 18.5 million in 1987 on revenues of $ 384.3 million, sold its <ORGANIZATION> Marvel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comics </ORGANIZATION> unit for $ 82.5 million. The production company posted operating losses of $ 79.1 million on revenues of $ 220.8 million in the first nine months of 1988, and carries $ 125 million in debt. New World announced in late January it was exploring strategic and financial alternatives. New World's latest theatrical releases have been greeted by sluggish box-office revenues. The company stopped reporting grosses for `` Hellbound: Hellraiser II'' after the film collected just $ 11.9 million in 45 days of distribution. Upcoming New World titles include `` Heathers,'' `` Warlock,'' `` The Punisher'' with <PERSON> Dolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundgren </PERSON> and `` <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'' with <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>. The company's television division produces the current series `` Tour of Duty,'' `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law,'' `` The Wonder Years'' and `` A Fine Romance,'' and the soap opera `` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The former owner of a defunct computer training school admitted bilking the government out of $ 25 million in federal aid for ineligible students through bogus high school diplomas. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON>, the former vice president part owner of <ORGANIZATION> Hausman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to one count each of conspiracy and fraud. <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Plainview </LOCATION>, admitted to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leval </PERSON> that he and others conspired to obtain federal loans and grants for students in his school through fake high school diplomas. He also admitted fraudulently obtaining the $ 25 million through two Department of Education programs between 1983 and 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Hausman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a post secondary training school with about 800 students, closed in 1987 after losing is accreditation. According to Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Deirdre </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, many of the students were not high school graduates and thus were not eligible for federal aid. Under its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state operating license, the school could only enroll high school graduates. <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnesi </PERSON>, claimed a number of students, who otherwise would have been ineligible, graduated from the school and are now gainfully employed. <PERSON> Carnesi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON> would pay back the $ 1.4 million in salary he received from the school over the five-year period. <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON> admitted in his guilty plea that school employees created bogus high school diplomas for students enrolled at the computer school in order to obtain federal aid. He is the second employee of the school to plead guilty to criminal charges. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Faughaner </PERSON>, 49, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a former recruitment director at the school, pleaded guilty last December to conspiracy and making false claims.

Ms. <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said there were no plans `` at this stage'' to prosecute any of the students who obtained loan and grant money illegally because `` It's not clear that the students would have known that there was a violation of the law.''

As part of the agreement, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former president, has resigned from the board of directors. Also, the company has fired certain corporate officers and supervisors identified by the government in a sealed document, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney. The plea agreement will be presented to a federal judge for formal acceptance. No date for the presentation has been set. Prosecutors alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION> submitted false certificates to the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> from 1980 through October 1987. The certifications pertained to whether the parts met contract specifications, the government said. According to prosecutors' allegations: _ <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION> substituted `` scrap'' or re-used alloy in the production of turbine engine parts in place of the newly-refined, or virgin, alloy required under the contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>; _ <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION> certified that the parts provided to those agencies met certain requirements demonstrated by tests performed on virgin alloy while the parts were made of a mix of scrap and <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $ 25,000 to the Office of the Inspector General of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and $ 25,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as reimbursement for investigative costs, <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Aerodyne </ORGANIZATION>, which employs about 175 people, has been a defense contractor for the past decade. By agreeing to terms of the plea agreement the company has taken a step toward rehabilitating itself as a corporate entity, <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON> said in an announcement.

 The dollar sagged against the West German mark and had a mixed showing against other currencies Friday despite boosts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. Gold prices paused their recent advance. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 389 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EST, down from Thursday's late bid of $ 390.70. In early <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading, the dollar rose during a temporary flurry of dollar-buying after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> announced it was raising its discount rate by a half-point to 7 percent. The buying subsided after currency dealers decided the rate hike would have little impact. An increase in the key rate, which is the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to private banking institutions, was widely anticipated in light of the decision by the nation's private banks to raise their prime lending rates. On Thursday and Friday, a series of major banks drove up the rates used as benchmarks for variable loan interest charges to 11.5 percent from 11 percent. Also, the dollar was sold due to persistent worries that failure to solve the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and budget deficit problems will cause lasting economic damage. Many dealers decided to buy West German marks on the grounds that interest rates in that country will probably rise soon because inflationary pressures have been building up due to robust economic activity. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar finished at 1.81875 marks, down from 1.82175 Thursday. `` We are expecting some interest rate increases in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as the government acts to get control of inflation,'' said <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, chief currency dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, the dollar strengthened against the British pound. One pound was trading late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s day at $ 1.7520, cheaper for buyers than $ 1.7595 on Thursday. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a pound cost $ 1.7530 compared to $ 1.7605 Thursday. The dollar was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at 126.53 Japanese yen, up from 126.29 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at Thursday's close. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 126.125 yen, down from 126.175 Thursday. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange markets were closed Friday for a national holiday, because of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's levels, included: 1.55245 Swiss francs, up from 1.5505; 6.194 French francs, down from 6.2160; 1,342.50 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.19825 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19485. Selected late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday: 1.8270 West German marks, up from 1.8215; 1.5602 Swiss francs, up from 1.5535; 6.2265 French francs, up from 6.2125; 2.0630 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0590; 1,350.00 Italian lire, up from 1,344.50; 1.1990 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1958. Gold bullion prices were mostly lower after rising recently amid evidence that inflation has accelerated. Investors frequently turn to precious metals when inflation erodes the value of other assets. Gold traded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 390.20 a troy ounce, down from $ 391.50 bid late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the late bid price was $ 389.00 dollars, down from $ 391.75 bid late Thursday. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery closed at $ 391.10 a troy ounce, 10 cents higher than Thursday's settlement price In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.18 to close at a bid $ 390.68. Silver bullion prices were little changed. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver for current delivery declined to $ 5.923 a troy ounce from $ 5.931 Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, silver was unchanged at a bid of $ 6.04 dollars an ounce.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the first of two special dividends to be paid in late June will be made in cash rather than notes, as previously announced. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said the decision to issue the dividend in cash `` resulted from the expeditious closing of the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> deal along with the rising trend in short-term interest rates.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> completed the sale of its 78 percent share of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.24 billion on Thursday, <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> announced on Jan. 29 after completing the sale of more than $ 7 billion in assets as part of a major restructuring, that it would pay two special dividends, one of $ 4 a share in notes and a second of $ 3 a share in cash and $ 1 a share in preferred stock, for a total of $ 8 per share, or about $ 1.95 billion. The company also said it plans to buy back $ 500 million of its stock by August 1990. <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said the second dividend will be distributed as announced with the proposed record date in August.

 <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is attempting a hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, demanded Thursday that the instant-camera company extend the deadline on an offer to buy back its own stock. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, an investment company controlled by <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, nephew of the late animator <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, said the deadline for shareholders to accept <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 50-a-share offer for its own stock should be pushed past the May 9 date of the company's annual meeting.

 <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> and its top executives have settled a securities-fraud lawsuit brought by holders of company stock warrants and bonds that helped pay for completing the troubled <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, the utility announced Thursday. `` The company and the officers and directors have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing, but they have entered into the settlement to avoid further inconvenience, disruption, delay, expense and the uncertainty of further litigation,'' the company said in a statement. In part, the settlement would let the plaintiffs exercise warrants for purchasing <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> common stock, the company statement said. The suspension of the warrants in June 1986, five years before they were due to expire, prompted the lawsuit. `` I do n't know whether this will give -LRB- the plaintiffs -RRB- the same rights they had originally,'' before the warrants were suspended, company spokesman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said. He also could not say whether the warrant and bondholders got anything else in the settlement. `` Full details will be filed in <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the near future,'' <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said. The settlement is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s federal bankruptcy judge and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the southern district of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the case was set for trial next month. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> suspended the warrants as its finances worsened because of licensing delays for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> owns 36 percent of the project, which was completed in July 1986 but remains unlicensed because of emergency-planning and financial problems. Two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firms, Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Elliott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, L.P., filed the securities-fraud lawsuit about a month before <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sought bankruptcy protection in January 1988. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiffman </PERSON>, a lawyer for Spear, <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION>, said the firm sought to recover $ 7 million including punitive damages and lawyers' fees. The firms charged that <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> failed to give adequate notice that it had suspended the warrants, in an attempt to mislead investors and stall their attempts to seek relief. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued more than 18 million of the warrants along with $ 425 million in 17 -LCB- percent debentures in December 1984. The financing allowed <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to pull back from its first trip to the brink of bankruptcy and to complete <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>. Holders of the warrants were able to exchange each for one share of common stock by paying $ 5 cash or turning in debentures with $ 5 a face value. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firms said in legal briefs that they bought the warrants and debentures in 1987, unaware that the warrants had been suspended. The firms alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> failed to disclose the suspension in 1987 filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. If the settlement wins court approval, holders of the warrants would be able to exchange lots of 200 warrants and $ 1,000 worth of debentures for lots of 200 shares of common stock, the utility said in its statement. Cash exercise of the warrants would be barred. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it could not predict what the securities would be worth after the company emerges from bankruptcy protection.

 A stockbroker accused of bilking clients and banks of between $ 2 million and $ 5 million and then fleeing the country was ordered held without bail Friday pending trial. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> broker, was arrested last week re-entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at a remote <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> town after two weeks in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In denying bail, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> fled with two passports, an international driver's license, a plane ticket to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, valuable jewelry and the combination to a safe that has not been located. She also noted he carried $ 132,000 in cash when he was caught at the border and may have additional assets hidden abroad. `` I do not believe ... the court has a reasonable assurance that you will appear'' to face trial if released on bail, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> told <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>. `` Notwithstanding family, notwithstanding friends, you might leave. You have already done it once, and you might do it again,'' she said. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, 46, allegedly persuaded clients to invest money in his personal account rather than through the brokerage firm with the promise of 20 percent interest. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> converted the money to his own use. <PERSON> Mullin </PERSON> said the broker wrote six checks, each for $ 125,000 to $ 500,000, on overdrawn bank accounts. The prosecutor said the investment and bank frauds involved lossed of between $ 2 million and $ 5 million. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> is charged with one count of bank fraud and one count of mail fraud. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. No trial date was set. Defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was confused and upset about his financial problems when he left for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> but was overcome with remorse and decided to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` face the music.'' <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> said he would appeal the magistrate's decision.

During a two-day bail hearing, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> drove to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Feb. 1 after leaving a note to his wife saying he was going to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on business.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s key lending rate drove bond prices lower and short-term interest rates higher Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-inflation action pushed its discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to member banks, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent _ its highest level in about three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond tumbled about -RRB- point, or $ 3.75 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, jumped to 9.18 percent from 9.14 percent late Thursday, the highest level since September. Rates on short-term government bonds came under the most pressure. `` The short end got pretty well crushed right after the news'' of the discount-rate hike, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` It was just confirmation that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> really means business in terms of inflation. It confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has clearly tightened,'' he said. A hike in the discount rate normally drives short-term interest rates higher as some banks must borrow to meet reserve requirements. The discount rate is now at its highest level since April 1986. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues fell -LRB- point to 3-16 point, intermediate maturities declined \ point to 9-32 point and long-term issues lost 5-16 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.15 to 1,118.03. In corporate trading, industrials also retreated. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was down 0.41 at 295.54 In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds slipped -LRB- point to 9017-32. The average yield to maturity edged up to 7.73 percent from 7.72 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.94 percent as the discount climbed 7 basis points to 8.64 percent. Yields on six-month bills leaped to 9.21 percent as the discount jumped 7 basis points to 8.70 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.50 percent as the discount advanced 4 basis points to 8.77 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 913-16 percent, up from 911-16 percent late Thursday.

 The hole that tore open on a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 747 on Friday near <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was reminiscent of a near-disaster in the same area last year and seemed likely to become the latest in a series of public relations nightmares for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Problems with aging aircraft, miswired emergency systems in some newer planes, production delays on the giant 747-400 and a series of tragic crashes have focused unusual attention on the world's biggest maker of commercial jetliners, particularly in the past 60 days. `` What you have here is a series of events and the only correlation is that they're happening in the same time frame. But if you dissect each one you will find that they're totally unrelated,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that has prided itself on high-class workmanship and a strong safety record in its planes. He added, however, that with news reports of problems coming one after another, `` it does become one large blur to the public.'' `` It's made for a very intense period of being scrutinized, sometimes unfairly, and that's a difficult thing to counter because the incidents are happening ... and we do n't always have time to explain ourselves,'' <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said. There was no immediate word on the cause of Friday's incident, in which nine people apparently were sucked from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet when a 10-by-40-foot vertical hole opened in its fuselage. The flight had taken off a few minutes earlier for <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. It brought to mind an accident April 28, also over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. A flight attendant was killed and 61 people injured when a portion of the fuselage on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 peeled off during an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, exposing the first-class section to the open air at 24,000 feet. The pilot and co-pilot managed to land the jet although one of the two engines quit. In December, an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 with 104 passengers and six crew aboard was forced to land at <LOCATION> Yeager </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, after a 14-inch hole opened in its fuselage at 31,000 feet The first incident led to widespread concern about the safety of aging jets like the Aloha 737. Tiny cracks were found in nearly half the aging <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliners inspected in the months following the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident. More recently, a series of crashes focused attention on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jets: the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> 747 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, in which nearly 300 people on board and on the ground died; the January crash of a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 737 in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, killing 44 people; and the Feb. 8 crash of a chartered 707 in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>, which killed 144 people. But airlines have voted with their dollars in expressing their continuing confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> airplanes. All <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday ordered 20 new 747-400s in a deal valued at $ 3.1 billion. Orders in 1988 topped $ 30 billion for 636 planes, both record figures for the industry. But <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been plagued by various safety and production concerns of late: _ The company confirmed Wednesday that crossed tubes in cargo-hold fire-extinguisher systems were found in two Air Canada 767s The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 1 ordered checks on the plumbing and wiring of fire-suppressant and monitoring systems in cargo holds and engines of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes built since 1981. Over the past year, a total of 30 such problems have been found by airlines worldwide. The issue arose after the British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> crash, when investigators suspected that crossed wires may have led the pilot to shut down the wrong engine after a warning system indicated an engine fire. However, crossed wires subsequently were eliminated as a cause of that crash. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has said it is taking steps to find the cause of the problems and to make changes so they can not happen in the future. _ The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month that it had asked <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to determine whether inadequately tested nuts, bolts and rivets made by <ORGANIZATION> Voi-Shan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> were used in making aircraft Voi-Shan, of <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is being investigated over reports that test documents on the fasteners were falsified. _ Some major airlines have expressed anger at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> for delays in its 747-400 program and have said they will seek compensation for planes they will not receive on time <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> concedes it was too optimistic in putting together a timetable on the 747-400 program, but says that after delaying initial deliveries of the giant plane it is working to put the program back on track with no loss in quality. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also said earlier this month that it had hired a public relations firm, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Knowlton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The first sign of the PR firm's influence was when <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement expressing condolences over the 707 crash in the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> Feb. 8 _ the first time <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has issued such a statement before the cause of a crash was officially determined.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Friday petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a review of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' decision last fall to lay off about 4,000 employees and cut back service The pilots union said its petition `` will have implications for all Eastern asset transfers,'' including the pending sale of the airline's <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle service to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million in cash. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said the airline would have no comment on the petition because officials had not seen the documents. The pilots' announcement came amid mounting tension as a March 3 strike deadline against Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> set by its militant machinists union approaches. Intensified talks involving Eastern management, the machinists and federal mediators, which began Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, have so far failed to produce a settlement. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recommended Friday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intervene and block the planned strike, according to administration sources. The agency suggested <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> name a presidential emergency board to investigate the protracted dispute, the sources said. If the president accepted the recommendation it would automatically delay the strike by 60 days. Leaders of the union representing flight attendants at Eastern, meanwhile, voted unanimously Friday to ask members to honor a strike by the machinists. The leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union has polled its members on the strike issue. In its earlier court arguments against the layoffs and reduced service, the pilots union had asserted it was not an efficiency move, but part of a `` continuing pattern of anti-labor tactics designed to intimidate employees in the midst of ongoing labor negotiations.'' Last August, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued a restraining order against the Eastern plan. The airline appealed, and in late September a three-member appeals court panel overturned the restraining order. The pilots union's request to have the case heard by the full 11-member appeals court was rejected in early January.
