<HEAD>Federal Auditors Searching For $7 Million in Denver HUD Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than $ 7 million in proceeds from the sale of foreclosed homes may be missing from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> and Development's regional office here, federal auditors say. However, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s regional chief said the files that will account for the money are simply in storage and are being recovered. The <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> office is a major focus of a nationwide inquiry of wrongdoing at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration under then-Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. The agency has been rocked by allegations that money to rehabilitate run-down housing for the poor and elderly was handed out to developers who hired high-priced consultants with ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or the administration. In addition, an escrow agent in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> has said she embezzled $ 5 million in money due the government from the sale of foreclosed property and gave most of the proceeds to the poor. Investigators have dubbed <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> `` Robin <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' An auditor's report released Tuesday raised the possibility that the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> office may not have received $ 7,279,136. Federal auditors have given the office eight days to come up with the missing records on 173 foreclosed homes sold in the past five years, or face sanctions. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regional officials knew the files were missing as early as Feb. 9, according to the report by the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's office The report indicates the investigation into single-family home sales handled by the office began in January. The report said 471 home sales were chosen by auditors for review, but records on 173 could n't be found. According to the report, documentation that proceeds were transferred to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> bank accounts was lacking for many other sales. <PERSON> Isaiah </PERSON> `` Ike'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> administrator in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said the files, which have been missing since February, are stored in agency's archives. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said the audit covered home sales from 1984 to 1988. `` I do n't know what happened back then, but I can tell you that as acting administrator I will make sure the regional inspector general obtains those files immediately,'' said <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, who took over in April. Earlier this month, a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> accountant in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, was suspended on suspicion of diverting $ 1 million to his own account. The auditors' report accused regional officials of lax record-keeping. Auditors complained they found active and inactive files together and that boxes of records were allowed to sit open at the regional office for indefinite periods before being put in storage. The report also criticized the practice of not requiring private agents who sell foreclosed properties for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to confirm that proceeds were deposited in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> bank accounts. Normally when a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> home is sold, the proceeds are wired immediately to the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office `` Of the 256 sales packages examined, 145 did not have wire transfer confirmations,'' the report said.

 Two black candidates won races for judgeships Tuesday in an election ordered by a federal judge who said <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s judicial districts discriminated against blacks. One other black candidate was narrowly leading, one was trailing and two others lost election bids. Two blacks were unopposed as a result of the court order that forced the redrawing of judicial districts. Prior to the election, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> had four black judges. Also on the ballot were three proposed constitutional amendments to repeal outdated and unused provisions. One would eliminate the poll tax, adopted to discourage black voting but struck down by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1966. The four blacks among <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s 78 judges are <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, Circuit Judges <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmon-Sanders </PERSON> and Chancery Judge <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. Each was appointed to fill a vacancy, but <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> went on to win a full eight-year term in 1986. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> did not seek election this year. The two others sought regular terms Tuesday. With 79 of 85 precincts reporting Tuesday night, <ORGANIZATION> Blackmon-Sanders </ORGANIZATION> trailed <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> challenger <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> by 8,265 votes to 10,917. Banks and one other black Democrat, <PERSON> Isadore </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, were unopposed in the general election. The two black winners were <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, a Democrat, who defeated Republican <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> for an open <LOCATION> Hinds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chancery judge's post by 5,942 votes to 1,638; and <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, also Democrat, who defeated Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> in another open family court post in the county, 4,628 votes to 1,259 With only five of 37 precincts reporting in the Fourth District, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, a black Democrat, was leading independent incumbent Circuit Judge <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> in the Fourth District, 395 votes to 348. But <PERSON> Clell </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a black Democrat, was defeated by independent incumbent Circuit Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the Fourth District, 4,046 votes to 2,063. Another black candidate, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON>, also a Democrat, ran fourth in a four-way race for two judgeship posts in the 20 Circuit Court District. The winners were incumbents <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goza </PERSON>, a Democrat, and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a Republican. In 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ruled that the state's judicial districts discriminated against blacks. The ruling, the first to apply the 1965 Voting Rights Act to judicial elections, was upheld on appeal. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> ordered some districts redrawn to create minority subdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity to elect black judges. The ruling and appeals put judicial elections in the state on hold until this year, when all 69 <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeships are being filled. No Supreme Court judgeships are on the ballot.

 The Senate Foreign Relations Committee postponed action on three of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ambassadorial nominees Tuesday after Democrats complained their only visible qualifications are large <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contributions. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., initiated the delay when he complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors should have at least some qualifications for the job The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is set to close down for the Independence Day recess, so <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>' request for a one-week delay effectively stops until mid July at the earliest any action on the nominations to fill ambassadorships in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. `` In the past we've had to hold our noses'' and let similar nominees with political connections go through, <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. `` But eventually someone ought to say stop.'' `` If it's going to be a bidding war ... at least we should put it up for public bids so the money goes to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> targeted three. They are: _ <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> land developer and national co-chairman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fund raising committee who has been nominated to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said he contributed $ 126,000 to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. _ <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sembler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> shopping center tycoon who has been named to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sembler </PERSON> was a $ 127,000 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contributor. _ <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, residential real estate broker who has been nominated to be ambassador to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> She is a long-time personal friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> For President Committee. <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said she had no apparent qualifications except her personal and political ties. `` There seems to be a $ 100,000 threshhold'' for ambassadorships, <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> did `` reluctantly'' permit the committee to approve the nomination of <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a $ 115,000 contributor to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> has been named to be ambassador to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and with the committee's action, an ambassador will be in place when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visits the country next month. The full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later approved the <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> nomination on a voice vote. Sen. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., defended the records of the two Floridians on <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>' list saying, `` to imply they are not capable is a disservice. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said: `` What we're doing is delaying the appropriate representation this country should have overseas.'' And Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., said the overall composition of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ambassadorial nominees to date is no different than the choices of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's two-thirds <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> professionals and one third political appointees `` These nominees are friends of the president, a part of the organization of his coming to the presidency,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` They share his ethos, his idealism and they will be so perceived in the nations to which they are being sent.'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said he has no objection to political nominees as such, as long as they can claim some qualifications for the posts to which they are named. He noted he did not object to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of former Republican Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> had demonstrated his capabilities during his eight years service as governor beginning in 1980. The committee did vote to recommend the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirm <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and a list of other nominees. They are: _ <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Niles </PERSON>, named to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative to the European Community _ <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON>, to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ney </PERSON>, to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, to be assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Affairs _ <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitsky </PERSON>, to be assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters _ Jewel <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafontant </PERSON>, to be ambassador-at-large for refugee affairs _ E <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Coady </PERSON>, to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> executive director for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, to be deputy administrator of the Agency for International Development _ <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeder </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, to be president of the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>

 The technology behind the Walkman portable cassette-player might never have developed without these words from <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>: `` TURN DOWN THAT MUSIC!'' <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, seeking to soften his children's blasting stereos, asked his development team for something that would let the kids rock out without deafening dad. Working from a model developed by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Masuru </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibuka </PERSON>, model TPS-L2 rolled off the assembly line a year later _ the first <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walkman </ORGANIZATION>, unveiled July 1, 1979. In the decade since, the Walkman and its imitators have become ubiquitous, with tiny headphones appearing on millions of heads worldwide _ traffic-bound commuters, long-distance runners and house-cleaning parents as well as their rock' n' rolling kids. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walkman </ORGANIZATION> has in fact changed the way the world listens to music,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's changed our lifestyles.'' Go argue. As the Walkman marks its 10th birthday, it has become a cultural phenomenon, as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> as Toyotas or sushi. Highlights of the Walkman's first decade include: _ Walkman: A Space Odyssey. A specially adapted Walkman was sent into orbit attached to astronaut <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, recording the sounds of his bowels for posterity. This was a scientific experiment -LRB- really -RRB-. _ Illegal Walkman. Teachers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> were warned of students using Walkmans -LRB- Walkmen? -RRB- to play `` oral crib sheets'' during tests. _ Walkman: The Movie. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, blasting an <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON> guitar solo through a Walkman, convinced his'50s - bound father there was life on other planets in `` Back to the Future _ The Royal Walkman. Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> owns a gold-plated number that she plays while relaxing in Buckingham Palace. The Walkman was n't an immediate sensation. Initially it was called Soundabout in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Stowaway in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, Freestyle in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and Walkman in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other world markets. But <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> argued for uniformity, and sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 37,000 units in 1979, took off after the Walkman name was adopted in May 1980. From then on, the personal stereo cassette deck was up and running. `` Retailers told us, ` You guys are absolutely out of your minds. It does n't even recod, and it costs $ 200. It's never going to go anywhere,''' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` The next thing I know, we've got back orders for 1 -LCB- years.'' Dozens of competitors from <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> recognized a good thing and began manufacturing their own brands. By 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> was hailing the Walkman as the gadget of the year. By 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> had cranked out 10 million which climbed to 30 million by 1987. Today, there are more than 50 million _ about half of them worn in the U.S.A. While the first model had a retail price of $ 199.95, today's Walkman prices run as low as $ 14.95 for an FM, radio-only model There are 44 <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> models: water-resistant, with AM-FM radios, with recording capability, built for the outdoorsman. Television freaks now have the Watchman, a tiny portable TV set; die-hard audiophiles have the Discman, a portable CD player. Meanwhile, the trademarked Walkman name entered everyday language as a synonym for a personal stereo, just as Kleenex came to stand for a facial tissue. Walkman is even an entry in the dictionary. Birthday celebrations for the Walkman include one of the originals going on permanent display at the <LOCATION> Hard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cafe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s will produce 36 special Walkmans to be presented to as-yet-unchosen innovators in music and technology.

<TEXT>
 The government says <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has nearly completed construction of a 6-foot barbed wire fence along its border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but cast doubt on a foreign press report that a brick wall is being built. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Monday reported that <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> is building a wall along its border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> to prevent defections. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Tuesday that its border guards had reported `` no signs of wall construction.'' `` Nevertheless, a 2 -LCB- - meter wire fence is being set up on the Romanian side of the border ... which has been completed along 90 percent of the border length,'' the agency said `` Since it appears to be an ordinary wire fence, the -LRB- Hungarian -RRB- border guards suppose that no electricity will be led into it,'' the agency said. It added that the fence is about 80 feet inside Romanian territory. `` The latest works indicate that ditches have been dug on both sides of the fence to prevent breakthroughs by cars,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> extends 275 miles. An estimated 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians, have fled to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the past few years seeking refuge from chronic hardships under the regime of President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>.

 After years of crusades to stop poachers from destroying the African elephant, conservationists are reaping success with a series of national bans on ivory imports. `` It's been a real snowball effect,'' said <PERSON> Jorgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomsen </PERSON>, senior program officer for elephant conservation at the World Wildlife Fund. Since June 4, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have imposed bans on imported ivory. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> buy up to 75 percent of the ivory on world markets. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the world's major ivory dealer, has announced a moratorium on raw ivory imports. The 102-nation Convention on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> will consider a worldwide ban at a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting in October. The conservationists' sweeping success follows June 1 appeals by the World Wildlife Fund and Wildlife Conservation International. The two groups said poachers were wiping out the elephant populations in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> faster than had been thought and the pachyderms could be extinct within 15 years. But conservationists now fear that prospects of a worldwide ban could lead poachers to a frenzy of elephant killings unless interim measures are taken immediately. `` An elephant holocaust across <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is likely unless consumer countries take immediate action,'' the World Wildlife Fund said. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, on June 4, began the string of national actions against importing ivory and it was followed the next day by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Penalties vary for violations. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the maximum is a year in jail and a $ 100,000 fine. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in announcing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision, said: `` We do this out of mounting concern for the rapid decline of the wild elephant, one of nature's most majestic creatures. `` If their populations continue to diminish at current rates, the wild elephant will soon be lost from this Earth.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> are considered critical to any effective reduction in ivory demand. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the largest importer, accounting for 40 percent of the world market, and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is heavily involved in making ivory carvings for export. `` The real victory is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thomsen </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s action was very much to save face'' because its two biggest customers _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ had outlawed imports. `` This proves that we have taken more responsibility as consumer countries,'' he said. `` We may have prevented a catastrophe. Credit should also be placed with the <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries, who previously had opposed a ban but now realize the crisis situation.'' <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> began enforcing its crackdown quickly. On Sunday, it seized 448 tusks and other ivory products worth an estimated $ 2.6 million that officials said were to to have been smuggled to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Several African countries recently reversed their stands and took steps to protect their elephants. Last month, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> followed neighboring <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> and called for a worldwide ban. Delegates at an Organization of African Unity conference that ended Saturday recommended establishing a marketing cartel to ensure that money from the worldwide ivory trade benefits the continent. Conservationists estimate African elephant populations have dropped from 1.5 million in 1978 to between 400,000 and 700,000 today. They say ivory exports have increased from 300 tons a year in the 1950s to more than 800 tons annually in this decade and prices are running at a record $ 91 per pound. An aerial survey last year found about 20,000 elephants in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. Fifteen years ago it had 121,000. The number of elephants in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> has fallen to 80,000 from 300,000 in 1979, according to government officials. Conservationists say the elephant populations in most other African countries have suffered similar fates, but <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are the exceptions because of controls. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> has annual elephant kills and a thriving legal trade in elephant products. In the last 12 months it earned about $ 600,000 in legal ivory sales. Poachers have killed most of the big male elephants in some countries and now their targets are females and young beasts, according to a conservationists' report released this month. The result is that three times as many elephants must be killed to provide the same amount of ivory as 10 years ago. `` The annual ivory haul must be reduced to at least a tenth of its present volume to enable populations to recover,'' the report says. `` The recovery of herds and family structure will take 20 years or more if all poaching were stopped.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and other countries with thriving ivory industries and markets would be badly hurt if supplies are reduced to that level. <PERSON> Tamotsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishibashi </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ivory </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said even the current ban will have devastating effects on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s traditional ivory-carving industry. He said some 25,000 craftsman in about 80 workshops produce $ 13.8 million worth of ivory products every year. `` The majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of carving ivory from generation to generation, and the new restriction certainly will affect them severely,'' he said.

 Swedes may not learn the name or see the face of the man accused of killing Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> if they read only their national newspapers. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who is on trial for the 1986 shooting, is known in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> only as `` the 42-year-old.'' Under Swedish press law, the identity of a criminal suspect is never published unless he is convicted and sentenced, and even then it must clearly be in the public interest. The regulations are meant to protect the innocent, and a newspaper and its senior editor can be fined for violating them. But the Palme murder trial has put the regulations under a strain, and several provincial papers are disregarding them. `` <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> is a historic person, whether guilty or not,'' said <PERSON> Per </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlstrom </PERSON>, editor of Nya Norrland, a daily with a circulation of 20,000 in the northern town of <LOCATION> Harnosand </LOCATION>. `` I find that there is evident public interest that the name of the person accused of the murder becomes public knowledge,'' he said. International news agencies and foreign newspapers published <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s identity and his police mug shot when he was charged in December. Swedish papers ran into difficulty when <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, known as `` the 41-year-old'' at the time, had a birthday in April. For a few weeks he was referred to as `` the 42-year-old former 41-year-old.'' About 20 newspapers have flouted the regulations, arguing it was ridiculous to try to hide his identity when foreign newspapers reporting the trial were available at major newsstands in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Other ironies also have become evident. Under Swedish freedom of information laws, <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s name was available after prosecutors filed the indictment last month. Anyone who calls the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> can ask the court clerk to read it over the telephone. Papers that have refrained from identifying <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> have, at the same time, published every detail of his life, including his police record, the location of his home and interviews with former girlfriends. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, director of the London-based `` Article 19,'' which monitors press freedom in 50 countries, said the Swedish regulations are `` highly exceptional'' if not unique. `` It is remarkable in that it contradicts the openness of information in so many other areas where <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> leads the world,'' <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said in an interview. He said the restrictions do not violate international law, but they could inhibit the search for witnesses. Because of high public interest in the Palme case, the court let <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> broadcast the trial with a one-second delay to allow a technician to cover <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s name with an electronic beep. The technician missed the beat the first time <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s name was mentioned, however. The broadcasts have been debated heatedly. Professor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Elwing </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lund </ORGANIZATION> said they have turned the trial into `` marketplace theater'' and diminished the stature of the court. `` I would have acted forcefully to stop it,'' <PERSON> Elwing </PERSON> said. Some critics said testimony heard on the radio could influence subsequent witnesses. Presiding Judge <PERSON> Carl-Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Spak </PERSON> ruled the broadcasts were in line with the law and would be stopped only if they disturbed the trial itself. Since then most of the witnesses, many of whom have criminal records, have demanded that the broadcast be halted for their testimony and the court has complied. Press Ombudsman <PERSON> Torsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Cars </PERSON>, who is employed by the newspaper industry, said the caution regarding <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>'s name goes beyond the requirements of press ethics. `` It would not change much if the name were printed, considering all the descriptions of his life that already have been published,'' he said. `` And there are thousands of <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Petterssons </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. ... Publishing the picture is more serious.'' Among those publishing the name is the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Arbetet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Malmo </LOCATION>, a city across the <LOCATION> Oregrund </LOCATION> straits from <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, where such restrictions do not apply. <PERSON> Arbetet </PERSON> was convicted of libel in 1987 and ordered to pay $ 27,000 in compensation to `` the 33-year-old,'' a suspect who earlier was detained and released without charges.

 A 19th-century painting set in ancient <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> of a young woman about to bathe has been sold at auction for $ 153,450 _ nearly 20,000 times its 1956 purchase price of $ 8. `` It certainly does reflect an extraordinary change in taste, but that is n't unique in art,'' said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> after the sale Tuesday of `` Diadumene'' by Sir <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Poynter </PERSON>. The auction house had expected more because of the vogue for once-neglected Victorian works. It had estimated the painting would fetch up to $ 232,500. <PERSON> Poynter </PERSON>, in 1885, had painted the young woman nude but he added diaphanous drapery after it was exhibited at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and provoked letters from shocked viewers. One letter to the press, signed `` British Matron,'' said the writer had barred her daughters from going to the the exhibition. Another letter said the painting would produce a `` burning sense of shame'' in any `` modest woman on the arm of father, brother or lover.'' <PERSON> Poynter </PERSON> was known for such paintings but his most famous work, reproduced in the tens of thousands in its day, was `` Faithful unto Death.'' It depicted a Roman sentry staying at his post during the destruction of <LOCATION> Pompeii </LOCATION> by the Vesuvius volcano. The seller and buyer of `` Diadumene'' were not identified. The painting had been auctioned in 1956 at a sale of the contents of <LOCATION> Ashley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>, owned by <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> Chichester </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon-Hartland </PERSON>. Top price at Tuesday's auction of 19th century European art was $ 2.3 million _ more than double the estimate _ paid anonymously for `` Grandfather's Birthday,'' a family fireside scene by Austrian artist <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldmueller </PERSON>. It was a record for his work.

 A heartbroken husband shot and killed his estranged wife Tuesday in their divorce attorney's office, then turned the gun on himself as the couple's two young girls sat in the waiting room. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 38, shot his wife <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>, also 38, four times in the head with a .32 - caliber revolver, threatened to shoot the attorney, then shot himself in the head, according to police and the attorney's Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was declared dead at <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was in extremely poor condition at the same hospital and will likely be declared brain dead after tests are completed Wednesday, said administrative nursing supervisor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. The couple, who had been married since 1973, had come to the office of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> on Tuesday afternoon for an initial consultation about a divorce, according to <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON>'s secretary, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dasaro </PERSON> They went into the attorney's office and closed the door, leaving their 8-year-old and 6-year-old girls in the reception area. `` The father told them to wait out here,'' <PERSON> Dasaro </PERSON> said. `` She said she no longer loved him; he said he loved her a great deal,'' <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON> said afterward. <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON> said he served the divorce summons on <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and told him to get an attorney. `` Then he stood up, put his right hand behind his back and pulled out a gun,'' <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON> said. `` She sat down, she pleaded for her life.'' He put the gun, identified by police as a .32 - caliber, against her left temple and fired <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> then alternated between firing additional shots into Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and threatening him, shoving the gun against <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON>'s chest, head and mouth. `` He then said he was going to kill me and kill himself,'' <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON>, 58, said. After about five minutes, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> put the gun to his face and shot himself. `` We heard the gunshots and at first we did n't know what it was'' since the office is located near a busy intersection, <PERSON> Dasaro </PERSON> said. `` After the third one that I heard, we realized that it was coming from the office. `` We ran out and we dragged the little girls out.'' <PERSON> Dasaro </PERSON> said they waited outside the office on the street about 10 minutes before <PERSON> Napolitano </PERSON> emerged. `` I thought <PERSON> John </PERSON> was dead too,'' she said. `` Then he came out and he just shook his head.'' The girls `` did not witness the murder,'' she said, but were `` crying hysterically.'' One saw the bodies being carried out. A 12-year-old son was not at the office at the time, said Officer <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The children will probably be turned over to child welfare workers, he said.

 Picket lines in the 7-week-old strike at <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>'s posh restaurant, Tavern on the Green, came down Tuesday after striking workers tentatively accepted a five-year contract. `` We're delighted,'' said restaurant spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>. `` We think it's a fair settlement, we're glad that it's over and we want to see all of our regular customers back here as soon as possible.'' Under the offer, wages will increase 27 percent the first year and about 5 percent each of the four years that follow. `` A 27 percent raise the first year is not a bad wage increase,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turchiano </PERSON>, a spokesman for Local 6 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. The union represented nearly 300 dishwashers, busboys, waiters and other workers who walked off the job April 30.

Tavern on the Green is a tourist mecca, known for its glittering garden, rococo decor and posh banquets.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> completed a 52-week sweep of Nielsen ratings despite <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' broadcast of the final game of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pistons </ORGANIZATION>' sweep of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> championship <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' was the No. 1 show last week, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average, prime-time rating of 11.6. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had 10.2 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 9.2. The last time <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> lost a week was to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, the week of the seventh game of last year's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> championship, when the <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> Pistons </ORGANIZATION>. This year, game four ranked fourth in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> prime-time ratings, with a 17.4 rating and 31 share. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s average rating for the 52 weeks was 14.4. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> tied with 11.6. The top 10 shows during the past year were: `` Roseanne'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` 60 Minutes'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` Empty Nest'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Dear John'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and `` Murder, She Wrote'' CBS. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has had eight of the top 10 shows 10 times during the past year. `` Cosby'' was first in the Nielsens for 16 of the 52 weeks, but ranked second behind `` Roseanne'' for the year _ and third behind `` Roseanne'' and `` Cheers'' last week. `` Cosby'' had a lower rating and higher share, because it is on at 8 p.m. EDT, when there are fewer people watching TV than at 9 p.m., when `` Roseanne'' is on. The rating is a percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that have televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. A show can have a lower rating and higher share than another show by getting a larger percentage of a smaller available audience. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said another reason `` Cosby'' fell behind `` Roseanne'' for the year was because the newer <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> show did not have to factor in a summer of reruns. The top 10 shows last week were: `` Roseanne'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pistons </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>: The Case of the Murdered Madam'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` A Different World'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Empty Nest'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Dear John'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Golden Girls'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, and `` Unsolved Mysteries'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, tied with `` Newhart'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. In a demonstration that time period makes the show, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Have Faith'' tied for 15th when it was on Tuesday behind `` Roseanne.'' But when it was moved into <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s low-rated Sunday lineup, it fell to 76th and was the lowest-rated network show. `` NBC Nightly News'' continued to lag in news ratings, even with anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` CBS Evening News'' and `` ABC World News Tonight'' tied for first place with a 9.3 rating each and 20 share each. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average rating of 8.6 and a 19 share.

 A campaign of terror by the South African-led police threatens free and fair independence elections in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> asserts. Namibian police in armored cars mounted with heavy machine guns reportedly drive through villages destroying crops and terrorizing inhabitants, the official, <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, wrote in a letter obtained Tuesday. `` Their activities appear to have created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation among much of the population in the northern region,'' he wrote <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s administrator-general in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> The letter said a feared counterinsurgency unit called `` Koevoet,'' Afrikaans for crowbar, is behind the terror campaign. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> sent the letter on June 9. No reply has been received, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> is leading a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission monitoring <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s cooperation with a U.N.-mediated plan to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from 74 years of South African rule November elections for the territory's first black majority-ruled government are scheduled under the independence plan.

 Hispanics flooded into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and accounted for about one-fourth of the nation's total population growth in the first half of this decade, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports. Those states and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> each now have more than 1 million Hispanics, the bureau said in its first detailed analysis of minority populations since the 1980 census. Sixteen states, led by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, had more than 1 million blacks as of 1985, while <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had the most Hispanics and other minorities, the study found. Blacks comprise the nation's largest minority at 28.9 million, the study reported. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had the largest black population at 2.7 million, followed by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with 2.1 million blacks. But the black population of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was growing faster, adding 243,000 between 1980 and 1985, compared to a 219,000 increase for the Empire State. The nation's Hispanic population jumped from 14.3 million in 1980 to 17.5 million in 1985 through a combination of high birth rates and international migration. Although they were only 6.3 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population in 1980, <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> made up about one-fourth of the 12 million national population increase during the next half-decade, the report said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has the largest Hispanic population, the report showed, at 5.9 million _ one-third of all Hispanics in the nation. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was second at 3.7 million followed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 1.9 million and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with 1.1 million. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> added 1.3 million Hispanics between 1980 and 1985, while <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> gained 700,000. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> also added more than 100,000 Hispanics each. Among states with a million or more blacks the fastest growth rate for that group, 16 percent, was posted by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> had the largest proportion of blacks in its population, 36 percent, the report found, followed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 31 percent, and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, 30 percent. During the first half of this decade only <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> had a decline in black population. More than four out of five blacks reside in metropolitan areas, the bureau found.

<HEAD>Democrats Failing to Highlight Family Issues, Consultant Says</HEAD>

 Democrats are failing to capitalize on family issues such as child care at the polls because they are `` afraid to take on the tax consequences'' of programs that voters say they support, a party consultant says. But a Republican strategist warned women's groups that even though child care has emerged as an important campaign issue in recent years, `` there are a lot of folks who just do n't care about the issue.'' <PERSON> Celinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, a Democratic expert on electing women candidates, and <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>, a former campaign strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans before becoming President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief pollster for the 1988 campaign, appeared on a panel at a meeting held by child care advocates Tuesday. Panelist <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an associate professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said a February poll by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> showed 87 percent approval for a joint government and private effort to meet child care needs. She said 55 percent of those responding to a CBS News poll in February said the federal government had a responsibility to help parents pay for child care if they could n't afford it. <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>, however, said the most recent White House polls show that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s child care program, built around a tax credit, has about 5 percent to 6 percent more support than congressional legislation calling for direct government financing. Ms. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> told the group that family issues `` ought to work very well for Democrats. They are policy issues where people want spending and they want it now, not later. They want government involvement.'' `` We as Democrats have not drawn strong enough political lines on this issue,'' the consultant said. `` Democrats have tended to talk about small cost ... and all this has done is lose the punch of these issues because we have been afraid to take on the tax consequences, the regulatory consequences, of these programs, and in fact voters think these issues are going to take big programs.'' <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON> said such family issues as child care first surfaced in political campaigns in 1986. `` I had candidates who were beaten on those kinds of issues,'' he said. `` They were beaten because, with my stupid advice, they talked about national themes and ideology. Well, national themes and ideology did n't sell in 1986. Concern over nuclear waste and child care did. We were wrong, they were right, and we lost many <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats.'' However, he cautioned the group, `` There are a lot of folks out there who feel strongly about it, but I must tell you this: there are a lot of folks who just do n't care.'' Both consultants agreed that family issues will have significant impact in next year's congressional elections. `` I do n't believe serious political candidates in 1990 can avoid discussing the issue of child care,'' <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe they can avoid discussing the issue of long-term health care. However, he said he did not believe parental leave would be an issue. Ms. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> predicted all three would be major issues, particularly if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes child care and parental leave legislation and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoes it on top of his veto of the recent bill raising the minimum wage. <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` doing pretty well'' with women voters, but `` If there is a whole series of vetoes on legislation that is of particular importance to women, that could be a different ballgame.'' The panel was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition seeking a national system of child care combining public and private resources; the Great American Family Tour, a non-profit, non-partisan organization dealing with family policy issues, headed by Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>.; and <ORGANIZATION> Lifetime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, a venture of <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> @ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Viacom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which produce a documentary entitled `` Hush Little Baby: The Challenge of Child Care.

The academy, highlighted in the sisters' book, `` The Standard Book of Dog Grooming,'' draws students from around the country. The school is n't cheap: $ 795 for a four-week groomer's assistant course, up to $ 2,995 for a 16-week master course. Students scrub dogs in tubs, cut their hair and dry it with a blow dryer or a heated cage dryer. The finishing touch includes ribbons, scarves or bells. <PERSON> Fenger </PERSON> said she also teaches students how to handle the dogs, including touching the animals in specific places to control and relax them.

 Government handouts have come a long way since the federal government doled out surplus cheese. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, they're giving away toilets. This summer, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, hoping to promote an ethic of water conservation, is handing out 2,500 low-flow toilets to communities for public use. The Municipal Toilet Replacement Program is designed with the hope that after residents try the toilets at their town hall or public library they will buy one for their home, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lissack </PERSON>, a spokesman for the program. The toilets cost the authority $ 350,000. The authority needs to save water to continue adequately supplying water to 2.5 million people in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area. Toilets consume an average of 38 percent of household water. Conventional toilets use 3.5 gallons to 7 gallons per flush; the model being given away uses 1.6 gallons or less. Starting March 2, the state will require that all new toilets use no more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush, which is expected to save more than 3 million gallons of water daily.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s sentencing is postponed while the judge considers defense charges that one of the Iran-Contra jurors who convicted the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide deliberately lied during jury selection. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> postponed Friday's scheduled sentencing after <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers produced evidence that juror <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> failed to disclose that a brother had been convicted of armed robbery and that two others had arrest records The defense also alleged that Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s statements to reporters after the verdict that she used marijuana and cocaine before the trial suggests she was under the influence of drugs during the trial. Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> told interviewers that she did not use drugs during her jury service. The judge on Tuesday postponed sentencing until July 5 and scheduled a June 28 hearing on defense allegations that Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> intentionally withheld the information when she filled out a questionnaire given to prospective jurors. The questionnaire asked if any member of her family had ever been a party or witness to a civil or criminal court proceeding or had been under investigation by law enforcement authorities. The 35-year-old office worker answered the question in the negative. `` This apparently intentional misstatement raises serious questions as to juror bias and impartiality,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said in pleadings that were unsealed Tuesday by the judge. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> might be forced to grant a mistrial if the defense can prove that it learned after the verdict that Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> deliberately withheld information to get on the jury. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, in other pleadings ordered unsealed, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his lawyers must prove that they learned about Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s misstatements after the verdict. Otherwise, his motion `` ` constitutes an impermissible attempt to sandbag the judicial process,''' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said, quoting from a 1982 appellate court decision. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> gave <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers until Friday to state `` the precise date and time when counsel first learned each fact.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also argued that Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> may have inadvertently answered the question incorrectly, noting that she is nearly 17 years younger than the brother convicted of armed robbery in 1987. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said it was possible that `` any knowledge she did have simply did not come to mind at the time she completed the jury questionnaire,'' particularly since Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> has 14 brothers and sisters. During the trial, the defense did not seek to replace two jurors with alternates following media reports that they had failed to disclose involvements in lawsuits arising from traffic accidents. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also contended there was no evidence that Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> was biased against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` If King developed any prejudice'' from her brothers' trouble with law enforcement, `` it would likely be directed against the prosecution, not defendants,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. North, 45, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, faces a possible 10-year sentence. The jury convicted North of aiding and abetting the obstruction of a congressional inquiry into the Iran-Conta affair, destroying or altering official documents and accepting an illegal gratuity _ the installation of a security fence outside his home by arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>. North was acquitted of nine other charges.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and other big oil companies say they'll spend $ 250 million over five years to sharpen their ability to combat massive oil spills, and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is stepping up surveillance of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil system. The major oil companies, in their first comprehensive step to improve contingency planning for big spills, said Tuesday they will create a nationwide network of response teams capable of handling an accident as large as the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> disaster anywhere on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastal waters. The plan is voluntary, which environmental groups and some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said minimizes its importance and underscores the need for federal legislation to require better response capabilities. `` When it comes to the protection of our fragile environment, ` good faith' simply is not good enough,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. He said he will introduce legislation Thursday to increase oil companies' financial liability for oil spills. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the government will begin a comprehensive safety inspection of the 800-mile <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline later this month, two years earlier than scheduled, as a precautionary measure. `` The Exxon Valdez oil spill has taught us a valuable lesson: the need to avoid complacency when it comes to protecting our environment,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee approved a bill providing a range of spill-prevention actions, including randam alcohol testing of oil tanker crews. The bill, backed by Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, would open highway driving records of merchant mariners to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, provide for alcohol testing of people in safety-sensitive jobs on tankers and improve radar systems to aid in tracking ships through potentially hazardous areas. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored development of the industry's new spill-response plan, said it is not designed to head off legislation to force more responsibility on the companies. `` We want to move forward regardless of what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does,'' he told a news conference. The industry plan includes measures aimed at preventing future disasters and establishing clearer lines of government authority for reacting to tanker accidents. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and head of a special task force that produced the plans after two months of study, said the industry hopes to have the new system in full operation within a year. Environmental groups generally welcomed the program but said they want to see it implemented before assessing its long-term importance. `` It's a good step,'' said <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based environmental group. `` They're finally recognizing that the country is aroused and outraged, and they're responding because they have to.'' A key to success of the new system, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said, is giving the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> full responsibility for deciding when industry cleanup crews will be called into action. Current lines of authority between state and federal agencies are unclear, he said. `` Somebody has to be able to be in charge and not have to make a conference call, and we think that should be the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it needs time to study the plan before commenting. The plan will cost more than $ 250 million over the first five years, adding one-twentieth of 1 cent a year to the oil companies' cost of making a gallon of gasoline, said <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said the added expense will not be tacked onto gas prices at the pump. `` It's a cost of doing business for the industry _ we'll absorb it,'' he said. The plan will: _ Establish a <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Response </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> headquartered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and regional `` response centers'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Each center will be staffed around the clock by trained cleanup specialists and will be equipped to handle a 30,000-ton oil spill _ about the same as the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> spill. _ Set up `` staging areas'' at 19 sites nationwide where response equipment, such as oil skimmer boats and chemical dispersants, will be stored _ Spend $ 30 million to $ 35 million over five years on industry research programs to study the effects of oil spills on the environment, ways of minimizing the effects on shorelines and techniques for recovering oil from the water

 <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a black man whose conviction by an all-white jury provoked cries of racism by his attorneys, was put to death in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s gas chamber early Wednesday. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 36, convicted of murdering a convenience store clerk during a 1980 crime spree, lost two appeals just hours before the execution. He was pronounced dead at 12:15 a.m. at the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> State Penitentiary here. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, by a 7-2 vote, had denied <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' request for a stay Tuesday. Earlier Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> halted the execution of a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> man convicted of killing an elderly couple. Shortly after that, a federal judge in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> granted a stay of execution for his accomplice. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Laws </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, 42, had been scheduled to die early Wednesday morning. The high court's ruling in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> case was followed two hours later by a statement from Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> saying he refused to grant clemency for <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. `` I have reviewed the facts in the case of <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, and I will not stand in the way of the court's justice,'' the governor said. `` The facts are that <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> is a mass murderer who killed in cold blood, he tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the courts, and discrimination had no bearing on his case. `` This is not casual justice. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' sentence is a result of his own crime, and his fate now rests in God's hands,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, was convicted on April 1, 1981 in the death of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> convenience store clerk <PERSON> Linzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> during a robbery. The robbery and killing were committed after <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> escaped from a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> prison. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> went on a five-day robbery spree that left three store clerks dead and two wounded in Hinds and <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> counties.

<HEAD>Nuts May Help Prevent Heart Attack Deaths, Study Shows</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A handful of nuts a day may keep the heart attack away, according to a group of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> researchers. A six-year study of diet and fatal coronary heart disease among 34,000 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Seventh-Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adventists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> found that nuts were the only food item listed with a statistically significant protection against heart attack death. `` Compared to a person who never ate nuts, a person who ate them at least once a day had only 47 percent of the risk'' of fatal heart attack, said Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, co-author of a study presented Tuesday at the 2nd <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preventive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiology </ORGANIZATION>. `` Making this even more significant is that a year ago we looked at non-fatal -LRB- heart attacks -RRB- and got findings that were extremely similar,'' said <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>. `` Nuts seem to reduce the risk of both fatal and non-fatal heart disease.'' The researcher cautioned that the study is from only one population group and `` should be interpreted as an interesting, but still somewhat preliminary finding'' until other studies are done. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said the data was collected through questionnaires mailed between 1976 and 1982. In a follow-up study, the researchers found there had been 260 fatal heart attacks among those surveyed earlier. The scientists then compared answers on the dietary questionnaires to determine what foods, if any, tended to suggest protection against heart disease. `` Significant protective relationships were seen with consumption of whole wheat bread, nuts and citrus fruits,'' the report said. But in a further refinement of the data, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said nuts appeared to be the major common food that protected against heart disease. `` It was fairly consistent across the sexes, by the age groups, by smokers and nonsmokers, and all of the major risk factors,'' he said. A re-survey of part of the study group determined that peanuts were the most commonly consumed nut _ chosen by about 60 percent of those questioned. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said the questions dealt only with the frequency of nut consumption and found that the more often nuts were eaten, the greater the protection. Those who ate nuts at least once a day did best. As to quantity, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said `` a handful of nuts, or something like that'' was probably typical. <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said it is not now known what in nuts can provide protection from heart attack, but he speculated that it could be the types of vegetable fats. `` They are relatively fatty, as vegetable foods go, but they have much more polyunsaturated fat than most of the fatty foods one would eat,'' he said. Other studies have shown that polyunsaturated fats tend to be less likely to cause coronary disease than saturated fats, the type that is commonly in meats. Co-authors of the <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study were Dr. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabate </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>.

 A bill endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> tries to draw a distinction between careless taxpayers and those who are out to beat the system. Taxpayers also would face less chance of being penalized two or more times for the same mistake, under the measure passed by a voice vote Tuesday. The bill would revamp the system of nearly 150 civil tax penalties that may be imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and is intended to be part of the committee's share of deficit reduction for the budget year that begins Oct. 1. Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the committee's oversight panel and chief author of the overhaul, said public hearings showed `` the current penalty structure is a confusing morass of complex, overlapping penalties that are often unduly harsh or just plain irrational.'' Just 35 years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had only 13 penalties to enforce. The growth is partly due to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' use of penalties to raise revenue, authorities say. In 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> assessed 26 million penalties totaling nearly $ 6 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> supports overhauling the penalty structure. The rewriting is based on the notion that penalties should be used only to encourage compliance, not to raise money. An example of the changes: Present law imposes a 5 percent penalty for underpayment of tax; the bill would raise that generally to 20 percent. Most of the changes involve penalties on banks and other payers that fail to file reports on interest and dividends paid, and on employers that miss the deadline for turning over withheld taxes to the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In most cases, the revised penalties would be graduated so that the longer the delay in paying or filing and the more blatant the mistake, the higher the penalty. For example, the penalty for failing to file an information return with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> _ such as a Form 1099 statement, on which a bank reports interest paid to a depositor _ now is $ 50 for each failure to file. The maximum is $ 100,000 a year. The bill would vary that from $ 15 for a few days' tardiness -LRB- a maximum of $ 75,000 a year -RRB- to $ 50 per failure, to a maximum of $ 250,000.

<HEAD>Industrial Countries Boost Consumption; Drop Reported in Third World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Americans, Japanese and west Europeans have been boosting their consumption and investment in the future during the 1980s but Third World countries have lagged in both, according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The average Japanese, for example, used $ 5,269 worth of goods in 1980 and $ 6,206 in 1987. The average for the 12 countries of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> rose from $ 6,127 to $ 6,922. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> consumption rose to an average $ 8,957 from $ 7,609. Investment rose too _ that is, the building of new factories and machinery that create more production and jobs for the future. Americans on average invested the least of the three, and much of the money was borrowed abroad, but there was an average rise from $ 1,918 to $ 2,373. The European rise was smaller, from $ 2,338 to $ 2,432. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s increase was greater: from $ 2,994 to $ 3,801. No figures are given for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes some percentages, found Soviet consumption growing slowly and even declining a bit between 1985 and 1986. The World Bank figures appeared in the 1988-1989 edition of its `` World Tables,'' a 650-page volume that consists largely of statistics. The bank uses the value of the dollar in 1980 as a measuring stick. The figures show that people in some Third World countries, despite low incomes and mounting debt, generally managed to keep their consumption fairly steady _ though at levels that reflect deep poverty compared with industrial countries. The average consumption in Third World countries rose slightly, from $ 451 in 1980 to $ 483 in 1987. Behind the averages lie wide variations. The value of goods consumed by the average Chinese increased by more than half between 1979 and 1987, but in 1987 they were still worth only $ 217. In <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, the most populous country of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, there was a decline from a peak of $ 821 in 1982 to $ 621 in 1987. Average incomes of people in many poor <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries have been going down since they became independent of European colonial powers during the 1960s and 1970s. Consumption in those African countries rose between 1980 and 1987, but only to an average $ 206 a year from $ 174. There also were declines in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, though not as great on average as in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. An ominous figure was one for low-income Africans, where investment declined from an average of only $ 67 in 1974 to $ 38 in 1987. That means fewer schools, roads, clinics, factories and other installations are being built that could improve living standards and incomes for the next generation.

<HEAD>Once Shy, Haitian Student Becomes Presidential Scholar in the Arts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupiton </PERSON> arrived from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> five years ago, she was painfully shy but determined to become a dancer. This week, she was good enough to perform at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and receive a medallion from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House. `` I always knew I could dance,'' she says. `` I always believed in myself that I could do it.'' Now 18 and shy no longer, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> was selected by a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> commission as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 20 most promising young artists. She and 140 other high school seniors across the country traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as this year's Presidential Scholars for their academic and artistic excellence. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>, who lives with her mother in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, will be graduated next Tuesday from <ORGANIZATION> Julia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, where she took her first dance lessons four years ago in the school's Talent Unlimited arts program. She will enter <ORGANIZATION> Sarah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on a scholarship this fall. Greeting the Presidential Scholars on the White House South Lawn, the president said Tuesday they were `` some of the best and brightest students in American education,'' and had an obligation to help others. `` While already you've done much, I know you will do more _ and not for yourselves alone, but for nation and neighbors,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The definition of a successful life must include serving others. That goes double for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best,'' he told them. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> and her 19 fellow Presidential Scholars in the Arts were chosen from among 5,200 applicants whose achievements were judged by the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> in the Arts at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Finalists were recommended to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> commission for final selections. The 20 top young artists displayed their talents Monday night on the stage of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, one of five days of activities ending today. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>, who specializes in modern dance, performed a solo she choreographed with her high school teacher, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. In a backstage interview before the show, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said that as a freshman in his dance class, `` <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> was so shy she could n't even speak her name'' and would turn away and hide her face. `` But when she danced her first solo, I saw that she had some special spirit, this fire, this spark,'' he said. `` I knew it would come out, so I did n't push her. Although she was very, very shy, she had this incredible desire to learn and excell.'' <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> said dance lessons were too expensive in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, so at age 13 she moved to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> to live with an aunt and study in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. She did n't know a word of English. `` I was feeling like an outcast,'' she said, blaming her shyness on fear of being ostracized because of her Creole accent. But a few months after she began studying with <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, she said, her fear abruptly vanished in her physical exuberance on the dance floor. `` I suddenly burst out,'' she said. `` My body just let go, and he told me it was good. Dancing really helped me to open up, and it became easier to use that freedom to speak.'' At 15, she won favorable notice in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> for a dance recital by her high school troupe at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> theater. She won scholarships to study at the Joffrey Ballet and the <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> School of Contemporary Dance. This summer, she studied on scholarship with the Dance Theater of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> has pursued her dream without apparent support from her mother, who moved to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>'s brother and sister in 1986. `` My family has never seen me dance,'' she said. `` My mother does n't like it because she says you ca n't earn a good living at dancing.'' But <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> is convinced that <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> will prevail because of her natural talent. `` Her growth in the last four years has been phenomenal,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anti-Smoking Group Touts Airline Survey, Tobacco Institute Objects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An anti-smoking group says its survey of 27,000 airline passengers proves the public supports a smoking ban on short flights, but the tobacco industry says the survey is unscientific. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Respiratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> says 51.7 percent of smokers agree that the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less should be made permanent. The support among non-smokers is 91.1 percent, the group said Tuesday. The association announced the results of its survey, conducted by volunteers at 66 airports in 33 cities during the last week of April, at a news conference Tuesday with several <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who support anti-smoking legislation. The airline smoking law will remain in effect until April 1990 unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> makes it permanent. Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, D-Ill., said the association's survey, which shows 84 percent overall approval of the anti-smoking law, is solid evidence of the law's support and effectiveness `` Even most smokers realize this law has helped improve the health and safety of everyone who flies,'' said <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, in a news release, said the poll was inconsistent with other data on the issue. It accused the respiratory care association of conducting unscientific polls that generate `` self-serving, questionable data.'' The institute said professional polls taken when airlines were required to have smoking and nonsmoking areas on all flights showed 87 percent support for that policy. The respiratory association gave no margin of error for its poll, but said it took steps to ensure that poll-takers did not identify themselves as being from an anti-smoking group. It said support for the smoking ban has risen 30 percent since the organization conducted a similar poll in 1987. <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON> said his anti-smoking measure would be attached to the transportation appropriation bill and include two amendments. One would impose a smoking ban on all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights. If it fails, the other would make the two-hour-flight ban permanent. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee plans a hearing Thursday on <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>'s measure and three other bills that would take various steps against smoking on airliners.

 Taxpayers nationwide will foot the bill if a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> utility is granted deductions for its losses on the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> congressman contends. `` Taxpayers from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will suffer because the plant's owner has been granted a $ 2.8 billion tax break,'' Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said Tuesday in denouncing plans to close the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> reactor <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> is pushing legislation to block the estimated $ 2.8 billion writeoff for the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in April approved the tax deduction for losses sustained as a result of scrapping the plant. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>'s measure would change the tax code to bar deductions for losses on the abandonment of a fully licensed nuclear plant. The bill was referred to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where senior <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democratic Reps. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> could be expected to block it. <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist, said Tuesday he takes the challenge seriously but does not think the bill has much chance of passing. `` It would be analogous to a New Yorker introducing legislation to reopen a plant in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after ratepayers had voted to close it,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> added. `` This would be a gross misuse of congressional power.'' Under a plan negotiated by <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> would be sold to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state for a symbolic dollar in exchange for a series of rate hikes. <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON>'s license would be transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which would contract with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to decommission the $ 5.5 billion plant.

<TEXT>
 A narrow subcommittee vote to accept <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s $ 69 billion military purchasing budget shows <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is mindful of budget constraints, says <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. `` Would you have thought that you could have gotten the procurement subcommittee to vote for this?'' a gleeful <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., said Tuesday after the procurement and military nuclear systems subcommittee approved his amendment by a vote of 10-9 <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, who chairs both the subcommittee and the full <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> panel, had urged his colleagues to accept <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s procurement budget as is, to prevent add-ons totaling $ 7.2 billion `` I think it's a remarkable testimony to the fact that people do realize the budget squeeze issue,'' said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. The full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> will vote on the amendment next week. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> declined to give odds on the decision but indicated that the final vote will be close. `` While the budget may not be perfect, it's a darn good product _ especially given the 39 days <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had to put it together,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> told the panel. The chairman and two other Democrats _ <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ joined seven of the panel's eight Republicans in approving the measure. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> was the lone <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member to vote against the plan, which basically removes the right of members to rewrite the $ 300 billion fiscal 1990 budget to restore local projects canceled by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said he was pleased with the vote. But some Democratic members complained that the measure amounted to an abdication of the subcommittee's authority. `` A yes vote ... would be abrogating ourselves out of business,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, D-Ind. `` I think I'm giving up my rights if I have to vote for something that I can only change on the floor,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisisky </PERSON>, D-Va. Some members have pressed for restoring the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> F-14D Tomcat fighter and Marine V-22 Osprey, which <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> canceled. If restored, the F-14D would add $ 366 million and the V-22 $ 700 million. Other possible add-ons include $ 55 million in new equipment for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> P-3 anti-submarine aircraft, $ 436 million for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130s and $ 240 million for heavy trucks made in <LOCATION> Oshkosh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said after the vote that lobbying was fierce on both sides, with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pushing for adoption of the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> budget <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures the B-2 stealth bomber, fears losing funds for its program to support other military projects. Lobbying against the plan were <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, builder of the F-14, and the alumni association of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, backers of the V-22 Osprey.

 Former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has yet to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but already is toying with the idea of a comeback, saying he would consider accepting `` an absolutely genuine draft of a bipartisan nature.'' `` I am not sure that I should consider it even then, but I do very earnestly appreciate it,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat said Tuesday in a statement. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who stepped down as speaker amid an ethics investigation, has said he will resign from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this month but has not said precisely when. He was replaced as speaker on May 31 by Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. Over the weekend, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> reportedly met in his hometown of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> with supporters who urged him to run for reelection to the seat in a move to gain political vindication `` Naturally, I am touched by the warm and gracious spirit of the request, coming as it apparently does from a variety of different sources,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` I have not encouraged it. The only way that I could even consider it at all would be if it were an absolutely genuine draft of a bipartisan nature.'' It is impossible to forecast what the ethics committee might do if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned and then won reelection to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, panel attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Tuesday night. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was investigated over alleged improprieties in a book deal and other matters touching on his personal finances. The ethics panel would be free to reopen the probe that drove <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> from the speaker's chair. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republican Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said there was no way that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> could gain bipartisan support for re-election. `` In my opinion, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that he was going to resign and the people who elected him ... expect him to do that'' and not run again, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. Various <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> politicians have been eyeing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s seat. But he is believed to remain highly popular in his district, where some voters appear to believe he was treated too harshly, and potential candidates have been reluctant to surface until he is out of the picture. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Tuesday he thought <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would be reelected if the former speaker ran again. `` And I think that would demonstrate the strong support that continues to exist in his congressional district, and I think the -LRB- former -RRB- speaker is very proud of that and has a right to be proud,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` It's never bad for the party to have constituents expressing support,'' he added. Another Texas Democrat, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, said that `` the reality is that the -LRB- former -RRB- speaker resigned from the speakership -LRB- and -RRB- has announced that he intends to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He added: `` That's what the speaker has stated in a very emotional way to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and to all of us who have had the privilege of serving with him. Now to find this new scenario is quite a shock but it is very constitutionally possible that this could play.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rattles off his address as `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, 1600,'' but do n't count on finding him there if you visit the nation's capital this summer. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have spent more days away from the White House than in it. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were required to report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on what he did over the summer, it would fill a substantial volume. Between lengthy trips to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been bounding about the country, giving a string of often disjointed speeches and conducting the nation's business on the road. Some critics have questioned whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his multitudinous travels, has been logging useful mileage or merely spinning the adminstration's wheels. In the three weeks since he returned from a four-nation, weeklong trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> centered on a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Made a 4,000-mile, 30-hour round trip to Yellowstone National Park, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Grand Tetons, and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, nominally to tout his environmental programs However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s late-day visit to Yellowstone consisted of a tour of an area damaged by last year's forest fires, and was unrelated to the chief topic of the day _ the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s new clean-air legislation _ Visited a federal law enforcement training center at <LOCATION> Glynco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to talk about his anti-crime package The speech spotlighted a plan whose details had been announced several weeks before. _ Flew by helicopter to the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburbs, where he gave a high school graduation speech and shook hands with all 331 graduates In addition, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to travel today to <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where he was to speak at a motor coach exhibit at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> State Fairgrounds and attend a Republican fund-raiser. On Thursday, he travels to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, both for a fund-raiser and to unveil details of a youth service program. He caps next week with a visit to his family home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> for a five-day Fourth of July holiday, then goes to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the seven-nation economic summit and side visits to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. In August, he plans a 2 -LCB- - week vacation in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> And he's been spending most weeekends not otherwise accounted for at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been doing some business as he moves around the country. He vetoed the minium wage bill aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One as he traveled from <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> last week; in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, he signed a routine message formally transmitting his crime package to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Usually, this would entail nothing more than a quick flourish of the pen and then sending an aide on a 10-minute car ride up from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, 1600, on up to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' he told his law-enforcement audience. `` But when it comes to fighting crime, you deserve more than just business as usual.'' However, even in talking about crime _ a favored subject _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to be sending a mixed message. After a tough speech in which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` let's put the handcuffs on the criminals, not on the criminal justice system,'' he was asked by a <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> rookie for `` some words of wisdom when we enter the field.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` You'll find that you and your colleagues will be severely impacted by the battle against narcotics. Word of wisdom would be: an individual should be treated with respect and given his rights, or her rights, even though the evidence looks overwhelming. ... I think we have to be tolerant.'' The press contingent following <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he hops from city to city has grown increasingly more sparse. For the trip to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> canceled travel arrangements for the regular White House press corps, beyond taking a small `` pool.'' It cited lack of interest among news organizations. `` I'm not going to be a policeman or try to guide your coverage habits. It's as simple as that,'' fumed presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Plan Would Wreck Crime-Fighting Team, Former Leaders Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s plan to place the nation's elite corps of organized crime-fighting prosecutors under control of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys is coming under fire from former leaders of the unit. `` It's impractical, it just wo n't work,'' <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaira </PERSON> said Tuesday at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice. Under <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s plan, prosecutors who are members of the 20-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would no longer report to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division. Instead, they would be controlled by the politically appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys in the cities were they are based. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> says the idea would end turf battles between the strike force and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys. His critics say the elite force, which has chalked up impressive victories in the war against the mob, would soon vanish. `` I guarantee you three years from now it will take the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to find the strike forces,'' said <PERSON> Vaira </PERSON>, a former strike force chief in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phildelphia </LOCATION> who also was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and briefly headed the President's Commission on Organized Crime. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, former head of the strike force in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, was sharply critical of what <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and his aides `` call euphemistically the merger of the strike force. I like to call it the destruction or the abolition of the strike force.'' The plan already has sent strike force attorneys in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hunting for new jobs, he said, adding that the departure of highly experienced prosecutors is likely to grow worse. Lawmakers are considering a move to bar <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> from implementing the plan until Oct. 1 as part of a stopgap spending bill likely to go to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and gain his signature. But the move could go forward after that. Former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> strike force chief <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> testified that strike force attorneys often are paid $ 7,000 to $ 10,000 less than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, even though they usually have more experience. Because of salary adjustments, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s plan would cost $ 100,000 in each city where the strike force is located, <PERSON> O'Sullivan </PERSON> testified. `` You'd be looking at an increase of $ 1 million right off the bat'' nationwide, he said. `` After all these victories, I think it is fair to ask: What is broke that needs fixing?'' said subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, D-N. He said, however, that he would keep an open mind on the issue. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, head of the criminal division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s `` concern for the fight against organized crime is second to none.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` feels strongly enough about this proposal that he is willing to take the heat and the controversy that this proposal stimulates,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. He said the idea of merging the strike forces in each city with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office was one that would promote `` even more harmony'' between the two groups of prosecutors and end `` turf fights.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> took issue with claims that the plan would mean the end of the strike force, saying its members would not be reassigned to work on cases not involving organized crime. He said turf fighting between strike force attorneys and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys offices has at times cut into time that should be spent on fighting mobsters. `` The question is, are we going to spend 30 percent of our time arguing whose case this is, or are we going to make the case?'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Tampon-Labeling Proposal too Confusing, Says Consumer Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A government proposal aimed at helping women minimize the risk of toxic shock syndrome is too confusing, a consumer group says, because it would allow tampon boxes to show two types of absorbency ratings. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s revised plan would require manufacturers to display one of six new standardized absorbency rating terms ranging from low to high. However, they also could continue using traditional designations like regular and super. `` This whole range system is n't as informative and clear as it could be,'' said <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal is an improvement over <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier plan to use an absorbency scale of letters from A to F, `` but there's still potential for confusion to have the old terms appear nearby,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it revised its earlier proposal in response to about 275 comments from consumers, consumer groups and manufacturers, many of whom complained that it was too confusing. The labeling is designed to help women select the lowest absorbency tampon they need to reduce the risk of toxic shock syndrome, which has been associated with tampon use. Toxic shock syndrome is rare, but sometimes fatal. Under the new plan, tampon absorbency would be rated as low, medium, medium-high, high, very high and highest _ according to the number of grams the tampon was designed to absorb. Tampon boxes also would have to carry labels advising women to select the lowest absorbency needed to minimize risk of toxic shock syndrome. Regulations have required this warning since 1982 but allow it to appear on a package insert. Package inserts also must list toxic shock syndrome's symptoms: sudden fever, vomiting, diarrhea, fainting or nearly fainting when standing up, dizziness and a sunburn-like rash. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has been trying since 1981 to convince manufacturers to voluntarily label their products with a standardized absorbency rating so women could compare brand-to-brand. The agency gave up that route in 1984 and began regulatory efforts. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> invited public comments on the new proposal until Aug. 11.

<HEAD>Utility Boosted Security to Stem Potential Nuclear Sabotage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities took extra precautions against potential sabotage by workers at the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power station near <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after city residents voted to close the troubled plant, officials disclosed. The only incident since the June 6 vote was resolved safely, but federal regulators said Tuesday they're keeping a close eye on plant conditions as the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> gradually switches off the reactor with a shrinking work force. `` It's not what you'd call an unsafe situation,'' but the unusual circumstances of the plant shutdown have prompted extra caution, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murley </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s office of reactor regulation The vote marked the first time citizens have decided to close an operating reactor, but analysts say it seems unlikely the move will trigger other closures soon. Still, the shutdown is a blow to an industry already hampered by widespread public concerns about the safety and reliability of nuclear power. Rancho Seco has a spotty record, producing less than 40 percent of the electricity that would have resulted from unfailing year-round operation _ far below the industry average. The utility district had to double its rates over the past four years to pay for plant improvements that cost more than the reactor itself. <PERSON> Murley </PERSON> said plant executives gave him explicit assurances that the shutdown would go smoothly, and he said that so far there was no evidence to the contrary. `` It's a very tough period because all the good people will be looking for other jobs,'' <PERSON> Murley </PERSON> said, adding that there also was a danger of `` bad reactions'' by plant workers to being forced out of the 15-year-old nuclear station. The utility district's senior nuclear executive, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Firlit </PERSON>, has resigned, and about 1,000 regular plant workers were expected to leave by month's end. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for ensuring safety at the nation's 110 nuclear reactors, boosted its usual complement of three resident inspectors at <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> by three or four for several days before and after the election, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a spokesman at the commision's regional office in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said extra security inspectors also were sent to the site to provide around-the-clock surveillance. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has returned to normal levels of supervision at the plant, he said. The utility increased its security at the site but has since trimmed it back, said spokesman <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffner </PERSON>. He said he was not sure of all the reasons for the added protection but that a rush of news reporters to the plant was one. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smeloff </PERSON>, a member of the utility district's board, said in an interview that utility security personnel were added as a general precaution against possible worker backlash and because of a a specific incident with one disgruntled employee. An offduty reactor operator, angered at the prospect of losing his job, telephoned the plant the day after the election to say `` he would not shut it down if so ordered,'' said <PERSON> Smeloff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Heffner </PERSON> said the incident did not constitute a threat to security, but the worker's access to the plant was suspended. He said no decision has been made on possible disciplinary action against the man, whose name was not disclosed. Dean Kunihiro, an official at the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> office, said that while `` it's kind of business as usual'' again at <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION>, the commission is still watchful because a serious accident involving radioactive release is still possible even though the reactor is no longer sustaining a chain reaction. The plant owner is planning to remove the fuel rods from the reactor vessel in August but has not yet decided whether it will continue with the lengthy process of dismantling the plant or try to sell it to another potential operator.

 A Chinese government-sponsored art show was launched for year-long showings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on schedule and without incident _ but also without official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> representation. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>, a 14-year-old prodigy who has made 10,000 brush-and-ink paintings since she was 3 years old, was the undisputed star at the preview of her exhibition of 69 colorful pictures. In a demonstration lasting barely an hour, she created a 70th painting, dashing barefoot, brush in hand, from end to end of a 3-by 6-foot parchment laid on a floor. Her works show monkeys, birds and other beasts displaying human emotions and expressions while cavorting through exquisitely drawn foliage and mountains of <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s rugged native <LOCATION> Guangxi </LOCATION> province, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, far from the turmoil of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> is listed as sponsor of the exhibition but no one from the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> appeared at Tuesday's event, `` maybe because they were too busy,'' said <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insitution </ORGANIZATION>'s Sackler Gallery for Asian art At the very hour of the preview, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members critical of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s violent crackdown against the pro-democracy movement rallied at the nearby <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol grounds, then went to the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to protest killings, violence and arrests in what they described as a confrontational meeting with Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>. The day after demonstrators were shot down in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> suspended official scientific exchanges with the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in protest. But no moves have been reported to suspend cultural exchanges. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s works have been shown in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exhibition was first proposed four years ago, said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Nelson-Atkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, which took the lead in organizing it. It is scheduled to move there Dec. 16 and on to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Asian Art Museum next March. Pictures for the exhibit were sent here months ago and there was no thought of changing plans, only hope that <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> would appear, <PERSON> Sackler </PERSON> officials said. She flew here with her father via <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last weekend and plans to return next week, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliss </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-supported gallery. `` We see this is a cultural event, and apparently not a problem,'' she said. The exhibition's official catalog, however, treats <PERSON> Yani </PERSON> as a symbol of the liberalization in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that is now under threat. It says the Cultural Revolution during the last decade of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Zedong </PERSON>'s rule `` ruthlessly suppressed many of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s greatest artists and artistic traditions in the name of revolutionary culture. `` Public recognition and appreciation of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yani </PERSON>'s remarkable talent may only have been possible because of the gradual loosening of government controls over art that followed <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s death,'' it adds. `` The paintings of a child who knew nothing of politics offered a fresh vision that many artists sought in their own work.'' This is reflected in the title of the exhibition, `` Yani: the Brush of Innocence.''

<HEAD>DC-Virgin Islands Project Violated City Law, Draft Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> government office violated city purchasing laws in a joint personnel project with the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government, according to a draft report on a probe into the project. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today the preliminary report showed that the Office of Personnel project cost the city at least $ 258,645, or nearly twice as much as the $ 144,786 in reimbursement now being sought by the city. `` It appears to the committee that this project was a rogue operation that operated outside the normal lines of authority and outside the safeguards'' for the expenditure of public funds, said the draft report on the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation. A federal grand jury is investigating the project in which the district helped revamp the island government's personnel system and draft new laws. Virgin Islands Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> and District Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> conceived the project which was jointly supervised by former district Personnel Director <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> Sr. and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former aide to <LOCATION> Farrelly </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> later was convicted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Inspector <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> has said some <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> officials used the project as an excuse to party in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> at public expense. The draft report said <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> failed to get a written agreement from the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government covering the project's activities, and that costs were allowed to escalate despite indications of `` serious administrative and financial problems. The report cited testimony by <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, chief of budget and financial management for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION>, that he was ordered by a superior to ignore purchasing requirements in hiring two consultants.

 The battle over President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> as ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> moves to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after a favorable committee vote reflecting sharp disagreement on whether he lied about playing a role in the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> has repeatedly denied under oath that he was involved in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret operation to resupply the Nicaraguan Contra rebels while serving as national security adviser to then-Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., who spearheaded the lengthy probe by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority into <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s alleged links to the operation, said he had not decided how hard to press the matter on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor But <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s nomination appeared to have been given a solid boost by the decision of three committee Democrats to join nine Republicans in recommending approval. The committee voted 12-7 on Tuesday to send the nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is not likely to act before it returns from its Independence Day recess on July 10. Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., who at one point organized a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> boycott of a panel meeting in order to force action on <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s nomination, called the panel's decision `` a very big victory,'' particularly because of <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s `` very large expenditure of energy and political capital `` Picking up three Democrats is very helpful'' in assuring <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s eventual confirmation,'' <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> said. Earlier <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> told the committee: `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is loyal, but he is not foolish. If he had determined that <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was not truthful he would not have submitted this nomination.'' Democrats voting to recommend confirmation of <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> were Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, D-R.I. and Sens. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In explaining his vote, <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> said he `` concluded that Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and the president should be given the benefit of the doubt'' despite the `` excellent arguments'' made by <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> said he closely examined the evidence and found <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s explanations to be `` as reasonable and believable as I think we could expect under the circumstances. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> is a retired career veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who served as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said he voted against the nomination not because he believed <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> lacked credibility but because he is concerned that his <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> background will make him a political target in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Addressing the committee moments before the vote, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said the nomination should be rejected `` on the grounds of both credibility and judgment.'' `` We are being asked to reward a man many of us do not believe has been straight with us while under oath,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` We are being asked to promote a man to a crucial diplomatic post whose judgment _ by his own admission _ has been so flawed that he twice offered to resign from then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> denied he was making a purely partisan effort to harm <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> and some other Republicans have charged. He said he remains highly skeptical that <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was never told by his close friend and former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> colleague <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was recruited by <PERSON> North </PERSON> to help resupply the Contras with military aid at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had forbidden such activities. During two separate appearances before the committee, both times under oath, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he was unaware that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was doing anything more than helping the government of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> put down the left-wing insurgency against it, the mission for which he was sent to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> made clear he does not believe <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s story that although <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told him some of the details of the Contra resupply mission in August 1986, he did not put the pieces together until the following December. `` Our hearings revealed documents making clear that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> North </PERSON> were working together in an illegal Contra resupply scheme months earlier, from January 1985 _ the same week <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` I recognize how difficult it is for some senators to state the conclusion most of us share: Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> has not been straight with us,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` The implications for Mr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> _ and for the president _ are not pleasant.'' The panel also postponed action on three other nominations after Democrats complained that the nominees' only visible qualifications were large <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contributions. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., initiated the delay when he complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors should have at least some qualifications The three include:

 An irate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> refused to answer questions after the actor accused his former lover's lawyer of insulting him and his 6-year-old son during a courtroom shouting match. After the exchange, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> testified that the 39-year-old Oscar-winning actor introduced her to several people as his wife; Hurt testified Monday and Tuesday that he never did so. Ms. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, trying to prove that their three-year relationship constituted a common-law marriage, is suing for half of what Hurt earned during the time they lived together. The trial was scheduled to resume this afternoon. The confrontation Tuesday arose while plaintiff attorney <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> questioned Hurt about his relationship with <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, the mother of the actor's son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, exasperated by <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s answers and by frequent objections by defense lawyer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, complained to state Justice <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> that <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> was `` interrupting my rhythm, and rhythm is everything.'' As <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> tried to resume questioning after a spate of <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>'s objections, Hurt _ who had been combative and evasive in 1 -LCB- days of testimony, quipped to the lawyer, `` Get your rhythm right. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> replied: `` You had yours right, pal, when you had <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, did n't you?'' Hurt asked the judge, `` You can permit that?'' The judge, hearing the case without a jury, said, `` Objection sustained!'' and told <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> to stick to the issues. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> tried to resume questioning. `` I'm blocked,'' Hurt told the lawyer. `` What you just said is an insult to me, you understand? OK? I ca n't hear anything else!'' The judge ordered a 10-minute recess. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a 32-year-old former ballerina, testified that Hurt introduced her as his wife to people they met in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where he was shooting `` The Big Chill'' in late 1982. She specifically mentioned a real estate agent, <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheidt </PERSON>, who was helping them find a place to live. `` He introduced me as his wife to a few people,'' she said. `` He called me his wife on the phone but I do n't know to whom.'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> also said that Hurt discussed marrying her in a double wedding with `` Big Chill'' co-star <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilly </PERSON> and her fiancee, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>. She said the idea was Hurt's. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> testified that Hurt wanted to get married after they signed a prenuptial agreement. Later, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> accused Hurt of committing perjury. `` He lied. In court, on the stand, under oath, the man lied,'' she said. `` He said he did not sign a prenuptial agreement with me. He did. We both did.'' Hurt, who in March married <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, daughter of bandleader <PERSON> Skitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, testified Monday that he failed to get <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> to agree in writing that she would never make any claims on his money. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said she refused to sign a later agreement because Hurt had refused to set up a trust fund for their son. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said that under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> statutes, a common-law marriage exists between them. She based her claim on the period between Dec. 9, 1982, when Hurt learned his divorce from actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> was final after seven years of marriage, and Jan. 10, 1983, when they left the state. Hurt, who also starred in `` Body Heat,'' `` Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' `` Broadcast News,'' `` Gorky Park,'' and `` The Accidental Tourist,'' stayed in court during <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' testimony but avoided looking at her most of the time.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Triggerman in Mexican Journalist's Murder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal police have arrested a former national security agent and onetime movie actor on suspicion he was the triggerman in the 1984 murder of leading newspaper columnist <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>, authorities said. The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> City Attorney General's Office identified the suspect as <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON>, 36, a member of a prominent family of politicians from the neighboring state of <LOCATION> Puebla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, former director of a now-dissolved equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested June 13 in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for allegedly masterminding the murder and is awaiting trial on charges of homicide. <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>, whose front-page column in the newspaper Excelsior exposed wrongdoing in high places, was shot to death on May 30, 1984, at the entrance of a parking garage after leaving his office. The Attorney General's Office says it has evidence <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON>, 47, ordered the killing of <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>, whom he had known for 15 years, when he learned the columnist planned to expose his links to prominent drug traffickers. The office said <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday and booked `` on suspicion of being one of the material authors'' in the slaying of <LOCATION> Buendia </LOCATION>. A police source, who insisted on anonymity, said authorities had evidence indicating <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> was the `` triggerman.'' Under Mexican law, <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> must be arraigned within 24 hours or the case will be thrown out for lack of evidence. The attorney general's office said <PERSON> Mora </PERSON>, when questioned by a city prosecutor, denied he had anything to do with the shooting, saying: `` When I arrived he -LRB- <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> -RRB- was already dead.'' The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> identified <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> as the grandson of former <LOCATION> Puebla </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Maximino </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, a onetime Secretary of Communications and Transportation. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> was also a grandnephew of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, who was president of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from 1940 to 1946. A 1973 graduate from the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> worked for various law enforcement agencies before joinging the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 as a member of an `` elite'' group of 20 special agents, the Attorney General's office said in its statement. <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> had been a member of a rock group and played bit parts as an actor in at least four horror and crime movies. He is still a member <ORGANIZATION> ANDA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> was director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 until the government dissolved it in 1985 because of widespread corruption. The Attorney General's office said in a statement Tuesday that it had evidence that <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> received millions of dollars a month in bribes from drug baron <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> to allow the smuggling of large quantities of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> is awaiting trial for the 1985 torture-slaying of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> and his Mexican pilot <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. The attorney general's office said <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> also had links to <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, reputedly the country's top drug trafficker, who was arrested earlier this year. <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON>, who was first on the scene minutes after <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> was shot, conducted the preliminary investigation in the case. He has also been indicted on charges of obstructing justice and abuse of authority.

<HEAD>Warner Lawyers Say Time Buyout Violates FCC Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> says <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s multibillion-dollar attempt to buy <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> violates the 1984 Cable Act and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rules But lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, which launched a $ 10.7 billion hostile tender offer for Time after <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> announced a proposed $ 18 billion merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday it should set aside its previous ruling allowing Time to transfer control of its cable TV systems to <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount said Time had misrepresented to its stockholders the nature of the transfer and that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> had written to state attorneys general asking them to oppose <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal without notifying Paramount of the letters. These actions raise `` questions about Time's character qualifications,'' <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said, asking the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to set aside its approval of the license transfers pending an investigation. The filings were the latest round of high-stakes corporate manuevering in which the three parties are trying to create the world's largest entertainment and media conglomerate. After the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger was announced in March, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> weighed in with its hostile takeover offer. But Time fired back Friday with a $ 12.6 billion offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Besides the tussle over transfer of cable licenses, the battle is expected to be waged in court in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where all three companies are incorporated. Paramount earlier this month asked the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> for permission to give control of Time to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> pending <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and licenses held by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s 82-percent-owned subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s request `` would violate the recent Cable Act because <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> has n't gotten consent from any of these cities for the <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, echoing assertions Time made against <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> in a June 13 <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> filing, said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s plan would `` undermine the delicate balance'' established in the 1984 Cable Act for regulation of cable systems by local authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> late Monday to deny the application made by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> KDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for expedited consent to transfer control of Time to <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> and then to Paramount. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s plan called for an `` unprecedented extension'' to the cable TV industry of <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> rules that cover hostile tender offers for broadcast licenses. It said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> can allow transfer of a broadcaster even before it decides the receiving party is qualified to hold broadcast licenses, but cable franchises must be transferred by local authorities and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has no say.

<HEAD>Technician Dies From Monkey Virus; 21 Co-Workers at Risk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A technician who apparently contracted a rare form of herpes from a laboratory monkey's bite has died, and 21 co-workers are at significant risk of infection, officials say. The technician, whose name was withheld, was infected with herpes B virus, also known as monkey herpes. It attacks the brain and nervous system and kills more than 70 percent of people who catch it, scientists say. The 23-year-old victim, an employee of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mattawan </LOCATION>, about 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, died Tuesday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Bronson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. Authorities have tested 110 people who worked at the lab or had contact with the victim, said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. He said 21 employees have significant risk of catching the disease because monkeys have bitten or scratched them. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a spokesman for the company, said the bite was not immediately reported. `` We are deeply saddened by the loss of an employee from the extremely rare B virus and are further saddened that this unreported incident did not allow preventive measures to be taken that could have spared his life,'' he said. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said guidelines for handling such bites and scratches are established by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The disease is common among Old World monkeys, which can spread it through bites or scratches when it is in the active phase. Test results are pending on the 21 people, who will require retesting in three to four weeks because of the disease's incubation period, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. There have been 30 cases of monkey herpes among humans reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1932, said Hall. Only one of those cases was spread by human-to-human contact.

 The key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> made up earlier losses to close higher today while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar surged against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 111.81 points, or 0.34 percent, finishing at 33,345.28 after reversing a downward trend earlier in the day. It was a 220.29-point winner Tuesday. The dollar ended trading at 144.95 yen, up 1.15 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.80 yen. It opened at 144.85 yen and traded between 144.73 yen and 144.03 yen. Traders said the dollar's strength was based on overnight gains in overseas markets. `` Investors still want to invest in dollar assets, but the dollar's value fell so suddenly last week that they are not buying aggressively,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese city bank, who spoke anonymously. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fluctuated wildly last week, closing at 151.30 yen last Thursday and then plummeting 6.25 yen on Friday to close at 145.05 yen. On the stock exchange, brokers said the index began to rise when trust investment companies conducted arbitrage deals between the spot and the futures markets. Bargain hunting in the first section also pushed prices higher, they said.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, eight months ago a congressman and one day ago a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hopeful, now stands convicted of lying to a grand jury investigating a drug-related money laundering sting. `` Obviously, I'm very disappointed,'' said the 38-year-old conservative Republican, who lost re-election in November following his perjury indictment. He was convicted Tuesday of all nine counts and faces a possible 10 months to five years in prison and $ 250,000 fine on each count. Sentencing was scheduled for Aug. 25. Probation is not an option under new federal sentencing guidelines, which <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> supported as a congressman. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who spent two terms representing <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs, had hoped for an acquittal and a 1990 race against Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga. Now, barring a victory on appeal, he will go to prison after his Aug. 25 sentencing <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> sat impassively in the federal courtroom as the jury announced its verdict on the 22nd day of his trial. His wife, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, rested her hand on his back. `` I could have understood one or two counts, but I just do n't understand this,'' he told companions as he headed to a probation office Later, he told reporters he would appeal. `` This process is not over,'' he said. `` We'll be trying this case again, and, I hope, not in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorneys asked before and during the trial for his case to be moved because of pretrial publicity. He said he `` had gotten involved in something I never should have gotten involved in, but I've said I had been 100 percent truthful before the grand jury. That has n't changed.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who went to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, was defeated in November by Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a former TV actor in `` The Dukes of Hazzard,'' while under the cloud of the perjury indictment. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was accused of lying to a federal grand jury in his Feb. 2, 1988, testimony concerning his month-long 1987 negotiations with an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent and with a <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> supporter later convicted of money laundering. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent was posing as a drug-money launderer. The government said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was seeking $ 850,000 to complete construction on his luxurious suburban home; the money was to be funneled to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> through a mortgage company created by his friend and political supporter, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, authorities said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> had been accused of 10 counts that said he made 20 false statements to the grand jury. The judge dropped one count, and the jurors Tuesday found 18 to be willful lies. Specifically, they found that he lied when he said he did n't recall being told the money included narcotics dollars, when he said he never agreed to accept the money and when he said a $ 150,000 check he received _ but later returned _ had nothing to do with the deal `` To me, this is among the most important, if not the most important, case we've handled,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. He noted that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, as a congressman, not only swore to uphold the laws, but helped make them. `` Even people at that high level of public life must be held accountable for their misdeeds,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, a lawyer, said the trial included at least two `` very reversible errors'' which he hopes will win him a new trial: <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s dismissal of the testimony of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members have an overwhelming workload, and a prosecutor's remark concerning the possible motivation of defendants to testify during criminal <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> did not testify in his own defense. Neither area, however, directly addressed the bulk of the case: hours of secretly tape-recorded conversations between <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>. In those tapes, heard by the jury, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was told the money he was seeking `` certainly'' included drug money, was told he would be part of an operation to `` wash'' cash, and proposed that a mortgage company be set up as a `` buffer'' to funnel him the money. The deal eventually collapsed. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> said he is `` considering a number of different career options. One of those I've got to put into the blend is a prison ministry. `` I will go where God sends me. ... God does n't make mistakes.'' The lanky, boyish-looking <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> won his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat in a 1984 upset. In his two terms, he staunchly voted with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> right.

<HEAD>Exports Rise Slightly in May Despite Protests</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today said exports rose slightly in May while imports soared, a situation reflecting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s recent economic and political turmoil. According to customs authorities, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> exported $ 4.43 billion of goods in May, up 0.8 percent over the same month in 1988. Imports were up 21.1 percent to $ 5.31 billion in the same period, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The customs figures showed exports for the first five months of the year were up 4.7 percent to $ 18 billion, while imports jumped 24.4 percent to $ 22.67 billion _ a trade imbalance of $ 4.6 billion that was $ 3.8 billion more than the first five months of 1988. The report did not cite reasons for the worsening trade situation. However, the nation is suffering from increasingly serious shortages of raw materials and energy and has had to divert some important export items, such as coal and oil, to the domestic market while importing more raw materials for its processing industries. Politically, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was hit in May by the pro-democracy student demonstrations that disrupted some factory production and distracted the national leadership. The trade situation is expected to worsen in June, when the military killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, triggering unrest throughout the nation.

Despite a no-strike clause in their pact, 28,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members have walked off the job in sympathy with striking <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. As Tuesday wound down, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dials </PERSON> returned to their homes 15 miles away in Man _ <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> to his tan, wooden home on <LOCATION> Burgess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>; Dials to the big white house just around the corner on Main Street. They got together later at <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s house to talk about the day. `` I have no idea when I'll be back at work,'' Dials said. `` I'd be tickled to death to go back to work I want to work.'' Each day, the 40-year-old Dials has driven to the top of <LOCATION> Kelly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and, each day, a half-dozen union pickets with bandannas covering their faces tell him to turn back. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 48, said he has had no trouble with the strikers after telling them he is a supervisor. Beyond that, he has been instructed not to talk. `` I ca n't even tell you my name is <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>,'' he said in the quiet office of the <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> mine. At <LOCATION> Accoville </LOCATION>, where he grew up with <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, Dials looks exasperated when he leans on <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON>'s shining lunch counter. `` I see the ayatollah released our three men down in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> today,'' Dials said, referring to a federal judge. `` I was tickled to death about it. I thought they were going to let me go back to work.'' The three union leaders in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were jailed after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> found them guilty of contempt of court for violating his ban on attempts to block coal trucks at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s processing plants in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> They were freed by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> after promising during a private hearing Tuesday to abide by his order.

There's been little sympathy for <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> since 1972 when a 200-foot-high <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> coal refuse dam broke, wiping the sides of the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> black and taking 125 people to their deaths `` <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> did n't show no sympathy when they killed 125 people here,'' Dials said. `` I'd like to see them run out of the hollow.'' The state sued <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, which settled out of court for $ 1 million. `` I do n't think they'll ever have a friend in this hollow again,'' Dials said.

<HEAD>170 Arrested at Stonehenge in Summer Solstice Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMESBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police today arrested at least 170 hippies who they said tried to enter the grounds of the 4,000-year-old Stonehenge monument before dawn to celebrate the summer solstice. Six people managed to scale a fence on the perimeter of the famed archaeological site before they were detained, and one of them shouted to reporters, `` Free the stones! Free the people!'' <LOCATION> Wiltshire </LOCATION> police said they had warned about 300 people gathered on a highway near the monument to disperse or face arrest for breaking a ban on processions within a 4-mile radius of Stonehenge. The police, numbering about 800, later moved in on the crowd, making arrests on the highway and in and around <LOCATION> Amesbury </LOCATION>, a village 2 miles from Stonehenge. Stonehenge is a mysterious double circle of gigantic standing stones set in <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plain </LOCATION> about 80 miles southwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It is thought to have been a center for pre-Christian and astronomical worship, because the sun rises over a particular stone. Most arrests were made for breaches of the Public Order Act banning processions within the exclusion zone, police said. Violators faced a maximum three-month prison sentence. Police denied access to modern-day druid sun worshipers who in previous years have celebrated the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, with a ritual sunrise ceremony at Stonehenge. About a dozen youths who evaded roadblocks and tried to reach the site under cover of darkness were arrested as they crossed fields. Police closed all roads to the public and dozens of officers protected by visors patrolled on horses. `` Our aim was to avoid confrontation and violence and we have achieved that,'' said <LOCATION> Wiltshire </LOCATION> deputy police Superintendent <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>. `` Our second aim was to make sure an illegal festival was not established and that also has been achieved. The run-up to the solstice was very quiet this year.'' About 2,000 of the hippies gathered for a music festival on specially allocated farmland in <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION>, 40 miles away. In the past, the hippies have held loosely organized music festivals at Stonehenge coinciding with the solstice, when the sun reaches its greatest distance from the equator. The festivals, held since the early 1970's, have been banned since 1985 because of complaints of drug-taking and property damage.

<TEXT>
 A black man who insisted he was unjustly convicted by an all-white jury was executed in the gas chamber early today for a five-day robbery spree in which three people were slain. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, appeared to gasp for breath and shrug his shoulders several times as the cyanide gas swirled around him. He was declared dead at 12:15 a.m., minutes after being strapped into a chair in the gas chamber. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was the fourth person executed at the state penitentiary at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> and the 113th in the nation since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the death penalty in 1976. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was executed for the June 14, 1980, shooting death of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> convenience store clerk <PERSON> Linzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. The robbery netted $ 111 and came during a spree in Hinds and <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> counties in which two other people were killed and two were wounded. Also participating in the spree was <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who escaped with <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. White is serving two life terms after pleading guilty to murder in the death of <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and a bar owner. Defense attorneys protested that prosecutors deliberately excluded blacks from the jury, denying <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> a fair trial. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted 7-2 against a stay, and Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' plea for clemency. `` I will not stand in the way of the courts' justice. ... <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> is a mass murderer who killed in cold blood,'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. `` He tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the courts, and discrimination had no bearing in his case. ... `` <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' sentence is a result of his own crime, and his fate now rests in God's hands,'' the governor said. But in a newspaper interview published Tuesday, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> maintained his innocence and insisted he did not receive a fair trial, even though four different appeals courts rejected arguments that prosecutors deliberately excluded blacks from the jury. `` You know how I felt when I saw -LRB- the all-white -RRB- jury?'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I said, ` I'm dead.'''

<HEAD>Dieter Sheds 173 Pounds, Donates Excess Skin to Burn Victims</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CX3</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 3-month-old boy with severe burns was the first beneficiary of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Genz </PERSON>'s decision to donate 4 square feet of his excess skin to a hospital burn unit. Genz' diet recently allowed him to shed 170 pounds, but left him with a large flap of skin on his abdomen, which was removed surgically Monday. `` There have been rare cases where parents have donated skin for their children,'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Perls </PERSON>, education director for the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` But none of us have ever heard of a case like this.'' The 5-foot-11 Genz weighed 430 pounds last August when he began a high-protein weight-loss regimen. Last week, he weighed in at 260. He said the operation removed 19 -LCB- pounds of skin and adjoining tissue. Some of the skin went to <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a 3-month-old victim of a fire in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. When the infant was admitted, he was suffering from smoke inhalation and burns to his face, head and arms. It was a life-threatening situation, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Now, said <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, `` he's doing well.'' More lives are saved by skin transplants than any other donated organ, said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, professor of surgery and director of the hospital's burn unit. Most donated skin comes from cadavers, Ms. <PERSON> Perls </PERSON> said. Donated skin `` is used as a kind of living bandage'' while the patient regenerates his own skin, Ms. <PERSON> Perls </PERSON> said. Then the borrowed tissue is shed. Because its use is temporary, skin used for burn patients need not be a perfect match like that used for skin grafts or other organ transplants, Ms. <PERSON> Perls </PERSON> said. Genz, a 43-year-old equipment coordinator for the emergency department at <ORGANIZATION> Sherman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Elgin </LOCATION>, said the idea for donating the skin came while he was eating lunch with some nurses. `` We were joking that it was too bad I could n't donate the skin,'' he said. `` Then one of the nurses said, ` Why not?''' he recalled Tuesday from his hospital bed, where he was recovering from Monday's surgery. The decision `` left me with a good feeling,'' <PERSON> Genz </PERSON> said, adding he was feeling fine despite `` kind of a big scar.''

 <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> <PERSON> Brace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON>, trying to keep its head above $ 2.6 billion in debt, has gone fishing for a new owner for <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON> the killer whale and its Sea World theme parks. The Orlando-based publishing and entertainment giant also put up for sale two other central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> attractions, <ORGANIZATION> Boardwalk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Baseball and <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION>, plus all land holdings. Estimates of the worth of the package ranged from $ 1.5 billion to $ 2.5 billion. `` We know most every employee in the parks,'' <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>'s longtime chairman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovanovich </PERSON>, told reporters Tuesday. `` And it hurts a little bit to think that you're going to say goodbye to part of your family. But we're not going to do it unless it's done rightly.'' Financial analysts say the sale of the parks will help beef up a balance sheet weakened by huge debts acquired to repel an unfriendly takeover attempt by British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. To counter <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s unsolicited bid of $ 2 billion in May 1987, <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> adopted a takeover defense that weighed it down with in debt. `` HBJ is about $ 2.6 billion in debt and has a deficit of $ 1.5 billion in stockholder equity ... so this is a positive development for the company,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> was the second-most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday following the morning announcement with 3.75 million shares changing hands. The stock rose $ 3.75 to close Tuesday at $ 13.875. During the past two years, <PERSON> Harcourt </PERSON> has disposed of trade-magazine and school-supply interests, streamlined its theme parks division and reshuffled its publishing operations _ all of which included huge reductions in personnel. But that was n't enough, according to some analysts who had foreseen the sale of an entire operating division as the only way to pay off the debt. `` The first love of this company is publishing,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bramwell </PERSON> of the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Gabelli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They should n't have been doing all these -LRB- other -RRB- things.'' The marine parks are in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON> is the stage name given to the performing whales at the parks. The land for sale is about 1,000 acres in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> HBJ </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest textbook publisher, lost $ 126.5 million, or $ 2.04 a share, last year compared with a 1987 profit of $ 64.4 million, or $ 1.34 a share.

The date has popularly been listed by calendar makers as the official start of summer, although that title carries no official weight. For example, meteorologists consider that summer began June 1.

<HEAD>Statewide High School Tests Canceled After Newspaper Publishes Answers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state is looking for ways to keep its high school achievement tests under wraps after it was forced to cancel an exam when the answers were published in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper, saying it was showing that illicitly obtained tests were widely available, published the answer sheet to a chemistry test Tuesday, the day it was to be given to an estimated 80,000 students across the state. Officials probing the theft of the test results have found the exams were widely available to students in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said Education Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON>. Tests in biology, math, French and global studies also were reported to be available, he said. `` We are considering several measures which will improve our security in the future,'' <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said the office was investigating reports the tests and results were being sold for $ 2,000, although some tests were available for as little as $ 5 or $ 10 the night before the exam. The regents tests, given in 17 subjects over a one-week period in late June, are taken by high school students and generally account for a portion of a students' grade. After the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> published the chemistry answers, they were quickly distributed through copy and fax machines across the state, forcing only the second cancelation in the test's history. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said it took a reporter 15 minutes to find a copy of a test after he was assigned to check reports they were stolen. He said the test results were published on the front page as a service to students who were planning to take the exam legitimately when there was so much cheating going on. `` Their inability to recognize the ingenuity of teen-agers, coupled with the proliferation of photocopiers and fax machines, was silly,'' <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> said the department believed it could contain the damage to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and that the tests could have been given elsewhere in the state on Tuesday. But several hours after the newspaper was published, it became clear this was impossible, he said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is considering suing the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> for the cost of preparing and giving a replacement test, said <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> She estimated those costs at $ 250,000. `` If they want to sue us, fine,'' <PERSON> Nachman </PERSON> said. `` I think the discovery will be very revealing to us and all our colleagues in the press.'' In <LOCATION> Plattsburgh </LOCATION>, near the Canadian border, <ORGANIZATION> Plattsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> junior <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said she was relieved, but the cancellation left a nagging doubt. `` In a way, I'm curious what I would have gotten on the regents ... in a way I'm kind of disappointed,'' she said.

 Authorities detained <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s main opposition leader, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, while she was laying wreaths today to honor demonstrators killed a year ago by the military, official sources said. She and the 15 followers rounded up with her were released after an hour-long interrogation, said the sources, who asked for anonymity. Witnesses said <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and the others were taken away in open military trucks to a government office near where the ceremony took place. No official statement has been made about the incident at <LOCATION> Myeinigon </LOCATION>, four miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, the daughter of deceased national hero Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, held a religious ceremony with her followers at a branch office of her National League for Democracy and then walked to the spot where several demonstrators were shot by police last June 21. Several hundred people were present at the wreath-laying when authorities moved in. In recent months, <LOCATION> Aung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kyi </LOCATION> has been harassed on occasion but generally been given considerable leeway by the military government to campaign throughout the country. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, a charismatic, 44-year-old political neophyte, is widely regarded as the most powerful opposition figure in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and her party appears to have the biggest backing among the 200-odd parties that have mushroomed. She returned to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, her home for many years, to look after her ailing mother in April 1988, and became embroiled in the political turmoil sweeping <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. She became one of the main leaders of a pro-democracy uprising that seemed on the verge of toppling 26 years of authoritarian rule through massive street demonstrations. But last September, Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and a group of military officers brutally crushed the student-led protests and clamped martial law on the country. The new leaders allowed the formation of opposition political parties and have promised free general elections next year. But opponents like <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> have remained skeptical about the balloting. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> joined with two popular leaders, retired Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and onetime Defense Minister Tin Oo to form the league of which she is general secretary and Tin Oo president. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> later left the group, claiming the league was being infiltrated by communists.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> today returned the remains of what it says are 28 American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, and is ready to repatriate 16 others, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said. A 21-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team, headed by Lt. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spurgeon </PERSON>, received the remains in a ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s international airport, said Maj. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trout </PERSON>, who accompanied the mission Trout said it was learned that 16 others remains would be turned over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but no date has been set. Today's repatriation was the 10th since August 1987, when a senior delegation to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> obtained promises from the Vietnamese to step up efforts to resolve the issue of the missing in action, or MIAs. Trout said the remains were delivered in wooden boxes, inspected by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forensic expert and then transferred into aluminum caskets. An honor guard saluted as an American flag was placed atop each each casket before being loaded into a C-141 transport aircraft. The aircraft, which flew into <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> earlier today, was scheduled to make a refueling stop on <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> before flying on to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for identification at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military laboratory. With today's turn-over, 212 remains will have been returned since August, 1987, with 56 identified to date as those of American servicemen. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has also allowed joint U.S.-Vietnamese search teams to investigate MIA cases in the Vietnamese countryside. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says 2,353 Americans are still listed MIA from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war, including 1,719 in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, 545 in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, 83 in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and six in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Some Americans believe <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is also holding live Americans but <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has repeatedly denied this.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Traffic jams started at dawn today in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as commuters contended with one-day strikes by rail, bus and subway workers over pay and working conditions. `` By 6 a.m. the traffic buildup was what it is usually like at 8 a.m.,'' said a <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard spokesman. Many city parking lots were full by 6:30 a.m. Perhaps because of the early start, the <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported, the usual jams on the six-lane M25 motorway that circles the city were no worse than usual. The strike by 75,000 railroad workers was the first national rail strike since 1982. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> had the worst problems because of a strike called Tuesday night by 18,500 bus workers to coincide with the strike by the capital's 10,500 subway workers. The subway strike was the seventh unofficial 24-hour walkout in 11 weeks in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s red double-decker buses and sprawling subway network carry more than 3 million passengers daily, while <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> carries 2 million passengers a day. `` I saw a car with three bikes on the roof, two in the back, and five people in the car. I guess they just drive as far as they can and get on their bikes,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilligan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bicycle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> hired buses and organized pickup points to get their employees to work Some companies hired taxis or booked hotel rooms in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` The chances of getting a hotel room near the -LRB- financial district -RRB- now are very, very slim,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UK </ORGANIZATION>, a hotel booking agency. The Royal Mail warned of delays in first - and second-class mail, and all time off for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police was suspended The Independent, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> daily, ran a front-page cartoon today showing a man holding a briefcase and addressing his tearful family: `` I'm just going to work _ I may be gone some time.'' At <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> chartered 27 buses to help make up for the lack of rail service, which normally carries about 24,000 airline passengers and employees daily. No serious traffic congestion was reported <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, where subway service was not affected Police in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> reported no unusual problems. In Parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> condemned the strikers for `` a typically selfish policy to put themselves first ... deliberately causing massive inconvenience to those who have to work.'' Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> refused a request by British Rail to block the planned walkout. Union members voted 29,675 to 20,704 to strike over <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed 7 percent wage increase and plans to abolish national wage bargaining. British Rail, which says the strike will cost it $ 15.5 million, offered to return to the negotiating table and urged staff to ignore the strike call. When subway workers decided Tuesday to go ahead with their stoppage over pay and work conditions, delegates representing bus workers in the Transport and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> decided on a 24-hour strike to demand a 14 percent pay rise. They rejected an offer of 8 percent to 9 percent, which <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buses </ORGANIZATION> said was `` roughly in line with inflation,'' now 8.3 percent annually. The company said a bus driver operating without a conductor earns $ 340 a week. The dispute between <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground and workers on the 248-station subway involves trains now operated only by drivers. Drivers want a $ 99 weekly increase to operate without a guard. Management is offering $ 46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation, but is tying the raise to increased productivity.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> today that his visit was evidence the superpowers are viewing each other more as partners than adversaries. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> in a Kremlin office on the last day of a 10-day visit in which <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> viewed military exercises in <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, looked at a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear submarine and traveled widely in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The very fact that you have visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and have visited military facilities and units demonstrates that we are moving from the notion of enemies to the notion of partners,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> in the presence of a handful of reporters. `` I believe that in the plans made by the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> we are still considered to be adversaries, but the process is going along new lines, and this is extremely significant,'' the president said. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, accompanied by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, then met with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, his military adviser Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> and military Chief of Staff <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON> for about an hour. `` Obviously there still are differences in our points of view,'' especially on arms control, <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said at a news conference later. But he added, `` The atmosphere for discussing them has improved markedly. `` I believe we now have an environment in which we can talk candidly, ask the kinds of questions that are important, we can talk without rancor or emotion,'' he said. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>'s visit followed a trip by <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He is to leave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> early Thursday. The visit came as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> resumed talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on reducing their arsenals of strategic nuclear missiles, negotiations that were stalled by disagreements and the change of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations. The two sides also are engaged in negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> spent much of his visit assessing changes in Soviet military policy under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The policy is based on the concept of `` reasonable sufficiency,'' that the country only needs enough soldiers and military hardware to defend itself. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the nation needs to redirect resources from the military to satisfy pent-up domestic demand for food and consumer goods. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> military academy last week that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still has `` overwhelming numbers'' and that he assumes it might attack. But he also said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must be given time to make good on promises to cut the size of its armed forces by 500,000 soldiers, take 500 nuclear weapons out of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and withdraw tanks and artillery. `` There is change afoot in this country, politically and militarily,'' <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> said today, adding that he found <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` very impressive.'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan to withdraw 500 tactical nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals on reducing conventional forces made him optimistic about superpower arms talks. `` We now believe there are some positive offers, some constructive offers on the table, that both sides are serious and sincere and that we can now continue the process of negotiations and some optimism,'' <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> said. But he said that it is dangerous for arms control negotiators to be rushed by a desire on both sides for disarmament.

<HEAD>Former Miller Brewing Employee Wins Worker's Comp Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Brewery employees drove a jittery <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran over the edge by making sudden loud noises so they could watch him throw himself to the floor, a panel ruled in awarding him $ 86,000 in worker's compensation. `` This is a case where the human insensitivity often witnessed in the children's schoolyard has reappeared in the adult workplace,'' two administrative law judges wrote in a decision in favor of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>. `` Such callous behavior is not merely reprehensible, but a disgrace.'' Co-workers at <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> learned he had been diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, including an exaggerated startle reaction, and `` preyed upon this startle reaction apparently for amusement or perhaps outright cruelty,'' said Judges <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneiders </PERSON>. From 1981 to 1983, co-workers dropped tables, broke beer bottles, dropped heavy equipment from forklifts, popped empty milk cartons and paper cups and set off fireworks. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> responded with a flash of fear and an increased heart rate and jumped or threw himself to the floor. A rocket set off in the lunchroom in <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON>'s direction so unnerved him that he was hospitalized for seven months for psychiatric treatment, the judges said last week. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON>, who left his job as a production worker in 1983 and never returned, suffers chronic anxiety, distrust of other people, depression, anxiety attacks and nightmares, the judges found. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and its insurance companies said the harassment or horseplay was not directed at <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION>, or if it was, it was not unusual stress. They also said his post-traumatic stress disorder resulted from combat, not what occurred at work. But the judges ruled that `` the campaign of terror and harassment'' was out-of-the-ordinary stress and noted that six psychiatrists and six psychologist found that <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON>'s current problems resulted from harassment. His lawyer, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Heitzer </PERSON>, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> had not worked since leaving <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The brewer and its insurers have three weeks to appeal. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Acly </PERSON> said the company was reviewing the decision.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has sued a suburb for denying a zoning permit for a home for retarded adults. The lawsuit filed Tuesday was the first brought by the federal government alleging housing discrimination against the handicapped under the Fair Housig Amendments Act that went into effect March 12, the department said. The department contends the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> denied the request in May because of neighbors' opposition `` based on fears and prejudices concerning the mentally retarded.'' The council in the suburb of 32,000 people denied a special-use permit for construction of a home for 15 adults in a neighborhood of single-family and two-family homes. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gliottoni </PERSON>, one of the five council members, said the council followed recommendations of the city's zoning board and its planning commission, as it almost always does. `` They are the sounding boards,'' <PERSON> Gliottoni </PERSON> said. `` They listen to all the people who are for it and all the people who are against it. We as council members have no input whatsoever.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said the case `` signals our determination to make sure that the handicapped enjoy the full benefits of the protections the act gives them.'' Under the new Fair Housing act, `` stereotypes and baseless fears concerning the handicapped can not be used to block the development of group homes,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said in the statement from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The lawsuit asks the federal court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to bar <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> from interfering with construction of the home and to assess unspecified damages and a penalty. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> defended the concept of group homes, which have encountered opposition from prospective neighbors and delaying tactics around the country. `` Studies have shown that these facilities are better for residents than the out-of-sight, out-of-mind institutions of the past, and that they have no adverse effects on the neighborhood,'' he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee says the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> should be allowed to keep the Trident submarine in its 1990 budget, but it wants a study on whether the one-a-year purchases are necessary. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> seapower subcommittee on Tuesday rejected 8-3 a plan by Rep. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., to replace the $ 1.28 billion Trident with a smaller Los Angeles-class attack submarine The attack subs are made by both the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes today bombed the headquarters of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla faction in the hills south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and officials said at least eight guerrillas were wounded. The Israeli army said its air force jets attacked targets that serve as the base for <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, head of the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said rescuers evacuated eight wounded guerrillas from the targeted site _ wooded hills of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> overlooking the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. The spokesman refused to say which faction the guerrillas belonged to. `` All planes returned safely, and the targets were damaged,'' the Israeli army said in an announcement from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. It made no mention of casualties. It was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ninth air attack into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year and the second in a week. On Friday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes raided south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camp. Police said two children were wounded in the attack. By police count, nine people have been killed and 60 wounded in the previous eight Israeli air strikes, which began Jan. 11. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s group is headquartered in the Syrian capital, <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, and maintains bases in a chain of tunnels across the <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> hills. A police spokesman said four warplanes blasted the hilltop positions in six runs spaced over one hour. Thick palls of dust and smoke billowed from the stricken targets. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> militia also has bases in the hills, and his militiaman blocked all roads leading to <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, firing AK-47 assault rifles into the air to prevent reporters from passing checkpoints to the stricken area. `` Civilians are not allowed into the area!'' shouted one militiaman as the raiding jets roared overhead. Several Israeli gunboats were seen cruising the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>. Two Israeli helicopter gunships approached the coast, drawing anti-aircraft fire from <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s militia and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas, but no hits were observed. The Palestinian guerrilla groups with bases in the area also include <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Nayef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawatmeh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it seems that the main target of the raid is the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a Druse militiaman. Israeli air, naval and ground forces fought a nine-hour battle with the faction in the <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> hills on December 9. At least eight guerrillas and a ranking Israeli officer were killed. Three Israeli soldiers and 16 guerrillas also were wounded in the December confrontation. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> held a news conference at the tunnel base shortly after the December battle and said helicopter-borne Israeli paratroopers had released a number of Doberman pinschers fitted with tear gas containers and explosives to chase his fighters across the tunnels. Reporters saw five Dobermans killed by guerrillas. The dogs had explosives and gas containers strapped around their bellies.

The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> operation about 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> is scheduled for October, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. A row of seats was sucked through the hole on the New Zealand-bound flight when the fuselage tore open. The pilots managed to get the crippled <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 back to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for a landing that saved the 345 people still aboard. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which requested the search, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to share the estimated $ 300,000 cost of recovering the door, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` At this time we intend to pursue getting it,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> told The Honolulu Advertiser. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> told the Advertiser the airline is willing to pay its $ 70,000 share and had been in contact with the safety agency. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Tuesday, `` I think we're proceeding to recover the door. But he said he did not know any details of the plan or how the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would do it. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators have said the door would help determine what caused the plane to pop open at 22,000 feet, ripping a 10-by-20-foot hole in the fuselage. In April, a three-day hearing on the accident failed to produce conclusive evidence of the cause. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> executives said then they wanted to see the door recovered. Negotiations were reported to be under way at that time on whether to retrieve the door and how the costs would be divided. Military radar had tracked an object believed to be the cargo door falling into the ocean at a point where the water is 16,800 feet deep. Soon after the mishap, undersea experts said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is probably the only agency with equipment capable of handling the recovery of the door. A search would probably involve use of a sonar sled and a remote-controlled vehicle with a camera, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolcott </PERSON>, a research submarine pilot at the <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Undersea Research Lab at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION>, said earlier this year. The vehicle could probably hook a line to the door to lift it to the surface, he said. The least likely possibility because of the tremendous cost _ up to $ 40,000 a day _ would be the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Sea Cliff, one of the world's few manned research submarines capable of reaching that depth, <PERSON> Wolcott </PERSON> said

 A witness testified he was told that movie producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and a drug dealer paid for the `` Cotton Club'' murder. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' lawyer called the accusation an `` outrageous lie.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, producer of such films as `` <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>'' and `` Marathon Man,'' has not been charged in the case. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rider </PERSON>, former security chief for Hustler magazine publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON>, testified Tuesday that defendant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> told him about the 1983 slaying of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theatrical producer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, who had been working with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> to finance the film `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> admitted he was one of the killers and named <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamota </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> as another, Rider testified at a preliminary hearing on murder charges against <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> and a third defendant, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>. `` Did Mr. <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> indicate to you that anyone else was involved in the killing of Mr. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>?'' asked Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn. </PERSON> `` Yes,'' said Rider, adding after prodding from <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>, `` Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>.'' `` Did he say what their involvement was?'' asked Conn. `` Yes, essentially that they paid for the contract,'' Rider said. Rider said <PERSON> Mentzer </PERSON> had mentioned two reasons why <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, the former chief of production at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>, a reputed drug dealer, would have wanted <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> killed. `` One variation was that Mr. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> was killed because of the stealing of Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON>'s drugs,'' Rider said, `` and the other version was Mr. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> tried to cut Mrs. <PERSON> Greenberger </PERSON> out of the movie deal.'' `` The Cotton Club'' was being financed in a deal between <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> when <PERSON> Radin </PERSON> disappeared. His body was found a month later in a dry river bed. He had been shot repeatedly in the head. `` Anybody who makes a statement that <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> is involved in this case is telling an outrageous lie. It's absolutely untrue,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. `` If the state believed it was true, he'd be a defendant, not a witness.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was called as a witness but declined to testify on grounds his answers might tend to incriminate him. The hearing before Municipal Judge <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence for those charged to stand trial. <PERSON> Radin </PERSON>, an obese, cocaine-sniffing impresario from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, appeared on his way to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> success in 1983, raising $ 35 million to finance `` The <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' a movie about a famous <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> nightspot. He was killed before the deal was completed, and others, including <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, ultimately produced the film.

 The early departure of a commuter train caught some passengers off guard but was even more surprising for the conductor and engineer, who were still in the station. None of the dozen or so passengers on the runaway <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> train were hurt in the incident Tuesday, which ended when a passenger pulled an emergency brake, halting the 96-seat train about 200 feet from the station. `` The car was n't going too fast, maybe 15 miles an hour or so, but we were going to <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> all right,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Comerford </PERSON>, a passenger. <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON> said the railroad was investigating what caused the 7:07 a.m. train to begin rolling at 6:57 a.m. without its engine engaged. Investigators were focusing on the electric switch that governs the brakes, he said. `` When the engineer and conductor came out to find their train missing, they were, we understand, somewhat surprised,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The superpowers held their first full meeting in the latest round of talks on cutting long-range nuclear arms, but chances of a breakthrough looked slim after both sides refused to budge on major issues. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was expected to propose verification measures aimed at speeding progress on a treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It was not clear when or in what detail the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side would present its proposals. Both sides were observing an official news blackout in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on the substance of the talks. On Tuesday, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a pact to cut each side's long-range nuclear forces is part of `` the next phase'' in disarmament. `` The basis for this already exists, and the oustanding questions are not insurmountable as far as we are concerned if the two parties make the necessary efforts,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a message carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The two new chief arms negotiators, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, led their delegations in the first full meeting of the 11th round of talks, a 2 -LCB- - hour session at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission Talks began in March 1985. The negotiations are on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, intended to cut long-range nuclear forces, and space and defense issues. The talks are aimed at reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent. This round, due to last about six weeks, began Monday with a meeting of the two delegation heads. Both <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> made plain that their public positions remain unchanged on several major issues, including mobile nuclear missiles. On Tuesday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested he might back away from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insistence on banning these weapons if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approves a plan for upgrading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic forces, according to congressional leaders who met with him. The plan would include funding for both the 10-warhead MX and the single-warhead Midgetman missiles. Two other disputes center on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans for space-based missile defenses and whether to include long-range sea-launched cruise missiles in START. Under a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-cheating plan outlined by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday, both sides would begin tackling the tricky problem of verification early by testing monitoring procedures during the talks, rather than waiting until the treaty is completed. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as saying such trial inspections would involve round-the-clock monitoring of some ballistic missile factories and on-site checks of missile warheads. The proposal also was reported to include a ban on some missile flight tests.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Iranian Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> discussed prospects for settling conflicts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in the first of two meetings between the leaders, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet president on Tuesday warmly greeted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, the highest Iranian official to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since the 1979 Iranian revolution, and met with him again today. The official Soviet news agency said Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> was meeting with <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister. Asked about possible arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, military chief of staff Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> would be meeting and said any decision would be made by `` the political leadership.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warmly greeted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and promised that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> will not damage <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s interests. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s strength will help improve relations, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Soviet leader said although relations between the neighboring countries have not always fared well, `` there can not be and will not be anything in our policy now that would damage <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s interests.'' The leaders discussed prospects for settling conflicts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and their attitudes toward other countries, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who before leaving <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> recalled that Russian empires always had coveted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, was reported to have listed areas of agreement between the two nations. They included universal disarmament, the question of foreign military in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, a neutral <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and national self-determination as areas where the two could come very close. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> expressed hope before he left home that the visit will open `` a new chapter in <LOCATION> Iranian-Soviet </LOCATION> relations and in the history of the region,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said earlier: `` In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> there is confidence that the visit by <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> will give fresh impetus to the continued progress of Soviet-Iranian relations ... and will help improve mutual understanding and strengthen cooperation between the two countries.'' His delegation included <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rezaie </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also is acting commander-in-chief of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces. Economics Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Iravani </PERSON> preceded <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to prepare economic and commercial agreements, the Iranian agency reported. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> officially has a non-aligned foreign policy, but <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said earlier this month that the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had instructed him to improve relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died on June 3. With ties to the West strained, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is looking to the Soviet bloc for help in rebuilding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Relations between <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> soured soon after the 1979 Iranian revolution. That December, Soviet troops deployed to help the Afghan government fight Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1981 repressed the <ORGANIZATION> Tudeh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was one of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s major arms suppliers in the Iran-Iraq war, which ended with an August 1988 cease-fire. Soviet-Iran relations improved when Soviet troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15.

Spec. 4 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who had been described as a model soldier, could receive a life sentence. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, 21, initially pleaded innocent to the espionage charges. He changed his plea today when his court martial began, said Maj. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 5th Corps. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to violating regulations banning travel by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military close to the East German border area; being absent without leave; and failing to obey regulations requiring him to obtain permission to travel to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said prosecutors dropped a charge of removing classified information because <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> pleaded guilty to espionage. On Feb. 21, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> disappeared from his unit in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, near the East German border, taking a portable computer from the office where he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist.

<HEAD>Times Says Home Mortgage Insurer's Reserves May Disappear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An audit of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is expected to show that its main mortgage insurance fund has been suffering losses at a rate that could run it dry in five months, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said today. The newspaper, citing government investigators and private auditors, said the findings will be contained in the first full audit of the 55-year-old agency, which insures $ 275 billion worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> home mortgages. It cited agency officials as saying the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> was down to a five-month reserve, $ 2.8 billion, to cover holders of defaulted mortgages. When the reserve runs out, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> must pick up the payments. The main fund is the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, which covers 5.5 million mortgages of up to $ 101,000 each on single-family homes. The insurance is financed largely by premiums paid by home buyers. Claims on the fund amounted to $ 2.9 billion in 1986, $ 4.4 billion in 1988 and will hit an estimated $ 6.6 billion this year, according to budget documents cited by the Times. It said that a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report last month put <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>'s losses for the year ending September 1988 at $ 452 million and that preliminary figures for the following six months indicated an additional $ 150 million in losses. Economic downturns, particularly in the oil industry in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, plus fraud, mismanagement and a sluggish housing market contributed to the agency's problems, the Times said. Senior officials of the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>'s parent organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, speaking anonymously, said the two consecutive years of losses did not pose a serious threat, the Times said. But a private auditor said he was less optimistic, particularly if there were a recession.

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who has been denounced as a traitor by ultra-nationalist Jewish settlers, urged Israelis not to battle among themselves over how to end the Palestinian uprising. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also endorsed a proposal to include Jewish settlers in army defense units in the occupied lands despite a recent rise in settler attacks on Palestinians. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, meanwhile, assailants shot and killed taxi driver <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharoub </PERSON>, a 47-year-old Palestinian who was suspected of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, radio reports and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists said. An army official confirmed a fatal shooting in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and said the circumstances were under investigation. <PERSON> Sharoub </PERSON>'s death brought to 527 the number of Palestinians killed in the 18 -LCB- - month uprising against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> The figure includes 64 suspected collaborators. Twenty-three Israelis also have died. Israeli newspapers reported today that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has asked Israeli experts to examine the legality of using harsher measures against Palestinians. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> reportedly wants to deport Palestinians within a week after such an order has been issued. Deportees now can appeal the order and the legal procedure can take months. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also wants to scrap the possibility of appealing army-ordered house demolitions, the <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. The army sometimes destroys or seals the homes of Palestinians suspected of attacks on Israelis. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has condemned the practice, saying it denies suspects due process of law because the army usually acts before a suspect has been tried. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has come under growing pressure from the extreme right to use harsher measures to quell the uprising. His critics also argue that his peace plan, based on elections in the occupied lands, will pave the way for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. On Tuesday, settlers shouted down <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as he spoke at the funeral of a U.S.-born <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settler allegedly slain by Palestinians. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio today that disagreements over government policies must not degenerate into domestic strife. `` We must do everything to make sure such a war never happens. This is the most dangerous thing,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. `` I would suggest to everyone to lower the profile of our internal debates, because if the profile rises you can slide into irresponsible actions,'' he added. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rival in the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, ultra-nationalist Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, was met by thunderous applause during Tuesday's funeral. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> has engineered a showdown with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> over the peace plan at a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> convention next month. A poll published by the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> daily Wednesday indicated <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had the support of 55 percent of the 2,600 members of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Twenty-one percent opposed it and 24 percent were undecided, the poll said. In an apparent bid to appease the settlers, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he backed a proposal to include them in regional defense units. `` We can definitely take this path,'' he said. In the past, settlers doing army reserve duty were barred from serving near their hometowns. Most Israeli men serve in the reserves for up to two months a year until age 54. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also criticized an attack Tuesday in which a 23-year-old Jewish settler fired at a group of Palestinians standing at an intersection near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Two Arabs were wounded, one of them seriously. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the assailant, who staged the shooting after attending the funeral of the slain settler, has a police record. `` We must prevent such actions. They only strengthen the other side, the extremists among the Arabs,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said.

 A Jewish leader said today he has received new assurances that a Roman Catholic convent on the grounds of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp will be finally be moved, ending a 5-year-old dispute. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, European director of B'Nai B'rith, said in a telephone interview that he was confident that the convent would be located after a conversation with Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> Cracow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, whose diocese includes <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. Under the terms of a 1987 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> declaration signed by 18 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders, <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> is charged with arranging the transfer of the convent, founded in 1984. Jews have protested the convent, located in a former storehouse on the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> camp perimeter, as a Christian symbol that intrudes on the place that was one of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s busiest extermination camps. <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> killed 6 million Jews during World War II. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> declaration recognized the special significance of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> in the holocaust, and called for the transfer of the convent's 14 Carmelite nuns within two years. When the deadline passed on Feb. 22, there were renewed calls for removal of the convent. There also was considerable opposition among <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Catholics but <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>, a co-signer of the declaration, said that in a June 7 letter <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> said this opposition was fading. Construction of a convent 500 yards from the camp would `` most probably'' begin early next year, the letter said. The letter `` makes plain that all preconditions exist now for the implementation of the accord,'' <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON> said. `` I never doubted that <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> would stick to the accord but it is a pity that all this could not be done already two years ago.'' <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> said in the letter that `` Jewish impatience ... is completely understandable'' but that protests only `` provoke adverse reactions from the population and strengthen it in the blind defense of the nuns. `` It would be sad if this would create a gulf between between Catholics and Jews in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' he wrote.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> authorities today publicly executed three men convicted of setting a train on fire during pro-democracy protests, and more people were sentenced to die in another city for their roles in the protests. The executions were the first announced since the June 3-4 military crackdown that crushed the student-led movement. The three died one day after <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s highest court rejected their appeals and just two weeks after their alleged crimes were committed. The men were shot to death in front of a crowd, said a spokesman at the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Foreign Affairs office. He said he did not know other details and refused to give his name. Death sentences in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> usually are carried out by a bullet to the back of the head. There is no record of a death sentence in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> being overturned on appeal, although they sometimes are commuted to life in prison. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western governments had appealed for clemency for the three, and for eight people in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also given death sentences in connection with the protests. But <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> radio, in announcing the court's rejection of the appeal, said, `` There are no legal reasons for mitigating the punishment of <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Guoming </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanwu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuerong </PERSON>.'' Xu and <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, who are workers, and <PERSON> Bian </PERSON>, who is unemployed, set fire to a train June 6 after it ran through a barricade set up by protesters and killed six people. The three were convicted Thursday. In the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION>, 45 people accused of taking part in protests were convicted in a mass trial before a crowd of about 10,000, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> radio reported. The report said some of the 45 were sentenced to death. Others received death sentences with a two-year reprieve. At the end of two years, the sentences could be reduced to life in prison for good behavior. Others were given life in prison or lesser terms according to the report, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It did not give a breakdown but said those given death were convicted of `` seriously endangering public order.'' An editor at the <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION> Daily, contacted by telephone, said 17 of the 45 were sentenced to death. He said he did not know if the figure included those given two-year reprieves. He said the trial was held Tuesday and no executions had been carried out. The stiff sentences came one day after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s supreme court ordered lower courts to deal swiftly and severely with people accused of taking part in the protests, which the party is condemning as counterrevolutionary rebellion. In other developments, the government today ordered colleges to set up new political education programs so students will learn to `` love socialism and love the army'' and accept official condemnation of the protests. New arrests were reported, raising the total reported nationwide to more than 1,600 since June 4, when the army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in crushing the student-led movement for a freer, less corrupt society. Authorities at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport arrested four people who were involved in the protests and trying to flee, the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said. It said two were women trying to board a Paris-bound plane under false names. It did not detail their alleged crimes. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> today condemned the executions as `` totally out of proportion to the crime'' and said she and Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> discussed steps against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during a meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Asked if they planned diplomatic or other reprisals against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said without elaboration that this had been discussed. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday ordered that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials suspend all high-level contacts with Chinese officials. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also said it would seek to postpone consideration of new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by international organizations in order to protest the harshness of the crackdown. In <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, officials said they arrested 44 `` ruffians'' who took part in protests in the capital. Among them were two members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, the independent student union that led seven weeks of pro-democracy protests. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> officials said 65 people had surrendered there, including 42 leaders of independent student unions and other illegal groups. It said they repented and some, after `` seeing the light,'' informed on others. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> sent a notice to all provincial and local governments ordering them to arrange `` political ideological education'' for college students, especially those graduating this year. The order, published in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, says the main `` weapon'' in such classes should be a June 9 speech by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> that claimed the students were used by anti-party plotters who sought to establish a Western-style democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said in the speech that the greatest mistake of his 10 years in power was a failure of political education of both the students and the public. `` The recent counterrevolutionary rebellion was a very good lesson,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Charter planes flew hundreds of weary tourists home today after they were plucked from a Soviet ocean liner that had crashed into an iceberg, cutting short a pleasure cruise to the land of the midnight sun. Workers plugged the holes on the 630-foot cruise ship <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> and the vessel steamed toward the island of <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION> today, escorted by two other Soviet vessels, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Maritime experts said the ocean liner, on a cruise to see the 24-hour summer light in the arctic, was moving too fast when it struck the ice in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, 300 miles east of northern <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and 180 miles west of <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION>. No one was seriously injured. Norwegian helicopters flew the aged and most infirm to safety, but some passengers spent up to seven hours huddled under blankets in lifeboats until they were picked up. Others waited on ice floes. For West German passenger <PERSON> Giesela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rillinger </PERSON>, `` It was six hours of nothing but ice floes and the sky. If a storm had come up it would have been all over for us. Six hours of facing death.'' The Norwegian <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> ship Senja evacuated 660 passengers _ all but about a dozen West Germans _ and 193 <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> crew members to <LOCATION> Longyearbyen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s administrative center on <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION> island, from where the tourists were flown to <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galimov </PERSON> and 192 other Soviet crew members remained on the <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Sigurd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON>, captain of the Senja. <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON> said it was <PERSON> Galimov </PERSON>'s first voyage in the area. Tour leader <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Prinz </PERSON> said he was standing on the bridge next to <PERSON> Galimov </PERSON> when the ship struck the iceberg. `` It happened very fast,'' <PERSON> Prinz </PERSON> told a reporter in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>. `` We went into the ice field without warning and unexpectedly, something nobody had counted on. The ship was cruising at normal speed, about 18 knots, so it was n't exactly slow, as the collision shook the ship,'' <PERSON> Prinz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON> said the liner was moving at 18.4 knots when it hit the ice, tearing a gash 20 feet long and four to six inches wide in the bow. `` I would hardly have sailed faster than two to three knots in such ice-clogged water,'' <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON> told reporters on board his coast guard vessel. `` There was fog in the area, and it seems to me as if the <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> may have sped too fast straight into the ice,'' <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON> said. But experienced <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> sailors agreed the <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> had sailed too fast in an area often clogged with ice. `` Not even the coast guard vessels sail faster than three to five knots in such waters,'' <PERSON> Guttorm </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, a skipper who has sailed the arctic for 40 years, told the <ORGANIZATION> Verdens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` The <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> must have been too eager to keep its schedule.'' The newspaper quoted other experts as saying that even if the captain had seen the ice from a distance of 10 miles it would have taken his ship up to 45 minutes to stop from a speed of 18 knots. The Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> said the ship today was moving at 4.5 knots toward <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION>, where it would receive emergency repairs. It was accompanied by a Soviet tugboat and a freighter. The ship set out June 11 from <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, sailed to <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and encountered its difficulties while sailing around the <LOCATION> Spitsbergen </LOCATION> archipelago on its way to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> had about 952 people aboard when it struck the ice early Tuesday while most passengers were partying in a shipboard nightclub. The luxury liner was built in 1969 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and sold to the Soviets in 1974.

<HEAD>Left-Wing Coalition Emerges As Kingmaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A left-wing alliance has emerged as power broker in efforts to build a coalition government, but <PERSON> Greeks </PERSON> girded for a political crisis and new elections. The alleged involvement of leaders of Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in financial scandals was blamed for its defeat in Sunday's election. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which finished first, today sought partners in an interim coalition government dedicated to investigating the scandals and prosecuting those reponsible. But the alliance of two communist parties has rejected a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> offer. The alliance also refuses to cooperate with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, making the possibility of new elections likely and paralyzing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which can not order an inquiry if the political parties can not form a government. Judicial investigators today asked <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to lift the immunity of two former ministers in the defeated socialist government _ former deputy premier <PERSON> Agamemnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON> and former Public Order Minister <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Petsos </PERSON> _ so they can be prosecuted on bribery charges. Under the constitution, ministers only can be prosecuted for criminal offenses committed while in office if parliament lifts their immunity. Under existing judicial regulations, the evidence against the two ministers remains secret until presented to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is to convene July 3. There is doubt whether it will do so because of the inability of <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' New Democracy, which won 144 of 300 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, to form a majority government On Monday, <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> was given three days to build a coaltiion. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party came second with 125 seats and the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which won 29 seats, has become a kingmaker in coalition talks. The communist alliance also has pushed for investigation of the financial scandals, and has refused to join a coalition with <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s party unless he and other party leaders it maintains are tainted by scandal resign. <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON> has been accused of allegedly receiving $ 2 million from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> is now under arrest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pending the hearing of an extradition request by the Greek government. <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON> was dropped from the socialist party's list of candidates following testimony in March by <PERSON> Yannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON> that <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON> received the money for helping pass a bank secrecy law that blocked investigators from checking into the troubled Bank of <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lawmakers passed a bill making gun owners subject to prison terms if their firearms are used by children to shoot someone. The Legislature acted after accidental shootings killed three children since June 5. `` We have experienced too many tragedies, and it's time to put an end to them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel who has pushed the proposal for two years. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the gun-safety bill 26-6 and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved it 71-39 on Tuesday. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was persuaded last week to include the bill in this week's special session, was expected to sign the measure. Under the bill, gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons in their homes could be charged with a felony carrying up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine if children 15 years and younger hurt someone with the firearms. If the child displays the gun in public, the gun owner could be charged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $ 500 fine. Exemptions are provided for hunting and target shooting accidents, shootings involving stolen guns and the guns of law enforcement officers or military personnel. The law also provides a seven-day delay before parents of a wounded child can be arrested on the felony charge. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, the bill's sponsor, described it as `` one of the most important pieces of legislation that we have addressed in years in this Legislature.'' His legislation gained national attention after three <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> children were killed and four wounded in seven accidents earlier this month. The bill requires gun-shop owners to post a sign explaining the law and to hand out a written warning to customers. The measure also directs the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> to prepare a gun-safety education program that lawmakers can consider next year. A lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the bill was acceptable. `` My job was to try to help produce a bill that had the potential to do some good and not just run willy-nilly, damaging additional lives,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> led the opponents in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which had approved a similar version during the regular session that ended June 3. `` This bill does not make common sense,'' <PERSON> Locke </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't put Mama and <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON> in jail, the kids in a foster home, the court system is full, the fails are full. Other opponents contended that more children are hurt and killed in accidents involving cars, pools, fires and household poisons than guns. Accidental gunshots are the fifth-leading cause of death of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children under age 14, and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has one of the three highest rates of accidental shootings in the country, according to Sen. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Malchon </PERSON>, who proposed similar legislation two years ago. Last year, 441 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> children were injured or killed by guns and another 3,110 were victims of crimes involving firearms.

 Two witnesses testified today that they saw the man accused of killing Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> outside the theater where the Swedish leader saw a movie before he was shot. The prosecution contends the defendant, <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, followed Palme from the theater and shot him on Feb. 28, 1986. <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, a drug and alcohol abuser with a previous manslaughter conviction, has maintained he is innocent. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostlund </PERSON>, 40, testified that he went into the theater lobby to make a telephone call when he saw spotted <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, whom he knew, outside. `` I was just about to call when I saw <PERSON> Christer </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ostlund </PERSON> said. `` I leaned out the door and wanted to talk with him, but he made a rejecting motion and then I thought, something's odd here.'' Under questioning by defense attorney <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liljeros </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ostlund </PERSON> said he had taken drugs that morning and drank wine in the afternoon. `` I was a bit tired'' that evening, he said. <PERSON> Ostlund </PERSON> said, however, he was `` absolutely sure'' he saw <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON>, who has maintained he was not in the area that night. <PERSON> Ostlund </PERSON> said he knew <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> from various prisons where they both served sentences.

Palme's widow, <PERSON> Lisbeth </PERSON>, identified <PERSON> Pettersson </PERSON> in court on Monday as the man she saw a few feet away immediately after her husband was shot. After today's testimony the trial was adjourned until next week.

<TEXT>
 The utility that operates the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear plant is taking bids for a takeover of the power station that voters decided to close. The 3-2 decision Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> to take bids over the next 10 days angered many of the activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant, which has a history of operating problems. The board majority argued that the June 6 ballot measure in which the electorate decided to close the plant does n't forbid someone else from runnning it. The sale of Rancho Seco would save the community the $ 200 million to $ 300 million cost of shutting it down, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Buonaiuto </PERSON>, board president. Voters earlier this month decided in a non-binding referendum to close the plant, agreeing with opponents' arguments that it is unsafe and uneconomical, and a majority of the utility board agreed to abide by the outcome. The plant was taken out of service June 7, and so far about 400 contract workers have lost their jobs. Sacramentans for Safe Energy, an anti-Rancho Seco group, has said it will sue to stop the transfer of <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> to businesses that might continue to operate it. `` We will wait and see what happens in the 10-day period,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Remy </PERSON>, an lawyer with the group. `` Our position still is that enough is enough.'' The plant, 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, has operated at 39 percent of capacity over its 15-year life. <ORGANIZATION> Quadrex </ORGANIZATION>, a nuclear power consulting company in <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has said it is interested in taking over the plant.

 An Iranian parliament member today criticized the foreign ministry's decision to allow the return of the West German and French ambassadors to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported.

Also today, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said nearly 180 members of the 270-member Majlis, or parliament, wrote to committee chairman <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshkini </PERSON> to express concern over proposed changes in the constitution that would allow the nation's supreme leader to dissolve the legislature.

Iranians are to vote on the new constitution and elect a president on July 28. The lawmakers said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had not asked the 20-member committee to review this issue and that the current constitution says the Majlis should be active under all circumstances. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial that `` the late imam believed that the supreme leader was above the three branches of government.''

<HEAD>Administration Opposes Bill to Deny Exxon a Cleanup Tax Deduction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration today opposed a bill aimed at denying <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> a tax deduction for costs of cleaning up the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill. `` The bill would violate the fundamental principle of business taxation that a taxpayer's ordinary and necessary business expenses may be deducted in computing net income,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON>, assistant treasury secretary for tax policy, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev., sponsor of the bill, said: `` I do not want to tell my constituents that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people owe <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest polluter in history, millions of dollars in a tax rebate in return for destroying the environment and raising prices at the gas pumps. Waving a handful of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> credit cards that irate customers had mailed him in protest, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> added: `` Given the company's dismal cleanup performance and the resultant permanent scar that now defaces <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s beauty, it is incomprehensible that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> should be able to claim its cleanup costs _ estimated at $ 500 million _ as an ` ordinary and necessary' cost of doing business. Some 10 million gallons of crude oil were spilled into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on March 24 when the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground A large share of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup costs apparently are covered by insurance. Under present law, any uninsured share could be deducted from taxable income as a cost of doing business. Because the top corporate tax rate is 34 percent, the effect would be for the federal treasury to pay 34 percent of the uninsured expenses. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s bill, which also would apply to any future chemical spill, would prohibit such a deduction unless the federal government certified that the cleanup had been conducted in accordance with the law. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, who said he supports the concept of <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s bill, pointed out that existing environmental laws contain no objective standards for determining whether a cleanup was proper. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huard </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes the bill, said the legislation likely would discourage corporate efforts to clean up spills. `` Because the sanctions ... are so draconian, a likely response is that taxpayers involved in oil spills or hazardous substance dischages will undertake very little cleanup activity on their own initiative, and instead will choose to protect the deductibility of their expenditures by awaiting specific directions from the applicable government agency,'' <PERSON> Huard </PERSON> said. The bill was supported by <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group. He said the legislation should be made tougher by denying `` tax deductions to spillers for oil or hazardous spill-related expenses without regard to adequacy of cleanup.'' `` Such an approach would send a message that would foster stronger preventive measures by industry,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipinski </PERSON>, D-Ill., who has introduced a companion bill to <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup expenses should not be tax-deductible because `` oil and toxic spill cleanup is not ` ordinary' and is not a ` necessary' business expense.

<HEAD>Utility Votes to Take Bids to Restart Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The utility that operates the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear plant is taking bids for a takeover of the power station that voters decided to close. The 3-2 decision Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> to take bids over the next 10 days angered many of the activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant, which has a history of operating problems. The board majority argued that the June 6 ballot measure in which the electorate decided to close the plant does n't forbid someone else from runnning it. The sale of Rancho Seco would save the community the $ 200 million to $ 300 million cost of shutting it down, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Buonaiuto </PERSON>, board president. Voters earlier this month decided in a non-binding referendum to close the plant, agreeing with opponents' arguments that it is unsafe and uneconomical, and a majority of the utility board agreed to abide by the outcome. The plant was taken out of service June 7, and so far about 400 contract workers have lost their jobs. The vote marked the first time citizens have decided to close an operating reactor. Sacramentans for Safe Energy, an anti-Rancho Seco group, has said it will sue to stop the transfer of <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> to businesses that might continue to operate it. `` We will wait and see what happens in the 10-day period,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Remy </PERSON>, an lawyer with the group. `` Our position still is that enough is enough.'' The plant, 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, has operated at 39 percent of capacity over its 15-year life. <ORGANIZATION> Quadrex </ORGANIZATION>, a nuclear power consulting company in <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has said it is interested in taking over the plant.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: June 17 The Journal, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ulm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, on the minimum wage bill veto: It certainly could have come as no surprise to anyone, the veto by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of the bill raising the minimum wage. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeatedly had made it clear that he would not sign legislation increasing the minimum wage beyond $ 4.25 per hour. He also insisted that the increase be accompanied by a subminimum training wage that employers could pay to all newly employed workers for as long as six months. The president maintained that to go any higher on the minimum wage would cause an unacceptable loss of jobs and add to inflationary pressure. Unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can come to some agreement, the end result will be that there will be no increase of any kind in the minimum wage this year. `` The working poor will be denied any increase at all because some people want to score a political point,'' noted <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. No doubt his political opponents will portray the president as being insensitive to the needs of the working poor because of the veto. We do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will buy such propaganda, however. The president had no choice but to disapprove the minimum wage bill. He had made his position clear and had to stick with it.

Everybody in the family should be carefully taught about handling pistols or rifles and about proper use of them. Young people see so much gunplay on television nowadays that it becomes rather routine and mundane in their minds. When weapons are around, children should be taught about the dangers guns pose in careless or untrained hands. Adults also stand constant reminding themselves. A state legislator from <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- re-introduced a bill that was killed in 1988 and died in committee this year to make the owner of a gun liable when the weapon is left within the reach of a child who shoots someone. ... Any rational person can imagine the horror facing parents whose children become cold statistics because of a combination of youthfulness, guns and adult irresponsibility. Owners of weapons that kill should bear some of the burden.

Others, led by our current president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> the Kind and Gentle Spy, and his drug czar, want the right to open fire on anyone decreed to be a `` drug trafficker.'' We elect a government to govern, not to run around killing people without trial, ceremony or second thought. Besides, murder is wrong, just as wrong for a bunch of `` pro-active'' pinheads who claim truth and justice is on their side as it is for you and me.

 June 16 The <LOCATION> Hemet </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- News on the minimum wage bill veto: President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of the minimum-wage increase _ which the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed to override _ accomplished two things. First, it prevented congressional demagogues from destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs for poor people in the name of `` compassion.'' But more important, it showed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is willing to unleash one of his office's most powerful weapons. ... Was this particular veto justified? Absolutely. By hiking the minimum wage more than one-third _ to $ 4.55 an hour _ the congressional bill would have effectively prevented employers from hiring many first-time or poorly-prepared workers. Instead of low-paying jobs, many low-skilled youths from the inner cities would have found themselves with no jobs at all. ... His own proposal would have raised the minimum wage from the current $ 3.35 per hour to $ 4.25, but would have allowed employers to pay a lower amount during a worker's first six months on the job. The congressional bill would have restricted the training wage to a mere 60 days. Predictably, the unions' allies on Capitol Hill are denouncing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto as anti-worker. But if the president wants to do good rather than just look good, holding firm on such issues is the best course for him to take.

 June 16 The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on Chinese dissidents: While Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't want to inflame the situation by posturing, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was nevertheless straightforwardly vocal ... in flatly stating its intention to protect Chinese dissidents <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must not waver in its commitment to this couple, even if it means letting them stay indefinitely at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The importance of that commitment exists on two levels _ one personal, the other symbolic. With several executions already ordered by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> is in grave personal danger, since the `` crime'' he is accused of is comparable to treason. On a broader scale, since <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and his wife are aligned with the aspirations of the student democracy movement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treatment of them will also inevitably symbolize its regard for the movement, as well as its commitment to the ideals of free expression and democracy. Author <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Schell </PERSON> wrote for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> ..., `` <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> have begun searching for ways to divert attention from the carnage they wrought in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on June 3.'' He was referring to their singling out of <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> as an `` archenemy of the nation.'' Since that piece was written, the government has moved on, adding two Western journalists as still more diversions, still more objects of contempt. It is a familiar maneuver for Chinese officials.

It is vital that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> make known, through both words and deeds, that it deplores the mass arrests, the planned executions, the attempt to rewrite history, the intention to arrest dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and the expulsion of journalists.

 June 17 The <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> on a healthy start program for infants: Children deserve the best possible start in life. That means their mothers must have adequate prenatal care, a relative luxury for the thousands of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> women not fortunate enough to be covered by insurance yet not needy enough to qualify for Medicaid. It is for these women, and their infants less than a year old, that <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s Healthy Start program was designed. Now legislators seem inclined to expand <ORGANIZATION> Healthy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, to include women whose family incomes are higher than current ceilings set by the state. That's not just a compassionate gesture; in the long run, it would prove cost-effective, too. Healthy Start pays all prenatal doctor bills, whatever prescription costs the woman incurs during pregnancy and all expenses associated with labor and delivery. In addition, the program covers the costs of the mother's medical care for 60 days after delivery and the infant's for a full year. Obviously, a baby who is immunized and whose growth and development are tracked by a doctor will have an edge over one lacking such attention. The benefits of prenatal care may seem murkier but are no less compelling. The longer a woman delays prenatal visits to a doctor, the more likely she is to bear a child needing medical attention because of prematurity, low birth weight or some other complication. Experts calculate that every $ 1 spent on prenatal care saves $ 3.38 that would otherwise have to be spent later on a youngster born with problems.

In addition, individual vendors and service contractors may not contribute to a candidate for three years. ...

 In an unprecedented move, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans today asked the ethics committee to investigate GOP Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, convicted last month of charges stemming from his sexual relationship with a 16-year-old girl. The House Republican Conference, the organization of all <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, took the action in a closed-door meeting at the behest of its top leadership, according to a statement issued by Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. Such a request virtually ensures that the ethics panel will open a formal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who was convicted May 30 in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, of contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a minor. He is appealing. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said the move `` reflects our total commitment to standards of behavior for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which reflect honorably on the institution and the nation.

He said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> will live up to its constitutional obligation to police its own members `` no matter how distasteful or painful.'' Despite <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>'s comments, the move was seen as a pre-emptive strike by Republicans and an effort to keep Democrats on the defensive on the ethics issue, which the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has said will be its main emphasis this year. The ethics committee likely would have investigated <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> anyway. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said: `` Congressman <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> welcomes a full and open investigation that may once and for all bring forth the truth about this entire episode. In fact, this will probably assist in our appeals.'' <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was hampered in court because he was not permitted to cast doubt on the motives and credibility of the girl and her mother, who were <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' accusers. `` Now we'll be able to bring forth the background and the motives'' of the two, he said. The jury found <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> guilty of the misdemeanor charge based on its conclusion that he had sex with the girl at his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment last November. Such a conviction does not automatically deny <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> the right to serve in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or seek re-election. The resolution asking for an investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> requests that the ethics panel, formally called the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, `` determine whether Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> failed to conduct himself at all times in a manner which reflects creditably on the House of Representatives.'' The source, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the resolution was passed by a show of hands on a `` substantial'' majority. In presenting the resolution, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said it was unprecedented for the conference to call for an ethics probe of one of its own members. And another member of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, suggested Democrats might do well to turn the ethics spotlight on their own bad apples. `` We have taken that step of asking for an investigation,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` I think it's an appropriate kind of step to suggest that the other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of tough thing that is involved in what our conference did today.'' The document notes that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, `` in order to perform their constitutional duties, must conduct themselves with integrity'' and that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules require conduct which will not bring disrepute on the institution. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, 58 and divorced, has said he planned to fight the conviction and remain in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the meantime. `` I refuse to allow the lies and deceit of one delinquent individual to ruin me. I am now fighting for my life,'' he said in a statement following his conviction. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said in that statement that his accuser had `` fantasies of ` getting even with the establishment.''' But the court refused to allow him to bring up evidence he wanted to present to raise doubts about her reliability, the conservative lawmaker said. Since the conviction, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> will not be on the party's ticket in 1990 based on opposition from local party officials. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues also have distanced themselves from him. His conviction has harmed their cause at a time when they have been seeking to use the ethics issue against Democrats. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> is currently in the second term of his second stint in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He also was in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for two terms from 1967 to 1971.

<TEXT>
 An anticipated <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> showdown over state child pornography laws fizzled today when the justices, in splintered voting, sent a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> case back to that state's courts The court told the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether a since-amended state law can be used to prosecute <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Holden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, for `` soliciting a child to pose ... in a state of nudity ... for pornographic purposes.'' Today's ruling is a setback for <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, who had been freed from any criminal liability by the state's highest court. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> was criminally convicted in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said that in 1984 he induced his 14-year-old stepdaughter to pose for photographs while clothed only in bikini underpants and a scarf. Police were contacted after the girl's mother discovered the photos. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and was paroled after two years. The state's highest court threw out <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>' conviction and dismissed the criminal indictment against him. The state court said the 1982 law under which <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> was prosecuted was too broad, and criminalized `` conduct that virtually every person would regard as lawful.'' `` For example,'' the state court said in its ruling, `` -LRB- the law -RRB- makes a criminal of a parent who takes a frontal view picture of his or her naked 1-year-old running on a beach or romping in a wading pool.'' The law later was amended to add a `` lascivious intent'' requirement. Today's decision was accompanied by three written opinions but no majority opinion attracting at least five justices. Four of the court's members, led by Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, said the issue of whether the original <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law was overbroad became moot when it was amended. Two justices _ <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> _ voted to reverse the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> court and rule that <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>' prosecution was constitutional. `` Perhaps I am wrong in my estimation of how frequently the posings prohibited by -LRB- the old law -RRB- are done for artistic purposes, or for family photographs, or in some other legitimate and constitutionally protected context I have not envisioned,'' <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> wrote in an opinion joined by <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>. `` We can deal with such a situation in the unlikely event some prosecutor brings an indictment,'' he said. Three justices _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> _ said the court should uphold the state court decision and rule that the original child-porn law violated free-speech rights. Writing for the three, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunbathing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a nudist group, told the court that photographs taken of its 30,000 members in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> could lead to prosecutions under the old <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law. The case is <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, 87-1651.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today limited the power of states to outlaw the desecration or destruction of the American flag. The justices, voting 5-4, threw out the conviction of a protester sentenced to a year in jail and fined $ 2,000 for burning the flag in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In another case, the court limited states' power to punish the news media for printing truthful, legally obtained information. It threw out a $ 97,500 award against a newspaper won by a rape victim whose name it published. The court said a flag-burning at a demonstration in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> during the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form of expression protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, writing for the court, said, `` If there is a bedrock principle underlying the 1st Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.'' `` We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents.'' Joining <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> were Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The dissenters were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, in an opinion joined by <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, said the flag is a unique national symbol and deserves unique protection. `` The government may conscript men into the armed forces where they must fight and perhaps die for the flag,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. `` But -LRB- because of today's ruling -RRB- the government may not prohibit the public burning of the banner under which they fight.'' Today's ruling might permit states to outlaw flag burning in some cases. For example, a flag burning that led to a riot could still be illegal. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> already has a law banning conduct that leads to breaches of the peace, and that is not affected by today's ruling But <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said it violates constitutional free-speech guarantees to ban flag burning at political rallies or protests merely because the destruction of the flag offends some people or because the state wishes to preserve the flag as a symbol of national unity. During the height of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the fighting in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, draft-card burning and falg-burning were common forms of protest. In a separate dissenting opinion, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, `` sanctioning the public desecration of the flag will tarnsh its value _ both for those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.'' In an unusual move, both <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> read extensively from their opinions in the crowded courtroom today. Normally, justices only give brief summations of opinions at most when the rulings are announced. At the center of today's case is <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. He was arrested in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1984 following a protest that ended in front of city hall with demonstrators pouring lighter fluid on and igniting an American flag authorities said was taken from a pole outside a bank building. The protesters chanted, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the red, white and blue, we spit on you.'' Police said the demonstrators also overturned potted plants and spray-painted buildings during a destructive march through the city. But the only crminal charge was against <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> for violating a state law that forbids `` the desecration of a venerated object'' if that is likely to cause `` serious offense.'' Police officers who arrested <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said they were seriously offended by the flag burning. Also, an employee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> said he was so upset that he collected the charred fragments of the flag and later buried them in his backyard. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> denied he actually doused or ignited the flag, but said he approved the action and gave speeches during the rally. He said he was singled out for prosecution because <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police knew he was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s jury conviction was overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> which said the flag burning was a form of symbolic speech protected by the Constitution. The appeals court did not overturn the law itself, leaving open the possibility that flag burning in some cases would not be a form of speech and could be prosecuted. Many states and the federal government have laws against desecrating the flag. But their enforcement is spotty. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1943 ruled that the government may not compel citizens to salute the flag. The justices in 1974 threw out the conviction of a college student who taped a peace symbol onto a flag. But the high court previously had not ruled on whether outlawing the desecration or destruction of the flag violates the Constitution. Civil libertarians and some famous artists rallied to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s support While not backing his political views, they said laws like the one in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> could permit prosecutors arbitrarily to decide what is permissible dissent. Some said, for example, the law could be used to outlaw the burning of a flag in a movie about anti-war protests. Veterans groups and conservative organizations that supported the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law said the government should be allowed to ban destructive conduct that threatens the flag as a symbol of national unity. In the newspaper case, the court voted 6-3 to throw out the award won by a rape victim from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> weekly newspaper, saying it violated free-press rights protected by the Constitution's First Amendment. In other action, the court: _ Ruled that a federal law allowing public scrutiny of governmental advisory groups does not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s role in picking federal judges. Voting 8-0, the justices allowed the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s deliberations to remain largely secret. _ Sent back to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> courts a case involving state child pornography laws. The court told the state's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to decide whether a since-amended state law can be used to prosecute <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Holden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, for `` soliciting a child to pose ... in a state of nudity ... for pornographic purposes.'' The ruling is a setback for <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>, who had been freed from any criminal liability by the state's highest court. The flag-burning case is <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 88-155.

<HEAD>Court Rules Federal Law Does Not Apply to ABA Role in Picking Judges</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that a federal law allowing public scrutiny of governmental advisory groups does not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s role in picking federal judges. Voting 8-0, the justices allowed the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s deliberations to remain largely secret. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, in his opinion for the court, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did not intend the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s confidential relationship with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in selecting judges to be made public when it passed a law covering adivisory committees. Tipping the balance in favor of confidentiality, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said, is the risk that public disclosure of <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> deliberations would infringe improperly on the president's power to nominate federal judges. But <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> stopped short of declaring that the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president guarantees the confidentiality of the deliberations. Today's ruling upheld a federal judge's decision last year barring application of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest lawyers' organization, has for some 40 years played a key role in advising presidents on nominees to the federal bench. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asks the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s judiciary committee for confidential evaluations of possible judicial nominees. The panel is the only non-government group that routinely is told of potential nominees before the names are made public. <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> evaluations are made public after a nomination is submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ although the substance of the deliberations generally remains secret. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>, after interviewing lawyers, judges, professors and the nominee, rates potential nominees as exceptionally well qualified, well qualified, qualified or not qualified. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> is not required to reveal who was interviewed or any specifics of the process. A controversy over the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s role was ignited when the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> panel was divided over former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> committee members of being politicallly motivated in questioning <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s fitness to be a justice. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination after a long, bittr fight in which opponents said he was too rigidly conservative. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal public-interest organization, joined forces in seeking to compel the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> committee to reveal its deliberations. The former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposed the move. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last year said the Federal Advisory Committee Act is aimed at special groups and the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> panel does not fit into that category. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> did not take part in today's ruling. The cases are Public Citizen vs. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, 88-429, and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, 88-494.

<HEAD>Florida Paper That Identified Rape Victim Wins Vindication</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case stemming from publication of a rape victim's name, today limited the power of states to punish the news media for reporting truthful, lawfully obtained information. By a 6-3 vote, the court threw out a $ 97,500 award against a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> weekly newspaper won by a rape victim whose identify was included in a published report about the crime. The justices said the award violates free-press rights protected by the Constitution's First Amendment. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law makes it a crime to `` print, publish or broadcast'' the names of victims of sexual offenses. `` Our holding today is limited,'' Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> wrote for the court. `` We do not hold that truthful publication is automatically constitutionally protected, or that there is no zone of privacy within which the state may protect the individual from intrusion by the press,'' he said. The decision also did not preclude the possibility of a state punishing publication of a sex offense victim's name, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` We hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful information which it has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully be imposed, if at all, only when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order.'' That interest was not present in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper that primarily serves the black community in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, could have been put out of business if forced to pay the award, its lawyers had told the justices. The Star obtained the rape victim's name, identified in court documents only by the initials B.J.F., from a report posted in the sheriff's department press room in the fall of 1983. Most news organizations, including The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, have policies against publication of rape victim's names. But publication of B.J.F.'s name occurred erroneously, the newpaper's lawyers said. The victim sued the sheriff and the newspaper. She won $ 2,500 from the sheriff and $ 97,500 from the paper. In <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, an assistant deputy state attorney general, said the attorney general's office will review the decision when it is received and then make appropriate recommendations to state lawmakers and prosecutors. He said he was uncertain of the impact of the decision without seeing the full opinion. `` We would urge, in the interest of protecting the victims of crime, that the news media continue to adhere to their policy of not publishing the names of rape victims,'' he said. The publisher and editor of the Star were both out of the office this morning and unavailable for comment, said a newsroom employee. In reversing the award, the high court noted its past decisions on the `` tension between the right which the First Amendment accords a free press'' and `` the protection which various statutes and common-law doctrines accord to personal privacy.'' The court in 1975 barred states from imposing sanctions for the publication of truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection. The information in that case also was a rape victim's name. A 1977 decision struck down a state law that barred the news media from publishing the name or photograph of an 11-year-old boy in connection with a juvenile court proceeding reporters had attended. And in 1979, the court invalidated a state law that made it a crime for newspapers to publish, withut written approval of a juvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender _ even if that information were obtained lawfully. In today's decision, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law does not make it a crime for a private citizen to maliciously spread word of the identity of a rape victim. The law only targets such identifications by an `` instrument of mass communication.'' `` When a state attempts the extraordinary measure of punishing truthful publication in the name of privacy, it must demonstrate its commitment to advancing this interest by applying its prohibition evenhandedly, to the small-time disseminator as well as the media giant,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> wrote. He added: `` Without more careful and inclusive precautions against alternative forms of dissemination, we can not conclude that <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s selective ban on publication by the mass media satisfactorily accomplishes its stated purpose.'' The state law served as the basis of B.F.J.'s negligence lawsuit. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s opinion was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> concurred in the result.

Writing for the three, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, `` I would find a place to draw the line higher on the hillside: a spot high enough to protect B.J.F.'s desire for privacy and peace of mind in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy.'' He added: `` There is no public interest in publishing the names, addresses and phone numbers of persons who are the victims of crime _ and no public interest in immunizing the press from liability in the rare cases where a state's efforts to protect a victim's privacy have failed.'' The case is The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> vs. B.J.F., 87-329.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee approved a one-year ban on oil exploration in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and voted to continue bans on drilling in areas offshore <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. The action Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on the interior marked a significant expansion of limits on the oil industry's offshore drilling efforts and reflects political backlash from the Exxon spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> last March. The ban is attached to a spending bill that will take effect on Oct. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to consider the legislation next Tuesday. The measure also asks <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> to study options for buying back approximately $ 95 million in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> development leases sold to oil companies last October. The oil industry considers <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> a prime prospect. The panel also recommended continuing for another year existing bans on drilling in offshore areas in northern and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Environmental considerations linked to drilling in those areas is under review by a task force appointed last March by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It is due to report to him next January.

 Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> used troops to quell student demonstrations during the 1960s and should not criticize <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for its crackdown on dissidents, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper reported. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday published the full speech <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> delivered to senior military officials on June 9, five days after the army entered <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to put down the pro-democracy movement. Portions of the speech, which were broadcast on national Chinese television, had been reported previously. The newspaper did not say how it obtained the full text of the speech. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for suppressing students but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also mobilized troops against student rioters in the 1960s and 1970s. `` They were suppressing students and the people, but we are quelling counterrevolutionary riots. What qualifications do they have to criticize us!'' he said. In his speech, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said the pro-democracy protesters hoped to `` topple the Chinese Communist party and to overthrow the socialist order ... Of course these slogans are just a front ... Their goal is to establish a totally Westernized bourgeois republic.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said that in the course of quelling the rebellion, many people died. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has maintained that less than 300 people died, about half of them soldiers. Western intelligence sources and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students have estimated that up to 3,000 may have been killed in the June 3-4 incident. `` No matter how heavy our losses, and in spite of the change of generations, this army of ours is forever an army under the leadership of the party, forever the defender of the country, forever the defender of socialism, forever the defender of public interest,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said. He indicated in the speech that the student-led protest movement, which lasted seven weeks, was inevitable. `` This storm was bound to come sooner or later ... We are fortunate that it has come about now, mainly because we have a large group of senior comrades who are still alive. They have experienced many storms and they know the cause of effects of things,'' the 84-year-old leader said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> stressed that the basic concept of reform and openness for the past 10 years is correct and indicated that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wants to maintain economic ties to the rest of the world. `` Without reform and openness, how could we have what we have today?'' He said the results of the economic reforms that began in 1979 should be carefully assessed. `` We must persist in the coordination between a planned economy and a market economy. There can not be any change in this policy ... What is important is that we should never change <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into a closed country.'' He urged more investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` even if it involves heavy debts.'' However, less than two weeks after <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s speech, Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON> said it will put a halt to all economic aid negotiations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> supplies 80 percent of the international credit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> receives. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> announced it was tightening diplomatic and financial pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, including postponing new loans.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Wednesday turned over the remains of 28 people believed to be American servicemen, and it plans to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials another 16 sets of remains. Maj. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Trout </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman, said a 21-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team received the remains at a ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s international airport He said it was learned that 16 other sets would be turned over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but no date has been set. Wednesday's release was the 10th since August 1987, when a senior delegation to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> obtained promises from the Vietnamese to step up efforts to resolve the issue of Americans missing in action. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has repeatedly said it hopes to establish diplomatic and economic ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The unresolved MIA issue, as well as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, have been major barriers to this. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has promised to pull all its troops out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September and has dramatically improved cooperation on the MIA issue. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military teams have been allowed into the Vietnamese countryside in joint MIA searches, and the number of turnovers of remains has increased. In a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said it was conceivable that U.S.-Vietnamese links could be forged in 1990. Trout said the 28 remains were delivered in wooden boxes, inspected by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forensic expert and then transferred to aluminum caskets. An honor guard saluted as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags were placed on each casket. The caskets were loaded onto a C-141 transport aircraft, which flew them to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> for identification at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military laboratory. Since August 1987, 212 sets of remains have been turned over, and 56 have been identified as Americans. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says 2,353 Americans are still listed as missing in action from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war. Some Americans believe <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is also holding living Americans, but <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has denied this. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the past accused <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> of releasing remains at politically oportune moments. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, in turn, has accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of using the MIA issue to punish <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, by linking its resolution to economic aid and establishment of diplomatic ties.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s governing party leader, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, began a European tour Wednesday, the highest-ranking South African to visit since President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> came in 1984. Forty members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> signed a motion in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> urging Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> not to see <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who is expected to become <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s president in September. They described the visit as `` unwelcome, untimely and damaging to the prospects of dismantling apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and establishing peace in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> became head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in February, shortly after <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered a stroke. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, the head of government since 1978, has indicated he will step down as president after parliamentary elections in September. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is virtually certain to win the polls, designated <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> as <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s successor. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> he looked forward to meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the West's most outspoken opponent of imposing tough sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. This year, after visiting two of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s neighboring black states, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> pledged to increase contact with South African leaders. She said that is the best way of pressing for an end to apartheid and the release of black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. Asked if he thought Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> could help end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s isolation, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said, `` I do n't want to comment on her specific role. `` She has always taken a principled stand from her viewpoint and we do n't want to misuse her in any sense of the word whatsoever,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> added. `` Basically, the state of relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has always been good and we hope that it will remain so _ and obviously we hope that it will improve.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> also will go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. He will meet West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Thursday and then return to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for talks with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Friday. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is the highest-ranking South African official to visit <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> came five years ago. During that visit, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared that `` apartheid is dead.'' He returned home to install a new constitution that ensured continued rule by the white minority. Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arms delegates on Wednesday held the first full meeting in a new round of negotiations to cut each side's long-range nuclear arsenals by up to half. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was expected to propose verification measures aimed at speeding progress on a treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but it was not clear when or in what detail the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side presented its proposals. Both sides were observing an official news blackout in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on the substance of the talks. Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnik </PERSON> suggested it was too early to say where the round is headed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday proposed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should begin testing verification procedures during negotiations on reducing long-range nuclear forces, rather than waiting until a pact is completed. The new chief Soviet arms negotiator, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON>, said he would wait for formal submission of the proposal before commenting. On Tuesday, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said a treaty reducing each side's long-range, or strategic, forces is part of `` the next phase'' in disarmament. `` The basis for this already exists, and the oustanding questions are not insurmountable as far as we are concerned, if the two parties make the necessary efforts,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nazarkin </PERSON> and the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief envoy, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, led their delegations in the first plenary session of the 11th round of talks, a 2 -LCB- - hour session at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks began in March 1985. No date was announced for the next session. The round, due to last about six weeks, began Monday with a meeting of the two delegation heads. Rapid progress in the talks appears unlikely, since both sides have opposing positions on at least three major issues: the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for space-based missile defenses, the long-range sea-launched cruise missiles and the mobile intercontinental missiles. Along with efforts on an arms treaty, negotiations are also resuming on space and defense. The Soviets want to link agreements in the two areas, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has refused. Under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan, both sides would begin tackling the tricky problem of verification early by testing on-site monitoring procedures during the talks, rather than after the treaty is finished. The talks aim at a treaty reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 to 50 percent. Many parts of the draft text have been agreed, including lower ceilings of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers _ for each side.

 Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has always had difficulty persuading its students and scholars to return home from abroad to an uncertain economic, academic or personal future. Now, after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement, it may be impossible. The result could be a continuing and damaging brain drain for a nation whose leaders have been trying to bring it fully up to modern standards. Since the June 3-4 military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the major host countries for Chinese students have announced that Chinese may extend their stays. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, home to half of the 80,000 Chinese studying abroad, says they can stay at least another year. Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told the nation's 4,000 Chinese students they can stay until the situation in their country stabilizes. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is extending visas for its 3,500 Chinese students, as are <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> says nearly all of the 10,000 students there have inquired about prolonging their stay. `` I would say that all of them will stay if possible,'' said <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> student who returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after obtaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. Before June, most gave up their motherland because of economic reasons. Chinese scientists or engineers who could command high salaries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had little incentive to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for jobs that pay less than 200 yuan -LRB- $ 54 -RRB- a month. The newspaper Economic Information recently acknowledged many stay away because of a lack of suitable jobs in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and a rigid seniority system that stifles their talents. Many also fear they never will be permitted to go abroad again, it said. Many fear the more threatening prospect of being drawn into the vortex of political repression. Thousands of Chinese abroad marched in demonstrations or expressed sympathy for the democratic goals of the students in Tiananmen Square. Many face certain repercussions _ from political indoctrination to jail _ if they return. `` If <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> becomes a democratic country, I will go back,'' said <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Songnian </PERSON>, a physicist at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` But in this situation, certainly not.'' The Chinese government, which began sending students abroad a decade ago under senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s open-door policy, has generally shrugged off the brain-drain problem. The government says about 90 percent of the 35,000 state-funded students aboard will come home. Many have little choice. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries have ensured that students do not overstay their visas, and students usually are forced to leave their families behind in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The government has far less control over private students _ usually younger and more independent _ who receive scholarships or financial support from overseas relatives. `` Many private students will try to transfer to Canadian schools after their American visas expire,'' Miss <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> said. `` They will think of everything they can'' to avoid coming back. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> so far has shown no signs of stopping its foreign studies programs, partly because the children of senior leaders are among the beneficiaries. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> are two of the many officials whose children have studied abroad. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, however, has tried to tighten controls by limiting scholarships to older, postgraduate students with greater job and family ties at home. Last year, universities sent only 600 students abroad, while 4,000 went from research centers and institutes. Almost all are in engineering, science and other applied fields. `` It is the students' unshirkable duty and responsibility to come back on schedule to serve the country when they have finished their studies,'' educator <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xinbai </PERSON> said last year. But for the hundreds of young people whose visions of a freer <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were shattered by the tanks rolling into <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, thoughts are mainly of escape. `` I'm just trying to leave the country,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student. `` For more than 2,000 years, Chinese have put up with governments like this. It will take a long time to change.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will veto major child-care legislation being advanced by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats and a Republican if it reaches the White House in its present form, the administration said today. A letter from the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> distributed on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> said the multibillion-dollar package before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> `` violates all of the president's principles.'' The letter said the revised measure before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was an improvement over the original bill but remained `` fundamentally flawed.'' It said the measure would restrict parental choice in child care, provide assistance only to families who pay for child care and discriminate against low-income parents who have other family members care for their children. The White House is backing an alternative Republican package. The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> letter said that if the plan favored by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership `` were presented to the president, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto it.'' The statement was distributed as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP leaders sought support for the alternative. Debate on the issue continued in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today, but no votes were scheduled until Thursday. The criticisms in the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> letter were similar to those raised by many Republicans during the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s five days of debate on the issue. The points prompted Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> who co-sponsored the Democratic bill, to lash out at his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues. `` I'm ashamed when I hear some of the arguments that I've heard on this floor,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said Tuesday, accusing critics of spreading `` misinformation and disinformation and distortions.'' `` I have no respect for people who distort the facts,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` We have an obligation to tell the truth and let the chips fall as they may.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who has been critical of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's competing child care proposal, said he believed provisions of the president's tax-credit package could be merged with the revised Act for Better Child Care sponsored by <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. `` This should not be a partisan political issue,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> `` We're willing to do what it takes to get a child care bill and we do n't care who gets the credit for it.'' Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had planned to offer a White House-backed alternative to the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> plan on Tuesday but held off as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership sought support from Southern Democrats. It relies almost exclusively on tax credits, including an expansion of the existing earned income tax credit for low-income families with children under the age of 5. Like the Dodd-Hatch proposal, the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> alternative would provide up-front money to families that otherwise could not take advantage of the existing dependent care tax credit because of low income. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also called for a $ 400 million block grant program states could use to fund programs designed to improve the quality and quantity of child care. And, borrowing a proposal from Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> proposed exempting child care earnings from the outside income limitations faced by Social Security recipients <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and other Republicans have touched on their plan during the four days of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate. Democrats, joined by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, have called it inadequate while offering to merge its tax credit provisions with the direct subsidies provided to parents and child care providers under the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> plan. Benefits under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan would be available mainly to those making under $ 10,000 a year. The Democratic subsidies would be available according to formulas determined at the state level. An aide to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> predicted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s effort to substitute his proposal for the Dodd-Hatch measure would fail. `` Senator <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has proven in the past that he knows how to count,'' the aide said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, unable to reach agreement with Republicans on a timetable to bring the issue to a final vote, warned he would delay a two-week <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recess due to begin next week if debate and amendments prevented a final vote by Friday. `` This is a very important matter,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` We're going to stay as long as it takes.'' With <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> holding his plan, the highlight of Tuesday's debate was <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>'s angry criticism of fellow Republicans and conservatives. Waving a copy of a circular distributed at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> caucus that attacked the Dodd-Hatch bill, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said he did not mind arguments over honest disagreements but added: `` I mind people who try to win their case with falsehoods.'' He said the letter was on paper without a letterhead. `` I do not know who prepared this piece of junk.'' As revised, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill would authorize $ 1.75 billion for child care programs in fiscal 1990, with 70 percent of the money going to low-income parents to help them pay for child care. The remaining funds would go to states for programs to improve the quality and quantity of available child care.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier for Government to Conduct Tax-Fraud Investigations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a partial victory for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in its legal battles with the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION>, today made it easier for the government to conduct tax-fraud investigations. The justices ruled 8-0 that judges privately may examine communications between lawyers and clients to determine whether such information should be turned over to the government. But the justices, in a victory for the Scientologists, also upheld a ruling that permits judges to prevent information sought by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from being turned over to other government agencies. The vote on that issue was 4-4. But the breakdown _ in line with <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> tradition on tie votes _ was not disclosed. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> did not take part in the case. The government, which has had numerous legal battles with the Scientologists, began an investigation in 1984 of the tax returns of the church's founder, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>. He died on Jan. 24, 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said it suspected that millions of dollars in church funds were transferred to <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> in the late 1970s and early 1980s in a scheme to protect the church's tax-exempt status and avoid paying taxes on the money. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> issued a summons in October 1984 for 13 confidential documents held by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state court in connection with a private lawsuit involving the church. A federal judge ruled that five of the documents should be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> but only on condition the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> not disclose the contents to any other government agency except in connection with a criminal tax prosecution. That part of the judge's ruling was upheld by today's tie <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> vote. The judge also blocked the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> from obtaining the other eight documents, particularly taped conversations of confidential lawyer-client communications. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld all of the judge's ruling in 1986. The appeals court said the government is not entitled to see attorney-client communications unless it can produce independent evidence that the lawyer is taking part in a fraud. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today unanimously overruled the appeals court on that point. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the lawyer-client tapes may be examined by the trial judge in the privacy of his office to determine whether there is evidence of fraud. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Zolin </PERSON>, 88-40.

<HEAD>Government Bans South Koreans from Attending North Korean Festival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities on Wednesday refused to allow 40 <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> youths and newspaper reporters to attend a festival in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, saying their participation would harm national interests. The refusal confirmed an earlier ban on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> taking part in the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students scheduled July 1-8. `` The <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> gathering is not in conformity with the government's basic unification policy and is detrimental to our national interest,'' National Unification Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hong-koo </PERSON> told reporters. He added, however, that <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> will continue to encourage contacts with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that do not harm South Korean interests. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said senior government officials turned down the requests from 40 Christian youths and journalists. The decision came after authorities denied entry visas to three festival delegates who wanted to travel to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Delegates from <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> were refused entry visas by the South Korean consulate in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and were not allowed to board a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> plane, delegation leader <PERSON> Theo </PERSON> <PERSON> Celens </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Celens, a Belgian representing the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION>, said his delegation wanted to urge <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to let <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> join the festival. `` Our intention was to have a neutral contact,'' he said, adding the festival committee did not want only radical South Koreans, but `` a balanced delegation.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has invited about 500 South Korean students and dissidents to join in the sports, cultural and political event attended mainly by students from Third World and communist nations. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> of using the festival to dramatize its demand for the withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. The festival's organizing committee said Wednesday the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> could attend as observers if their government was concerned about the festival's political nature, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We have given assurances that we would not do anything that may impose a political burden on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> youth and students participating in the festival and that we had no intention to use them politically,'' it quoted the committee as saying.

 A judge temporarily restored driving privileges today to a teen-age father-to-be whose license was revoked because he dropped out of school. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> set aside <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON>' license revocation for 30 days while lawyers file briefs and the judge makes a decision. Means, 17, who dropped out in ninth grade last year, is appealing the loss of his license May 30 under a first-of-its-kind law aimed at curbing truancy in a state where the dropout rate is around 17 percent. Under the law passed last summer, students under 18 who miss more than 10 consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences lose their driving privileges. Means, whose 16-year-old wife, <PERSON> Tonya </PERSON>, is expecting their first child this fall, sued on June 8, the first time the law has been challenged in court. His father said the teen-ager can not support his growing family without a license. The law allows school boards to grant hardship exceptions, but state officials maintain that the teen-ager could hold a job and still complete his education. Educators have praised the legislation, saying its brings teen-agers back to school, but Means' lawyer, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Butch </PERSON>, has argued that it conflicts with another law allowing students to drop out at 16. He called the law ridiculous. `` It says you're poor, you dropped out of high school, and now we're going to punish you some more,'' <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> said. Several states, including <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> signed a dropout bill into law Friday, have similar laws. The judge today <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> said Means keep his driving privileges if he enrolls in a high school equivalency course and makes satisfactory progress. `` I think they're trying to force me to go into a GED program and I do n't like being forced to do anything,'' Means said after the hearing.

 The nation's mayors today adopted a statement deploring recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that they say weaken affirmative action. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> also called for higher federal taxes and a ban on possession of semi-automatic weapons. Before wrapping up their annual conference, the mayors also settled an unprecedented contested race for the conference's future leadership, choosing Democrat <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> over Republican <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>. The mayors overwhelmingly voted down an effort by some <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> mayors to soften the language of their resolution on anti-discrimination in employment. Mayor <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, argued that whites have been victims of discrimination through efforts aimed at encouraging minority employment. But the mayors sided with Republican <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, who argued that without affirmative action, `` the good ol' boy network'' will favor whites. The mayors said recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions are `` making it more difficult to ensure equal opportunities in employment for all Americans.'' Among the other statements, the mayors called for higher federal taxes to cut the deficit and allow more urban aid, and urged a ban on possession of military-type semi-automatic assault weapons. The five-day meeting of mayors from around the nation neared an end one day after the session erupted into partisan name-calling, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> launching a bitter tirade against the Republican national chairman. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> was elected chairman of the organization's advisory committee, an unglamorous title but a job that puts him in line to be president of the conference in 1991. The vote was cast largely along party lines, 67-35, although <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, a Democrat and incoming president of the group, sided with the Republican. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the issue was whether the mayors wanted an outspoken critic of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who would challenge Republican policies. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has said she is optimistic about the new administration. `` I do n't think this is time for mayors to sit back and just go along, to say everything's all right in our cities. Everything is not all right in our cities,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. The contest for advisory committee chairman was thrown to the full conference when two Democrats sided with the Republicans and deadlocked a nominating committee that for 57 years has settled such matters in private. The meeting, where partisanship is often submerged in discussions of common urban needs, saw party bickering flare when <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> national chairman, spoke Monday. Even some Republicans complained about his blunt partisan speech, including <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s statement that he was targeting <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s re-election race Arriving Tuesday, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as `` amoral'' and a `` pathological'' liar. He said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> bore responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> memo that attacked <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> with homosexual innuendo and had lied in denying it. `` He may be the best hired gun in the world, but he carries with him all of the things that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> hates, which is low-level, disgusting tactics ... vile things,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who previously called for <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s resignation, also addressed the group Tuesday and laced his speech with blasts at <LOCATION> Atwater </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> accused his Republican counterpart of having `` taken politics to the lowest level of my lifetime.'' `` Thanks to the Lee Atwaters of the world, national politics is looking more and more like the coastline of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Make no mistake, they want the political oil spill of negative campaigning to spread across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said, `` We assume <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has said all these things because he's in a heated race for mayor.'' She had no comment on <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s remarks. The partisanship, combined with the unusual leadership race, dominated discussions among the mayors. <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Republican Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON>, who on Tuesday had said he was `` embarrassed and disappointed'' by <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s remarks, criticized <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` I just think politicizing the meeting is wrong, and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> was as guilty as <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was,'' <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON> said. He noted that many mayors are elected in races where no party affiliation is listed, and said the conference should n't invite national party chairmen again. `` We work very hard not to be partisan in this organization,'' added <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON>, who was working to avoid a party-line vote in his own race since Democratic mayors outnumber Republicans. The race was for the job of chairman of the conference's advisory committee. It carries an unglamorous title, but the job is third on the group's leadership ladder and means the winner will be scheduled to assume the post of president of the conference _ and leading spokesman for the nation's mayors _ in 1991. The race had partisan dimensions because a victory by <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON> would mean the conference would have two consecutive Republican leaders for the first time ever. Republican Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, has the job and is scheduled to be president in 1990, following Democrat <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, who was to assume the presidency today after a year as vice president. The mayors were ending their meeting having barely mentioned the scandals involving the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which is beset by allegations of influence peddling and disclosures of embezzlement. `` We ca n't let the Republicans turn housing programs for the poor into subsidy programs for wealthy Republican consultants,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in one of the few public airings of the issue this week.

<HEAD>4 Arrested in Baby-Selling Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four people, including a father-daughter team of lawyers, ran a baby-selling scheme that bilked 100 couples of $ 500,000, authorities charged. Only 50 couples got babies, state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said Tuesday. Some others who had paid up to $ 16,000 got neither a child nor a refund after being told the mother miscarried or changed her mind, he said. Authorities said the brokers actually were selling the babies to the highest bidder, doing business in such places as the parking lot of an International House of Pancakes. The mothers, mostly unwed teen-agers from rural areas, were lured through ads in The Star, a supermarket tabloid, and offered help with adoption, counseling, free medical care and financial support. The adoptive couples were middle-class people from urban areas in 21 states and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenichel </PERSON> and his daughter, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenichel </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, both lawyers, and <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON>, all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, were indicted on 144 counts. The four pleaded innocent Tuesday to charges of grand larceny, conspiracy, fraud, perjury, filing false documents and making false statements by illegally operating <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, a private adoption agency. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said neither the mothers who gave up their children nor the adoptive parents face charges. Officials also said it was unlikely the mothers would try to get the children back. Partly because the four defendants used a legitimate social worker to process the adoption cases through the courts, the attorney general said he felt the children were in good hands and the adoptions were not reversible. The Lauers' attorney, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, said, `` Our clients' involvement with adoption agencies have sprung from their own experiences in overcoming great obstacles in obtaining their own children in adoption `` Their actions were always generated from good intentions and to help others who had the same problems they had,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON> wrote an article for Good Housekeeping magazine in 1979 about getting her younger daughter through a classified ad. <PERSON> Fenichel </PERSON> was released on $ 100,000 bail, his daughter on $ 2,500. The Lauers were released and given two weeks to raise $ 10,000 bail. The most serious charge carries a maximum of seven years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine or double the amount illegally gained. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said he would seek restitution for the couples.

<TEXT>
 The government today said the 15-week-old guerrilla siege of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> had ended with a government victory and that troops were pushing the insurgents toward <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Guerrilla leaders denied that the bloodiest battle in the decade-long war was over. There was no way to independently verify either claim. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Nangahar </LOCATION> province and once the country's fifth-largest city, came under rocket and artillery bombardment March 7, three weeks after Soviet troops left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and ended their nine-year intervention. `` We have conquered <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> from the opponents,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, quoting the province's military commander, Gen. <PERSON> Asif </PERSON> <PERSON> Delawar </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the insurgents are based, guerrilla spokesman <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser-Zia </PERSON> of the moderate <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> said of the government claim, `` It's certainly not true.'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON>, a spokesman for the more fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, added: `` The siege is not over. But if they're talking about opening part of the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> highway, that may be true. He also spoke from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. He was referring to the battles for control of the key supply route between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital. Government forces have succeeded in pushing through any number of supply and weapons convoys, but the guerrillas have periodically regained control and sealed off the road. An editor for the Afghan News Agency, an organ of hard-line guerrilla leader <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, called the report `` propaganda.'' He did not want to be quoted by name. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said government forces had pushed the guerrillas about 15 miles east. `` The government's mopping up operations are still continuing. Every day we are able to destroy deserted rebel posts, bunkers and their other hideouts,'' he said. `` Day by day, the number of attacks on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is decreasing rapidly,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` More and more people are coming to their fields to work. This is a definite sign that things are getting better and normal there.'' However, he added, government troops still need time to clear the area. `` There may still exist isolated rebel positions on the outskirts of the city,'' he said. `` Our military aim is to push the rebels further toward the frontier, and we are succeeding.'' <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which had a population of 64,600, is 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. When the siege began, guerrilla leaders predicted the city would fall in three days, giving them a base for an interim government and paving the way for the final drive to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The rebels captured several key outposts in the early fighting. But they failed to unite into a cohesive force capable of mounting a sustained attack. The guerrillas have been fighting to topple the Soviet-backed government since it seized power in an April 1978 coup. More than 1.3 million Afghans have died in the fighting. Also today, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should send a representative to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to negotiate the release of a captured <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> photographer. The government initially did not name the photographer, identifying him only as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journalist. Rebel sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> identified him as <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a freelancer from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, on an assignment for <ORGANIZATION> Time-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The government later acknowledged today on state-run Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that it was <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> who was being held. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was captured June 8 on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Rebel sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, however, claimed the arrest was made June 14. It was not possible to clarify the discrepency. The government accused the photographer of illegally entering the country without a visa and being in company of armed guerrillas. At least three Western journalists and two foreign aid workers have been captured while traveling with rebels during the war. All were released unharmed. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> is the first American captured.

 Suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> violated an anti-discrimination law when its <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> blocked construction of a home for mentally retarded adults, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> alleges in a lawsuit. It is the first lawsuit brought by the department alleging housing discrimination against the handicapped under the Fair Housing Amendments Act that took effect March 12, the agency said in a news release. At issue is a May 1 vote by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the southern suburb of 32,000 people, denying a special-use permit for construction of a home for 15 mentally retarded adults in a neighborhood of single-family and two-family homes, the department said. The complaint, filed Tuesday in federal court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, contends the council denied the request because of neighbors' opposition `` based on fears and prejudices,'' the statement said `` Under the new Fair Housing act, stereotypes and baseless fears concerning the handicapped can not be used to block the development of group homes,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, acting assistant attorney general in charge of of the Civil Rights Division, in the statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Studies have shown that these facilities are better for residents than the out-of-sight, out-of-mind institutions of the past, and that they have no adverse effects on the neighborhood,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Creswell </PERSON>, corporation counsel for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gliottoni </PERSON>, one of the five council members, would not comment on the merits of the case because of the lawsuit. But he said the council followed the lead of the city's zoning board and its plan commission in the decision. `` They are the sounding boards,'' <PERSON> Gliottoni </PERSON> said of the two panels. `` They listen to all the people who are for it and all the people who are against it. We as council members have no input whatsoever.'' He said both groups denied zoning approval, and the Council followed those recommendations, as it does more than 99 percent of the time. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement said the building permit was sought by <ORGANIZATION> RFMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Galesburg </LOCATION> company that specializes in developing homes for the retarded. There was no answer at a telephone number listed for RFMS.

<HEAD>Court Eases Way for Railroad to Sell Off Lines Without Labor Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, by a 5-4 vote, today gave railroads greater leeway to sell off rail lines without first entering into collective bargaining about a sale's effects. The court, resolving one of the most critical issues facing the nation's railroad industry, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, or P & amp; LE, may sell its 182 miles of rail line in eastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> without first negotiating with its employees' unions. Interpreting the Railway Labor Act, a federal law governing the railroad and airline industries, the court said the P & amp; LE was not obligated to bargain over the effects of the sale, including lost jobs. The P & amp; LE, having lost $ 60 million in the five previous years, announced in 1987 that it had agreed to sell its trackage and other assets for about $ 70 million to a newly formed subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pullman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The subsidary intended to operate the railroad as the P & amp; LE had, except that it would not assume the <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> LE </ORGANIZATION>'s union contracts and would lay off about 500 of the railroad's 750 employees. When the unions were notified of the sale, they challenged it as a violation of the Railway Labor Act. The <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, however, approved the sale. A federal trial judge and the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; LE was legally obligated to negotiate with its unions about the sale's effects on the workforce. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the lower courts were wrong. After the sale was postponed, the <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> LE </PERSON> sought a new purchaser. Today's decision also makes that pursuit easier. Writing for the high court, Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the P & amp; LE was not obligated to postpone its sale of the trackage `` beyond the time the sale was approved by the commission and was scheduled to be consummated.'' He added: `` To the extent that the unions' demands could be satisfied only by the assent of the buyers, they sought to change or dictate the terms of the sale, and in effect challenged the decision to sell itself. `` At that time, P & amp; LE was under no obligation to bargain about the terms it had already negotiated,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote. White was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> dissented. But by a unanimous vote the court left unresolved _ and sent back to the 3rd Circuit court for further study _ the related issue of what authority federal courts have to block strikes in such cases. The cases are <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Erie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1859, and <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; LE vs. RLEA, 87-1888.

 Two of six black candidates won judgeships in elections ordered by a judge who said <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s judicial districts discriminated against blacks. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> now has five blacks among its 78 judges, a gain of one after Tuesday's elections. One incumbent lost. `` In spite of some black leaders' allegations that there is no more discrimination in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, these election results are clear indication that discrimination is alive and well in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and will probably be around for some time to come,'' said attorney <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> was one of the lawyers who represented blacks in a 1986 federal lawsuit that resulted in the redrawing of judicial districts in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` Voting patterns along racial lines, if it has been changing, it's becoming more pronounced,'' he said. `` It just shows that we have a lot more work to do.'' Mississippians on Tuesday also finally removed from the state constitution an unenforcable poll tax that was enacted years ago to keep blacks from voting but was struck down by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1966. With 98 percent of the vote in, unofficial returns had 99,648 voting for repeal of the tax and 72,844 against repeal. The state's four black judges are <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, Circuit Judges <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmon-Sanders </PERSON> and Chancery Judge <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. Each was appointed to fill a vacancy, but <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> went on to win a full eight-year term in 1986; he was not up for election Tuesday. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> did not seek election, Banks was unopposed and <PERSON> Blackmon-Sanders </PERSON> was challenged. <PERSON> Blackmon-Sanders </PERSON> lost to Republican challenger <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 12,878 votes to 9,600. One other black Democrat, <PERSON> Isadore </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, was unopposed in the general election. The two black winners in contested races were <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, a Democrat, who defeated Republican <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> for an open <LOCATION> Hinds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chancery judge's post, 5,942 votes to 1,638; and <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweet </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, also a Democrat, who defeated Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> in another open family court post, 4,628 votes to 1,259. Black candidates <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clell </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> all lost to incumbents. `` I am disappointed with the situation as it now exists outside of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' said former state Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirksey </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that resulted in the redistricting. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is the county seat of <LOCATION> Hinds </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and the state capital. <PERSON> Kirksey </PERSON> said the voting vindicated his complaints about the redrawing of some of the districts. He also said there was n't enough time to persuade black voters to cast ballots only for black candidates. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ruled in 1987 that <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s judicial districts discriminated against blacks. The ruling, the first to apply the 1965 Voting Rights Act to judicial elections, was upheld on appeal. <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> ordered some districts redrawn to create minority subdistricts so that black voters would have a better opportunity to elect black judges. Sixteen elections were contested Tuesday. Those elected will take office on July 3.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today refused to accept a guilty plea from a company indicted for water pollution, demanding <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> send its `` top man'' rather than the three executives it flew in from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The case involved a 1985 spill into <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>'s Hylebos Waterway in which at least 75,000 gallons of a cancer-causing chemical escaped from a ruptured 180,000-gallon storage tank that had been poorly maintained. An undetermined amount of the chemical reached the waterway in an overflow last year. In a plea bargain, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay $ 1.1 million for the spills. `` Before I accept this plan the top officer of your company will be here. Not a division; the top man,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON>. In addition to <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> sent a senior vice president for legal matters and president of the company's inorganic chemical division. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> had told attorneys in May that he would not accept the plea unless a <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> executive was present, but he did n't specify which executive. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> told the judge that he was satisfied that <PERSON> Schwartzberg </PERSON> and another of the executives `` are very high in this company and should be able to answer any questions the court has.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> argued it was very unusual to compel executives to appear in such cases. Usually, a company pleads through its attorneys. `` People in this company have had deterrence imprinted on their memory through this investigation,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` There will be deterrence here, your honor.'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, however, cited statistics indicating <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ranks second in the country in the number of such reported pollution violations. `` Apparently deterrence is not being very effective,'' he said. The judge rescheduled the plea hearing for July 19.

<TEXT>
 The photograph of German women staring longingly at a pile of sausages in a store window captures the essence of the aerial foodline provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allies </ORGANIZATION> 40 years ago in defiance of the Soviet blockade of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The photo belongs to an exhibit that opened Wednesday at the Air and Space Museum to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airlift </LOCATION>, mounted at the height of the Cold War by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` The airlift guaranteed the liberty and survival of the free part of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' said West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, who opened the exhibit. Known by welcoming Berliners as the `` Raisin Bombers,'' the planes of the airlift kept alive the Western occupied sectors of the city during a 15-month siege directed by Soviet leader <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. More than 277,000 flights carried 2.3 million tons of supplies to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by Sept. 30, 1949, when the Soviets gave up and reopened roads, rails and waterways. Some 78 aircrew members were killed in crashes and other incidents. While the airlift kept the city going, rations were meager. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimener </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain who spoke at the opening of the exhibit, said he was astonished to learn that each family got only 25 pounds of coal for the winter. <PERSON> Kimener </PERSON>, a pilot in a small naval air contingent that flew in the airlift, said he visited a family in January 1949 whose <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> apartment seemed colder inside than the winter weather outside, even though he wore his flight jacket. The average daily ration of food consisted of 35.2 ounces, including 1.5 ounces of meat. `` We blockaded Berliners are n't starving, but we're always hungry,'' an unidentified survivor is quoted as saying in the catalogue which describes the 60 photographs and airplane models shown in the exhibit. Heroes of the airlift, known affectionately by air crews as `` Operation Vittles,'' include the so-called `` Chocolate Pilot,'' an American who dropped chocolates in handkerchief parachutes to children of the blockaded city in Christmas 1948. Soviet forces, acting on a plan of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> to force the Western Allies out of the city, halted all ground transportation into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on June 24, 1948, and cut off Berliners from food, fuel and other supplies. Within two days <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces started an airlift that grew to a nonstop series of cargo-plane takeoffs and landings every 90 seconds at <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s three airports. One photograph shows <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s so-called `` rubble women'' hauling debris from World War II destruction to build makeshift runways and increase available landing strips. The supplies, including coal, milk and other rations, moved though narrow air corridors from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over the Soviet-occupied East Zone that has become communist-controlled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. So tight were the flying schedules that planes failing to find their landing strip immediately had to return to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> fully laden and try again later. Included in the exhibit are cartons and cans of shortening, coffee and powdered hot chocolate, some marked as gifts from the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Former pilot <PERSON> Kimener </PERSON> said air crews were in competion to carry the most cargo and make the most flights. `` Fatigue was our constant companion,'' said <PERSON> Kimener </PERSON>, who recounted that a Soviet plane once shot at his aircraft and that Soviet decoy beacons lured at least one American plane to destruction.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> serviceman who once had been described as a model soldier pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges he gave defense secrets to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Spec. 4 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> changed his earlier plea of innocent just as his court-martial began, said <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, could be sentenced to life in prison on the espionage charge. The charges were filed against <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> after he disappeared from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION> in February. At the time, military officials said they were baffled because <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had a reputation as model soldier and at one point had been recommended for a `` Soldier of the Month'' award for his superior performance. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> returned voluntarily 11 days later. He was charged on March 16 with espionage. Officials said he had given communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> secrets on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans for the defense of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, dressed in a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> uniform, walked with his head bowed into the <ORGANIZATION> Fulda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> where the court-martial began. He was not handcuffed but was escorted by military police. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said military officials had not expected <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> to change his plea. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to charges of being absent without leave and entering a restricted area near the East German border without permission. The prosecution agreed to drop charges of larceny against <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> after he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of `` wrongful appropriation'' of a portable computer and a military vehicle he used during his absence, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since March 1988, had worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist. After his return, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials said the East Germans themselves notified <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> authorities that <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had made contact with them. The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s home unit, comes under control of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 5th Corps. The cavalry unit is responsible for front-line defense along <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The court-martial judge, Col. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, ordered the public out of the courtroom while specifics of the secret information <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> allegedly gave to the East Germans were discussed. A board of military officers will be selected Thursday to hear testimony that will help determine the length of <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s sentence. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> had been kept in investigative custody at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s confinement facility in Mannheim before the court-martial He now is being held in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>.

 Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Wednesday to step up economic pressure on the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government and announced plans to assemble in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month to write a constitution for a free <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The only language the Chinese government can listen to is economic sanctions,'' said <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueliang </PERSON>, 36, a sociologist and graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference at Constitution Hall, <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> and a dozen other Chinese student organizers unveiled the formation of an umbrella group, the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriots </ORGANIZATION>, to represent their pro-democracy colleagues in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They also disclosed new tactics to get news into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of the government's brutal crackdown on the movement. The information effort, according to <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Ya </PERSON> <PERSON> Qin </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, will include random mailings from cities around the world and the transmission of newspaper and magazine photos and articles to 1,000 fax receivers throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The students also intend to begin publishing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> their own bi-monthly magazine, called <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Archives. As for the argument that a suspension of trade and development assistance would only weaken Western influence and deprive the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people, <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> asked: `` How can you imagine that a government which kills its own people would use foreign currency to benefit its people?'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> froze <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the wake of the bloody June 4 attack against student demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and elsewhere, and on Tuesday he took steps to block at least $ 1.4 billion worth of international development loans. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> still retains most-favored-nation trade status with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, however, and calls have escalated in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for him to take sterner measures. Speaking just hours after <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> authorities executed three protestors, <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> and his colleagues said thousands of Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already have signed a declaration of principles calling for a constitutional convention in exile. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said recently there are 73,000 Chinese with active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> student visas. <PERSON> Ye </PERSON> <PERSON> Ning </PERSON>, a student at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said `` a constitutional convention can be the banner of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people in their fight for freedom ... the government is now trying to put the genie back into the bottle, and it will find that very difficult.'' No date has been fixed for the gathering, to be attended principally by Chinese law students, but it will occur sometime next month, said <PERSON> Ding </PERSON>. `` We've received strong moral support from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and legal scholars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We believe in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ we have learned from your Constitution.'' The declaration circulated by the group says: `` As the world watches, we, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people, are today engaged in an epic struggle to cast off the chains that have bound us for two generations. The present system has been tried in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and has failed. It has produced hunger where there should be plenty, corruption where there should be integrity, servitude where there should be freedom.'' It listed these `` principles that guide our struggle for freedom'': `` 1. Every individual is born with equal and inalienable human rights. 2. The basic right of every individual is the right to be free, the right to plan and live his or her own life. This right entails all other rights, including the rights of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, property, and privacy. 3. To secure these rights, individuals create government, to which they give only as much power as is necessary to secure their rights. 4. A government is legitimate only if it rests on the consent of the governed. 5. The people retain the right to deny legitimacy to their government by withdrawing their consent.''

<HEAD>Coalition Talks Begin; Officials Named in Bribery Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A right-wing party and communist-dominated alliance on Wednesday discussed forming a coalition government aimed at cleaning up alleged corruption under the rule of defeated Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>. The consultations began as judicial investigators named two of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers in a bribery inquiry and asked <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to lift immunity so that they can be prosecuted. The two ministers named are former Deputy Premier <PERSON> Agamemnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON> and Public Order Minister <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Petsos </PERSON>. At the same time, <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Aliki </PERSON>, was among three people charged with involvement in the alleged payment of a $ 2 million bribe to <LOCATION> Koutsogiorgas </LOCATION>. The reports of bribery and corruption involving leaders in <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led to its defeat in Sunday's parliamentary election. Conservative leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, the leader of a communist-dominated alliance, said the prosecution of those involved in the scandals dominated their talks. `` We remained absolutely agreed on one thing, the issue of catharsis and the scandals must not be written off,'' said <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, whose alliance holds a decisive hand in forming a coalition government. `` The dominant issue now is catharsis and political developments must be oriented toward this objective,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said. Latest election results announced Wednesday gave <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 145 seats in the 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, six seats short of the required majority. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, who has led <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since 1981, won 125 seats. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>' alliance took 29 seats. The post-election posturing has taken on new significance in the light of the corruption inquiry. Under the Greek Constitution, only the present or subsequent <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has the power to lift the ministers' parliamentary immunity and prosecute them. If no new government is formed and a new election is called, those elected parliamentarians would be unable to prosecute them. Mrs. <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON> was charged with opening a joint Swiss bank account with her husband where a bribe was deposited. The indictment said the $ 2 million was a bribe to <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON>, who was also Justice Minister, for approving a banking law that helped hide irregularities in the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>. Also charged were bank owner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kosotos </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> Yannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mantzouranis </PERSON>, who also was the secretary of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s council of ministers, was charged with arranging the bribe, and with keeping an unspecified amount of the $ 2 million. <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> was charged with embezzling the $ 2 million and with bribing <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON>. He is in prison in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> awaiting the hearing of an extradition demand by the Greek government. No date was announced for a judicial hearing against those charged. In the parliamentary request, the magistrates accused Koutsogiorgas of accepting bribes while in office and <PERSON> Petsos </PERSON> with accepting gifts. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Yannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alevras </PERSON> said the evidence against the two ministers would be kept secret until its presentation to the first session of the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled for July 3. Consultations to form a coalition government are expected to continue until next week. Each of the three party leaders is given given three days to try to accomplish this, with <PERSON> Mistotakis </PERSON> having the first go.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> pilot killed during an emergency landing after he blacked out would have been grounded if officials had known he had high blood pressure, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> report says. First Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> had lied to flight surgeons, concealing his medical problems for years, so he could fly F-4E Phantom fighters assigned to the 122nd Tactical Fighter Wing at <LOCATION> Baer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, said the report released Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Had the military medical staff been aware of the extent of <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>'s civilian medical problems, he could never have been medically qualified for flying duty,'' investigators said. Medical report forms indicate <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> hid his blood pressure problems from military doctors even though he had been a patient at the <ORGANIZATION> Hypertension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> fainted after shoveling snow Dec. 27, 1988, and his doctor advised him to tell a flight surgeon about the blackouts, the report said. Adj. Gen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elrod </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has ordered flight surgeons to review the medical records of all flying personnel. <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, blacked out about 10 minutes after declaring an emergency and smoke in the cockpit during a Feb. 10 night training flight. He was about eight miles from the runway when he lost consciousness. Maj. <PERSON> Wilburt </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, 39, the weapons systems officer, took control from the jet's rear seat and landed. However, the plane swerved off the runway, damaging the nose gear and activating an automatic ejection system. An autopsy by <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Shaughnessy </PERSON> found <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> suffered a broken neck, back and legs and internal bleeding, all of which were enough to kill him. The autopsy showed no signs of smoke inhalation. `` We do n't know why he passed out,'' said Chief Deputy Coroner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>. `` He was ejected, and then that's when he suffered the injuries, naturally.'' <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>, who stressed he is not a doctor, said <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> could have passed out for any number of reasons. `` There's so many things that could have caused that. Something wrong with the plane, the oxygen in the plane ... but certainly the high blood pressure may have been a factor,'' he said. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, who also was ejected, suffered minor injuries. The report concluded the emergency <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> reported involved a hydraulic problem that corrected itself before he blacked out. The cause of the cockpit smoke was not given.

<TEXT>
 Two of every five <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women giving birth to their first children were n't married when they became pregnant, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday, a rise over the past two decades. The bureau also found a jump in the birth rate among women in their 30s, noted that a majority of the women having a baby in the year ending in June 1988 were in the work force, and said minorities tend to have higher birth rates. In all, the bureau said the national fertility rate was 69.7 births per 1,000 women aged 18 to 44 in that year. Those are considered the prime childbearing ages. Fertility rates have remained at about 70 births per 1,000 women during this decade and the figure for 1988 is not considered significantly different from the 71 recorded the year before. But changes have occurred among the women becoming mothers in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. For women aged 15 to 29, the bureau found, 40 percent of their first-born children from 1985 to 1988 were conceived out of marriage, up from just over 30 percent when the measure was first taken from 1970 to 1974. The 40 percent of new mothers who conceived out of wedlock included 11.7 percent who got married before the child was born and 28.3 percent who were still unmarried when the baby arrived. The major change was among that second group, the women who were still unmarried when the baby arrived. They increased from 17.9 percent of all first-time mothers in the early 1970s to the 28.3 percent recorded in 1985 to 1988. This shift `` may reflect the opinion of some women that they may be better off in the long run by relying more on the support of their parents and relatives for financial and emotional assistance than by entering a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solely to prevent an out-of-wedlock birth,'' bureau analyst <PERSON> Amara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachu </PERSON> said in the report. At the same time that the share of unwed-mothers was rising, the percentage of women conceiving while single and then getting married before the arrival of the baby dropped from 14.9 percent to 11.7 percent of first mothers. The share of unwed first mothers varied sharply by race, the study also found. Among black women 74.6 percent of first births to women aged 15 to 29 occurred out of wedlock from 1985 to 1988, up from 54.1 percent for 1970 to 1974. For Hispanic women, the rate was 30.6 percent, up from 26.7 percent earlier. And white women had 19.6 percent out-of-wedlock births, up from 11.5 percent. The new report also confirmed the widely reported trend of women postponing births as they pursue education and careers. The `` increases in childbearing among women over 30 ... suggest that childless women now more than in the past are deliberately postponing their childbearing to older ages,'' the report said. For women aged 30 to 34, the 1988 fertility rate was 81.6 births per 1,000 women, up from 60 in 1980 and 56.4 in 1976. A similar, though smaller, increase was reported for women 35 to 39. The bureau also asked women about their plans for families and noted that, among childless wives aged 25 to 29, 85 percent still expect to have a child at some point. That's up from 75 percent who expected a future birth in this age group in 1975. Still, the study concluded, `` the question remains: How strong is the commitment to childbearing after remaining married and childless for several years?'' For women aged 18 to 44, the study reported that 50.9 percent of women giving birth in 1988 were in the work force, up from 50.8 percent a year earlier and just 38 percent in 1980. `` Labor force participation among women with newborn children is appreciably higher for college-educated women that for women'' with less education, the report found. Among new mothers with college degrees nearly 60 percent were in the labor force, compared with 49 percent of high school grads and 34 percent who had not finished high school. By race, 59 percent of black mothers were in the labor force, compared with 50 percent of whites and 37 percent among Hispanics.

<HEAD>Fed Sees `Ebbing Expansion'in Some Regions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's economy continues to grow, but there are `` ebbing rates of expansion'' in some regions, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a report that suggests the central bank need not push up interest rates. The survey of economic conditions around the country indicated that growth is slowing and inflationary pressures have eased in response to an anti-inflation campaign launched by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in March 1988. That's what the central bank sought to produce from its 15-month-long effort to curb inflation by pushing up interest rates to cool off the economy. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> eased up slightly and made a small move to loosen its grip on credit in the belief that the slowing economy would help tame price increases. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent during the first five months of 1989, up from price increases of 4.4 percent during 1987 and 1988, but many analysts believe that inflation may begin to level off and decline later this year. The survey, based on comments submitted by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s 12 regional banks, painted a picture of an economy in which slower growth could help ease upward pressure on prices caused by tight labor markets and strained factories. `` Economic activity for most of the nation continues to advance, but a number of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> districts note ebbing rates of expansion,'' the survey said. `` With some exceptions, wage and price pressures are not accelerating. Some districts said their respondents had not been able to pass their input costs increases through to their customers.'' The economic survey, known as the Tan Book, will be used when <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers meet July 5-6 to decide future monetary strategy. The central bank tries to control inflation through its decision on how much money it makes available to the banking system. Economist <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the survey suggests `` the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may have more luck with a soft landing than a lot of people think.'' In a soft landing, growth slows enough to restrain inflation without toppling the country into a recession. `` I would think that they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials -RRB- will pat themselves on the back for a job well done up to this point, but there's nothing in here that tells them they need to loosen aggressively,'' Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> said of the survey. `` It just says expansion is ebbing, which is what the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wants.'' The survey reported that while auto sales have dipped, retail sales generally are positive. Manufacturing growth is leveling off, real estate markets are sluggish, and agriculture is benefiting from recent rains that have helped alleviate drought conditions in some areas, the survey said.

<HEAD>Bomb Found Near Anti-Mafia Judge's Villa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police on Wednesday foiled an apparent attempt to kill <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most celebrated Mafia fighter when they discovered a bomb near his villa, news reports said. Security forces assigned to protect Judge <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> reportedly found 44 pounds of plastic explosives stuffed inside a waterproof bag. The guards, part of a 24-hour security detail, noticed the bag on a sunbathing platform at the edge of the sea, about 20 yards from the villa. The bag was the type used by divers to store their gear. Experts blew up the bomb. The Italian news agencies <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> quoted explosives experts who examined the bomb as saying it was clearly meant to kill the judge or his family, who frequently went for swims in the morning. News agencies said investigators theorized that the potential assassins had set up a surveillance base either in one of the nearby villas or in a boat offshore. They theorized the bomb would have been set off when <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> went down the walk leading to the sea. When the bomb was discovered, <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> was about to leave the villa for a morning workout at a health club. His guards rushed him instead to his heavily guarded office in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>'s Palace of Justice. It was not reported whether other members of his family were home at the time. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>'s investigations of the Mafia have led to hundreds of convictions. He reportedly receives frequent threats, and his security precautions are among the tightest in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. For his summer stay at the villa, guards have been stationed along the road that runs above the villa, and police motor launches periodically patrol offshore. Mafia members who turned informants have reportedly said that <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> is the top target of the organization.

 Firefighters laboring in 100-degree-plus heat today contained a desert wildfire near the grotesquely shaped trees of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> Tree Monument In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, rain helped crews battling a blaze in the dry <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. The 935-acre blaze in the desert raged within 1,000 feet of homes and was the largest of four fires that burned 1,500 acres in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before being contained. A predicted high of 118 degrees, brittle vegetation and capricious winds were expected to keep 375 firefighters on the fire lines all day. One firefighter suffered burns on the face, said state <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>. The fire burned away from the <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON> monument, a rugged area named for the trees with dagger-shaped leaves and branches like upraised arms. The <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON> is common to the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. The fire started Tuesday, prompting authorities to order the evacuation of 85 homes as flames bore down on a neighborhood in the city of <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>. But the fire was stopped short of the houses, and most people had returned by late in the day. `` The residents had cleared the brush around their homes and if it had n't been for that clearance the homes would definitely have burned,'' said <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>. One outbuilding was destroyed in the sparsely populated area 110 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, rain brought firefighters closer to putting out a wildfire that has scorched 43,700 acres of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. Nearly 400 firefighters from at least seven states battled the blaze, which has been fed by wind and dry grass. `` If things work like they're working now, I'd say two to three days,'' information officer <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` If all of a sudden it dries up and we get some crazy winds, it could do something else.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deeply regrets <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s execution of three men in the crackdown on pro-democracy forces, but the administration is not considering additional sanctions against <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said today `` There is an important relationship which we should seek to preserve if we possibly can,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters. `` That is a consideration that must be taken on board when we consider what specific actions'' should be taken. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> spoke with reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as he accompanied visiting West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> to a luncheon. `` We deeply regret the fact that these executions have gone forward, notwithstanding appeals from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, appeals from the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and perhaps other countries, for clemency,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would impose additional sanctions in retaliation for the executions in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, he said: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not contemplating any additional action at this time.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes that sanctions already in place are the proper response to the bloody crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the arrests of more than 1,600 pro-democracy demonstrators. Eight protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also have been condemned to die. Tightening diplomatic and financial pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took steps Tuesday to block at least $ 1.4 billion in development loans while he said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is gripped by an `` atmosphere of suspicion and reprisal.'' Hours after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions were announced, Chinese authorities in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> ignored the international pleas for clemency and shot to death the three men, who had been convicted of setting a train on fire. They were the first reported executions since the crackdown began. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged today that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not been influenced by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or other nations. `` The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and it does not appear to have made much difference,'' he said, adding that `` history has shown that they generally are not that responsive to outside kinds of pleas.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not afford to turn its back on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> even though it deplores what is happening there. `` Everyone has to recognize, first of all, that this is a country of a billion people ... a sizeable portion of the world's population that can not be closeted off and ignored,'' he said. Moreover, he said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plays an important role in regional conflicts, such as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and the Iran-Iraq war, and also is a nuclear power that possesses ballistic missiles. `` It's important that we have some perspective in viewing the overall, longterm relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and that we believe we have tried to strike the right balance,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, at a picture-taking session with the president, was asked his reaction to the executions. `` We are condemning the brutal ...,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> began. His comment was interrupted by a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide who shouted an order that ended the photo session. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no comment. On <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s orders, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will try to postpone consideration of new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by international financial institutions. One administration source said the action could freeze $ 1.4 billion over the next six months from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Other estimates indicated the figure could be even higher. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also curtailed contacts by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials with their Chinese counterparts, ordering a suspension of all high-level exchanges of government officials with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. While not affecting embassy-to-embassy contacts, it will force <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> to scrap a trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> next month, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` This action is being taken in response to the wave of violence and reprisals by the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities against those who have called for democracy,'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hopes that the current tragedy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can be brought to a peaceful end and that dialogue will replace the atmosphere of suspicion and reprisal,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is an important state with which we hope to continue productive relations.'' The latest action follows earlier orders for a freeze on military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and a suspension of contacts by military leaders. With the repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been prodded by conservative and liberal members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> alike to take tougher action, such as withdrawing most-favored-nation trading privileges from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The administration has argued that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is impervious to pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wants to refrain from commercial sanctions that would hurt the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people. Congressional Del. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-D.C. </LOCATION>, said at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee hearing prior to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has $ 4.7 billion in loans `` pending or in the pipeline'' at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1.1 billion being processed by the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The White House statement said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s action was aimed at new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, so it was unclear how much money was involved.

 Eighteen Chinese refugees who arrived in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> by boat have asked for asylum in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> because they are afraid to return to their homeland, officials said Wednesday. Immigration Chief <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Defensor </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> said the 16 men and two women would be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees to determine whether they can be classified as political refugees.

They were brought to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> June 13, Ms. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> said. They apparently left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` because they anticipated that trouble was brewing ... that there was going to be political commotion in the next few months,'' Ms. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> said. `` And at the same time, they left because of a desire to enhance their economic status,'' she added. `` According to the affidavits taken, they do not wish to return to mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. They are afraid that they will be punished or killed by authorities in the mainland. They wish to go to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> because they think that there are better job prospects there.''

 A medicine commonly used to control epilepsy in pregnant women appears to cause minor birth defects and retardation, raising a dilemma about how to prevent seizures that can also harm the unborn, a study concludes. Other epilepsy drugs have already been linked with birth defects. Now researchers say that one called Tegretol or carbamazepine should be added to the list. The drug's manufacturer questioned the way the study was conducted and its conclusion. `` Physicians who treat women with seizures are in a very difficult position,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacro </PERSON>, a co-author of the study. `` This is the drug of choice because it seemed to be safe. We ca n't say that anymore.'' The study found evidence that women who took Tegretol during pregnancy were more likely to produce babies with delayed development and mental retardation. They were also more likely to have unusual facial formations _ including upward slanting eyes, long upper lips and short noses _ and incomplete development of the fingernails. <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION>, the company that makes Tegretol, said the latest study is a reminder that the risks and benefits of anticonvulsant drugs need to be weighed carefully, but that the medicine should still be considered for epileptic women who want to have children. `` We feel that our past data show that Tegretol is a good option for epileptic women. We still feel that way,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernen </PERSON>. The study was directed by Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION>. It was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine Studies have found that severe epileptic seizures during pregnancy can temporarily interrupt the flow of blood to the fetus, causing brain damage. However, epileptic women have an increased risk of producing babies with minor birth defects, even if they do n't have seizures during their pregnancies. `` Counseling has to start before pregnancy for these women,'' said <PERSON> Lacro </PERSON>, a pediatrician at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` If the woman has severe enough seizures and needs the medicine, then by all means you have to give it. But there is no completely safe therapy other than being off medications.'' The researchers first identified the pattern of birth defects in eight children who had been exposed to the drug before birth. They confirmed it by evaluating an additional 48 children whose mothers had taken the medicine. They found that 11 percent of those exposed had facial abnormalities, 26 percent had incomplete finger nails and 20 percent were slow to develop. Only one of the youngsters with delayed development was old enough to take an intelligence test. That child, aged 6, had an IQ of 65. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> criticized the study for `` serious methodological problems.'' It noted that the doctors used women who did not have epilepsy in a comparison group. The higher risk of birth defects among the children of the epileptic women might have resulted from the epilepsy, not the medications, it said. <PERSON> Lacro </PERSON> said, `` I think that what we are seeing is due to the drug. If the changes that we saw were due to seizures alone, then we would see the same pattern of malformations for all kinds of seizure drugs. I think the defects are drug specific, but I ca n't prove that.''

 Nervous about falling under Chinese control, residents of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> are applying for temporary visas to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at an accelerating rate. But most of those wanting to move permanently from the world's third-largest financial trading center are looking to other countries Last year, applications for non-immigrant _ or temporary _ visas to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> averaged 650 a day. Since Chinese troops fired on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square June 3-4, the daily total has risen above 1,000, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. There were no figures available on permanent immigration, but a department official said other countries were preferred because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law restricts entry to aliens with close family ties to Americans, occupations in demand here, or other specific qualifications. Other countries are more lenient. Telephone calls for information to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> have increased, but most <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents are well aware of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rules, the official said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 99-year lease on <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> expires in 1997 under terms worked out with the Chinese in 1984.

<TEXT>
 A young man's suicide in despair over his homosexuality has led to a college scholarship in his memory, and changed his mother's fundamentalist views. The $ 500 scholarship in memory of <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> will be offered beginning next year in <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, site of an acrimonious struggle between fundamentalists and homosexuals. It is intended to encourage and give a sense of caring to gay students facing prejudice and hostility, according to the organization that created the gift. `` What we are saying to gay students is there is a -LRB- gay -RRB- community out there and we care about you,'' said <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Birle </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> teacher and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Costa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Network </LOCATION> of Gay and Lesbian Educators. The scholarship, funded by donations, will be open to heterosexual students, though preference will be given to homosexuals. `` I do n't know why nobody ever thought of this before,'' <PERSON> Birle </PERSON> said. `` There are scholarships for Italians, Catholics, Hispanics and every other kind of minority _ so why not for homosexuals?'' <PERSON> Birle </PERSON> said he could find no similar scholarships around the country, and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said it never heard of one, either. So far, 21 of the county's 23 high schools have agreed to include the scholarship in the list they offer students. Opposition is expected from the Anaheim-based <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homosexual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> group, which for more than a year has actively opposed school programs in <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> that portray homosexuality positively. But the <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> group's activities, and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s death, prompted his mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, to give her blessing when <PERSON> Birle </PERSON> asked if she would support the scholarship. `` I really believed God would come to <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s rescue. And when he did n't, I had to rethink everything,'' she said Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> was initially horrified by her son's homosexuality, which she learned of when he was 16.

She now is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Diablo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.

 Heathrow Airport authorities are withdrawing 180 press passes to improve security in the wake of the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 in December. As of July 31, reporters, photographers and camera crews will be barred from large areas of the airport where they had traditionally been permitted access. <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ltd. </LOCATION>, the airport authority, said access generally will be restricted to essential personnel. `` The reason for the withdrawals is that fewer numbers means fewer people that have to be ... searched, questioned or monitored and greater attention can be focused on those who are airside,'' said airport spokesman <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>. `` It is not a review of media passes but a review of all passes.''

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> suspended new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> two weeks ago after the bloody crackdown on demonstrators by Chinese troops, though the bank is still paying out money on previous loans, a spokesman said Wednesday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised on Tuesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would use its voting power in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and other international lending institutions to try to prevent new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogl </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the bank, said that new loans were suspended on June 8 and all but one of the bank's eight staff members were pulled out of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> although some have returned. <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>, the bank's financial spokesman, estimated that on March 31 about $ 4.4 billion worth of approved loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had not yet been disbursed. Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman, decided on June 8, shortly after the Chinese crackdown, not to submit new loans for final approval to the 22-member Board of Executive Directors, which meets every week in closed-door session, representing 151 member governments. As the biggest shareholder, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has just over 18 percent of the voting power and strong influence over many other members. <PERSON> Shahid </PERSON> <PERSON> Burki </PERSON>, a Pakistani who heads the bank's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> desk, is due back at the bank's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Monday with a report for <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> and the board. `` If economic chaos or some other reason was preventing a loan for irrigation from being properly spent, for example, we would not want to keep putting out the money,'' <PERSON> Vogl </PERSON> said in an interview. The bank lends $ 2 billion to $ 2.5 billion a year to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the third-largest borrower after <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Pastor <PERSON> Sison </PERSON>, spokesman on <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, calculated that $ 780 million worth of new lending for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was due for approval by the board before the bank's fiscal year ends June 30. The bank is planning to lend $ 20 billion to $ 21 billion this year to over 100 Third World countries. The usual rush is on to complete this program by the end of the fiscal year and the board has scheduled three meetings next week. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> said it would be hard to transfer to other borrowers the amounts designated for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the bank's sister organization, said it has no loans pending or being disbursed to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does get loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, an international body with headquarters in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Embarrassed Arkansas Lawmakers Scramble to Avert Fiscal Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Red-faced legislators met in an emergency special session Wednesday to re-pass hundreds of spending bills that were ruled invalid because the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> violated a requirement in the state's constitution. Virtually all state spending will halt July 1, when <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>' fiscal biennium begins, unless the legislators approve nearly 300 appropriations bills all over again `` I am embarrassed,'' veteran state Rep. <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> said of the procedural snafu during the regular session, which ended in April. `` But it is an honest mistake.'' The special session convened late Tuesday, one day after a specially appointed <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the General Appropriation Act did not pass with a three-fourths majority as required by the state's 115-year-old constitution. Since the General Appropriation Act must be passed before any other spending bills may be enacted, the ruling meant the state had not authorized a spending blueprint. `` The fact that our state constitution is an amalgamation of anachronisms is no justification to ignore it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brummett </PERSON> wrote Wednesday. During the regular legislative session, the general appropriation bill got a 65-22 vote in the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and a 25-9 vote in the 35-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where 27 votes equals three-fourths. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and later a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, decided that the general appropriation bill fell under the category of `` just debts,'' which the constitution says is exempt from the three-quarters rule. A Little Rock attorney, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Perroni </PERSON>, then filed a friendly lawsuit challenging the General Appropriation Act's validity. When a <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chancellor rejected the `` just debts'' argument in ruling the appropriation act invalid, the issue went to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. However, the seven justices recused themselves, citing a possible conflict of interest because the legislature appropriates funds for the high court. A special seven-member <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was appointed that also rejected the `` just debts'' argument, so on Monday night, Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>'s staff began rounding up lawmakers to return to <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. The only legislators missing from the special session were a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member who was sick and another who was out of the country. The constitution requires that all special sessions meet for at least three days, and <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said he hoped lawmakers could wrap up things Thursday or Friday. To show his desire for no-nonsense action, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> decided against an opening speech for the session, which is costing taxpayers an estimated $ 20,000 a day. `` I want to do it as quickly as possible, keep it to this agenda and finish,'' the governor said. Once in session, lawmakers hastily assigned bill numbers and gave the familiar items two readings, dispatching them to the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where the panel's co-chairman, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, pressured colleagues to grind out all spending bills in a two-hour sitting. `` Understand, this is a re-hash, the same thing, and all of us know what we have done,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We're showing we're not derelict in our duties.'' `` It's just unfortunate we are not as good constitutional lawyers as the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a lawyer. `` But I know there was a general good faith belief that it was properly passed.'' The court ruling also invalidated an unpopular $ 119 million, 10-year settlement of state liability in desegregation lawsuits surrounding schools in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The settlement passed by a narrow margin the first time around, and opponents say they wo n't let it pass again. Sen. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Russ </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which recommended the settlement bill for passage Wednesday, predicted the bill would pass the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but die in the House.

<HEAD>FBI Calls Violent Crime a Top Priority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is making violent crime a nationwide investigative priority to counter a 40 percent increase in such offenses in the 1980s, Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said Wednesday. Sessions told reporters that violent crime will rank with foreign counterintelligence, terrorism, drugs, organized crime and white collar crime as major priorities of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` With the acknowledged 40 percent increase in violent crime, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public is understandably outraged by the growing disregard for human life by criminals,'' Sessions said. While state and local police still have jurisdiction to investigate the vast majority of violent crimes, Sessions said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can expand its role in this area. For example, recently enacted legislation gives the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> expanded jurisdiction to investigate the killings of all state and local law police officers. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also has new jurisdiction under the drug law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year to investigate murders related to drug trafficking. In the past, violent crime `` did not receive as I believe, the kind of emphasis is should receive,'' Sessions said. The new priority status of violent crimes `` will be certain to get the attention of SACs -LRB- special agents in charge -RRB- out there in the field who are allocating resources to the particular responsibilities,'' Sessions said. The amount of time agents have spent investigating violent crime has dropped `` because of the other priorities that we have established. I anticipate this will hold the line in any reduction in those numbers,'' Sessions said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to appropriate $ 19.5 million to hire 300 new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents as part of his anti-crime package. If approved, `` we expect to apply those resources directly to the violent crime problem,'' Sessions said. Sessions meanwhile, declined to say he was strongly confident that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would find those responsible for the March 10 bombing of a van in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> driven by the wife of the capital of the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>. `` I ca n't express with strong confidence we will solve that particular crime but I hope we will be able to do it,'' Sessions said. The blast did not injure <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the wife of Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, whose ship mistakenly shot down an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last summer. By contrast, <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> said he remained confident that investigators would solve the Dec. 29 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> that killed all 259 persons. The bombing is believed to be in retaliation for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of the Iranian jetliner that was carrying 290 people. Sessions, meanwhile, acknowledged there `` may have been a lapse'' in communications when Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was not notified that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents planned to interview Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., on Memorial Day The Memorial Day visit resulted in stories that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was investigating an allegation of payroll padding on <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s congressional staff The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has since said <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is not a target of the investigation but is cooperating. Last week, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, said that the attorney general should have been informed in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> interview. Sessions said `` it is one of those things'' of which <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> should have been aware. `` To me it's very important that he be aware of those things that are problematic,'' Sessions said. `` We try to have keep him informed,'' Sessions said. `` I have no rationale or excuse to make in that connection.'' But the director said `` I do n't think there was a breakdown in communications, I think there may have been a lapse there may have been some circumstances where communication was not fully conveyed.''

<HEAD>Bush Meets with Lawmakers on Steel Import Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opponents of steel import restraints told President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday that he should not feel bound by a campaign pledge to renew the trade barriers. `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Winston </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> used to say, ` I'd rather be right than be consistent,' and I reminded the president of that,'' Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters after the meeting at the White House regarding the import curbs that expire Sept. 30. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met privately with lawmakers who favor extending the trade program and with <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and others who are urging it be dropped. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` tipped his hand in no direction whatsoever,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration negotiated five-year, product-by-product `` voluntary restraint agreements'' in 1984 with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and other nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Three days before last November's election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote a letter to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., pledging to renew the program in some form But with the steel industry newly profitable, opponents of the curbs say they can make a case for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to end the barriers or at least narrow their scope. `` We'd like to think his normal inclination would be on the side of fewer barriers,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., told reporters after the meeting `` What he's going to do with that statement that he made in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> toward the end of the campaign, I do n't know. But I suppose I could live with a compromise.'' `` Everything is different than it was in 1984,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. `` The industry is operating at 96 percent of capacity, steel prices are rising very rapidly now, especially for the smaller fabricators who do not have long-term agreements with the domestic steel industry. The steel industry is profitable.'' Advocates of continuing the program argue that steel price hikes have been caused not by import barriers but by strong worldwide demand and shifting exchange rates. The trade conditions that spawned the restraint program still exist, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> said. `` America is playing by the right rules and everybody else is playing by protectionism, and we get hurt,'' <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said. He said the program must be extended `` so the steel industry can complete about another $ 10 billion of modernization that they have to complete in order to be competitive with the rest of world, which is already subsidizing and dumping in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The administration has not said when a decision will be made, but <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said he expected something in the next several weeks. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said they attended the meeting on behalf of steel companies and steelworkers pressing for a five-year renewal of the program.

 Israeli warplanes destroyed the headquarters of a dissident Palestinian guerrilla faction Wednesday, and the guerrillas reported one fighter killed and six wounded. Palls of dust and smoke billowed from the oak woods around <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, as guerrillas opened up with anti-aircraft guns on fighter-bombers that dived from clear skies. The jets released scarlet balloons to deflect heat-seeking missiles. Guerrillas launched one SA-7, but the Soviet-made projectile missed its target. Police said four warplanes struck two positions of the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in the bluffs of <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said eight guerrillas were wounded. A statement from the guerrillas' headquarters in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> reported one guerrilla killed and six wounded. It said the raid lasted 105 minutes, during which nine formations of U.S.-built F-4 Phantom and Skyhawk bombers dropped more than 100 rockets. The statement said guerrillas prevented several attempts to land airborne and seaborne commandos in the area, where they maintain bases in a chain of tunnels across the <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> hills. Israeli gunboats were cruising the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and two helicopter gunships hovered over the beaches, but reporters saw no attempt to land troops. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the Israeli army said its planes returned safely from an attack on targets that `` served as the headquarters for <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>.'' It was the third air raid on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this week and the ninth this year. On Friday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes bombed south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> refugee camp, wounding two children. By police count, nine people have been killed and 60 wounded in the eight other air strikes. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>, a former Syrian army captain, is leader of the Libyan-financed faction that has been at odds with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for six years Another guerrilla group, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, said its <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> base was hit, but gave no details of damage or casualties. <PERSON> Habash </PERSON>'s organization, the second-largest of the nine <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, pledged in a statement to `` continue the painful raids against the Zionist enemy.'' The Lebanese spokesman could confirm only the hits on <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s bases He said four of the rockets struck the entrance to a tunnel and 10 others devastated a base near a deserted monastery. A Palestinian guerrilla source said on condition of anonymity that the attack `` inflicted severe damage on the base near the monastery, but the tunnel was not affected.'' The base is only 500 yards east of the highway linking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Panicking motorists deserted their vehicles and ran for cover in banana groves. Swimmers hurried to a nearby motel. But <LOCATION> Naameh </LOCATION> residents, accustomed to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> attacks, climbed to rooftops to watch the planes. Lebanese militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> blocked roads and fired automatic rifles in the air to keep reporters and photographers from stricken targets. The Naameh bluffs were the scene of a nine-hour confrontation between <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON>'s fighters and Israeli air, naval and ground forces Dec. 9. Eight guerrillas and an Israeli officer were killed. <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> said after that battle the helicopter-borne paratroopers released dogs fitted with tear gas containers and explosives to chase his fighters across the tunnels.

<TEXT>
 An ultra-right party that made a strong showing in voting for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is aiming for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, aided by millions of dollars in government campaign funds. The Republicans, headed by a former Waffen SS soldier, have tapped an ultraconservative vein with strong nationalistic appeals and demands to virtually bury the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. The Republicans won 7.1 percent of the vote and six seats in Sunday's balloting for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. It was their first nationwide test. `` The party has automatically improved its chances for the next elections,'' said West German pollster <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibowski </PERSON>. `` Nothing succeeds like success.'' <PERSON> Gibowskia </PERSON>, a director of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Forschungsgruppe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wahlen </ORGANIZATION> polling organization of <LOCATION> Mannheim </LOCATION>, added, `` A party that shows at the first shot it can get more than 5 percent of the vote will no longer be subject to doubts among voters about whether they're wasting their ballot by voting for it.'' Five percent of the vote is the minimum needed for a party to gain seats in the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and many people are predicting the Republicans will succeed during national voting in December 1990. The Republicans will receive $ 8.2 million in campaign funds allotted by the government to various political parties. Founded in 1983, the Republicans came to prominence in city elections in January in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, gaining 7.5 percent of the vote and 11 seats in the city legislature. They ran on a platform to rid the city of foreign workers. Later, the Republicans picked up support in the few races where they fielded candidates in municipal elections in <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, the former SS soldier who heads the Republicans, told thousands of cheering supporters in February that young Germans should be absolved of guilt for the Holocaust. `` Today's young generation of Germans is no more guilty for <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> than the sons and daughters of Americans who committed genocide at <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON>, who claims the party has 16,000 members, has also railed against the Common Market as a threat to West German national interests and made strong law-and-order appeals that reportedly have gained support among police groups. There have been clashes between left-wing demonstrators and police guarding Republican rallies. Some critics accuse the Republicans of having neo-Nazi tendencies. Federal officials have refused to call them right-wing `` extremists,'' which include various neo-Nazi groups. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Jewish community, predicts the Republicans will win 5 percent of the vote next year and sit in Parliament. `` The success of the Republicans is not temporary,'' <PERSON> Galinski </PERSON>, a 76-year-old survivor of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must figure in the future on having a further increase in the radical right-wing.'' Since Sunday's voting for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, one main issue has been whether Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would form a coalition with the Republicans to stay in power following the 1990 voting. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> rejects the idea. <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON> denies he wants to work with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s party but says he has had contacts in that direction from the <ORGANIZATION> Chrisitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s more conservative Bavarian sister party, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're in the happy position of being the courted bride and not the flirtatious bridegroom,'' <PERSON> Schoenhuber </PERSON> said Monday in summing up his view of where the party stands. Republican leaders also have announced they plan to move the party headquarters from <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to increase their profile, while saying they will run in numerous state and local races before the 1990 national voting. Among the leftist politicians worried by the Republicans' high profile is <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, head of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION> state parliament. He blamed <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s party for reviving hopes for the reunification of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, especially during the recent visit of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. That, according to <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, fueled the Republicans' own strident demands for reunification. `` That is an appeal to national feelings that has nothing to do with reality,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. `` That's a chance for the Republicans. They thrive on that hope.'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> has called for a united front involving political parties, churches and labor unions to carry out a campaign to halt the Republicans. He wants to target young people in particular to educate them about the ultra-right.

<HEAD>Sub's Sonar Sub Didn't Spot Tugboat, Investigator Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nuclear submarine that snagged a towing cable and dragged a tugboat under, killing a deckhand, had failed to detect the 97-ton vessel by sonar, a federal investigator says. The analysis by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrell </PERSON> is based on interviews with the crew of the USS <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> after the accident June 14. <PERSON> Tyrell </PERSON>, in an interview in Wednesday's <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Press-Telegram </LOCATION>, said the tug's engine noises may have been masked by the sounds of larger ships in the area, or the sub may have been in a spot where it could n't pick up the tug's sounds. Requests for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> comment were referred to Lt. <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedley </PERSON> at the sub's home port in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and she was n't immediately available. According to <PERSON> Tyrell </PERSON>, the 360-foot sub was relying on `` passive'' sonar, which allows tracking of vessels by engine and other noises. This is normal for military subs, <PERSON> Tyrell </PERSON> said, noting that active sonar, which emits `` pings'' that bounce back and locate vessels more accurately, give away a sub's position. The <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> snagged the submerged cable linking the 73-foot tug to two barges. Two crewmen swam to safety in the early-morning fog, but a deckhand was lost. Shortly before the accident, the sub had helped in filming of the movie `` The Hunt for Red October.''

<HEAD>Prepare New Drive for Wayne Williams in Atlanta Murders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly a decade after the first of the `` child murder'' victims was found, lawyers for <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> are headed back to court to try to show that the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, was responsible for the deaths. From July 1979 to May 1981, 29 poor, generally street-wise young blacks were found killed in and around <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. One other is missing. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, now 30, was convicted in 1982 of two of the deaths and is serving two life sentences. Authorities attributed 22 other killings to him. The other cases remain classified as unsolved. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> civil rights lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuntsler </PERSON> said he and others working on <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' case will meet Tuesday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to organize what he called `` the final thrust'' of their appeal and to request a new evidentiary hearing. `` We've been collecting more and more information, all of which points to <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>'s innocence,'' he said Wednesday from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. The prosecution has contended since <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was convicted that the evidence points to him and to nobody else. But doubt has remained in the minds of many, including the parents of some victims, over whether <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was behind all of the killings or acted alone. The <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> unanimously rejected an initial appeal of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' conviction in 1983 and later voted 6-1 not to reconsider. In November 1985, <PERSON> Kuntsler </PERSON> and others on the defense team appealed in <ORGANIZATION> Butts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is imprisoned, claiming authorities withheld vital information from the defense that might have exonerated the former freelance photographer and music promoter. Since then, the case has remained dormant while defense attorneys sought information to support their contention. `` What we have put together is the fact that there was a meeting in the governor's office in which it was decided that they could not charge a white Klan member without causing a race riot,'' <PERSON> Kuntsler </PERSON> contended. `` <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> became the fall guy. Everything we have sustains that.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Busbee </PERSON> was governor at the time. His secretary said he could not immediately comment Wednesday because he was in meetings. <PERSON> Kuntsler </PERSON> said investigators have amassed more than 300 pages of new evidence that points away from <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have as much as we're going to get,'' he said. `` We're going to reopen this case and get <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> out of there and go after the Klan.'' Among evidence withheld, he contends, are wiretap recordings in which Klan members admit `` that they did it and they boasted about it.'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaton </PERSON>, district attorney for <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where most of the killings took place, said he was aware of `` nothing new'' in the case and added that the move appears to be a continuation of the appeal previously filed. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was convicted largely on the basis of fibers found on the victims that could be traced to the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> household carpet, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' bedspread, his dog and other sources. Prosecution witnesses testified that the odds of random duplication of that combination of fibers were 150 million to one. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Drolet </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office, who prosecuted the case, said fiber evidence linked <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> to about 20 of the cases and the same fiber combination has not been found on a murder victim since <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was arrested. Some victims were found in rivers or on river banks and were washed clean of evidence, he said.

<HEAD>Young Americans Urged to Help Rescue Those ``Free Falling Through
Society''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a clarion call to community service, urged young Americans on Wednesday to help rescue millions of homeless, poor and other needy people who are `` free falling through society.'' `` I need your help. ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs your help,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told more than 3,000 teen-agers and children on the White House lawn. `` It is a time of need for millions of Americans,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Too many people are free falling through society with no prospect of landing on their feet. `` No one _ young, old, white, brown or black _ should be permitted to go through life unclaimed,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You must show us how to reclaim these lives.'' He made his appeal as part of his Youth Engaged in Service -LRB- YES -RRB- to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> drive to muster support for community service. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday, he will unveil details of a wider national service initiative `` to encourage volunteers of all ages, all backgrounds, all abilities,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would urge virtually every institution in society to give a new push to volunteerism. But on this steamy morning, he aimed his message at the young, from 5 to 25, saying all had something to give. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invoked the image of the bell in the church steeple that in `` a simpler time'' summoned neighbors to help. `` When people heard that bell, they did n't stop to ask why it was ringing, they just came, -LRB- on -RRB- horseback or foot, by buggy or bicycle, honking the horn of a Model T, they just came,'' said the president. `` Whatever the problem, whoever was in need of help, they were ready.'' `` The bells have been silent too long,'' he said. `` Let them ring in your hearts and across the land.'' `` Commit yourselves. Listen to the bells. Make it your mission to make a difference in somebody else's life,'' he said. `` All of you have something to offer _ kids from tough neighborhoods, kids from broken homes, kids who have grown up on food stamps and hand-me-downs. ... You each have a gift that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs,'' he said. His remarks hit a receptive chord in the audience, invited from Boy Scout troops, church groups, schools and other organizations already engaged in service. `` He's preaching to the converted in my case,'' said <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who is spending this summer as a volunteer for Common Cause before her junior year at <ORGANIZATION> Haverford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Service `` is part of the Quaker ethos at <LOCATION> Haverford </LOCATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Shaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 12, a Boy Scout from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said, `` I just helped somebody a little while ago. A young lady lost her nametag.'' He helped her find it on the soggy and packed White House lawn. As presidents in time of war called for young people to defend <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was urging them to fight poverty, homelessness and other ills. He told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in February he will seek $ 100 million over four years to endow a YES foundation to provide matching grants for community service projects. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said young people could find meaning and adventure in community service. He listed sad statistics about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youth _ 1,700 drop out of school, 4,000 run away from home and 2,700 become pregnant daily _ but he insisted: `` You're not the problem. You are the solution.'' `` You do n't need to be bribed with incentives and threatened with penalties to get engaged in community service,'' he said. `` Service is its own reward, satisfaction guaranteed.'' `` He wants to save money,'' said <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Shih </PERSON>, 17, of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where the girls are required to perform 40 hours of community service before senior year. `` It's good, the 1,000 points of light and everything,'' said <PERSON> Shih </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteer. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s in the red. He has to find some way to help the less-fortunate without straining the budget.''

 <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s administrator Wednesday refused to dismiss paramilitary policemen who have been accused of intimidating civilians and jeopardizing independence elections in the territory. South African Administrator <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> told a news conference he will allow members of the recently disbanded <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION> counterinsurgency unit to remain in the regular police force. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Koevoet </ORGANIZATION>, which means `` crowbar'' in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION>, wore military uniforms and traveled the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> in armored personnel carriers. They are known for often brutal tactics against supporters and guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought 23 years to end South African rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Koevoet </PERSON> was made up mostly of black Namibians led by white South Africans. <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for 74 years, has agreed to a yearlong transition to independence supervised by more than 4,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors. Both the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> accuse ex-Koevoet members of continuing to harass civilians since their January integration into the regular police force `` Their activities appear to have createad an atmosphere of fear and intimidation among much of the population in the northern region,'' <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> special representative to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, said in a June 9 letter to <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>. `` In my opinion, -LRB- they are -RRB- unfit for continued service in the police during the transition period in view of the need to ensure the necessary conditions for free and fair elecations,'' the letter said. <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> said he has reports guerrillas are storing arms caches in northern <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and he can not afford to reduce the police strength. `` We feel obliged to maintain a state of alertness, commensurate with a potential threat to the security of the region,'' he said. `` I reject the possibility that men should be removed from the police just because they have been members of the counterinsurgency unit.'' He emphasized he would dismiss individuals found guilty of misconduct. <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON> met Wednesday to discuss the intimidation charges and plan more talks, officials said. In other developments, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said 5,621 Namibian exiles have been flown home since they began a repatriation campaign 10 days ago. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has registered more than 41,000 Namibian refugees at camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and wants to bring back 1,000 a day for six weeks. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to grant <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence in exchange for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops helping <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government fight U.S.-backed rebels.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader: Summit Will Fail Without Rebel-Gov't Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said Wednesday an African summit aimed at resolving the Angolan civil war will fail unless direct talks begin between the rebels and the government. But he told a news conference at his bush camp that `` never in 14 years of war have we come so close'' to peace. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s official news agency announced Wednesday the government released 700 rebel prisoners. The dispatch said the prisoners were released June 2 and reported the prisoners had renounced the rebel movement and accepted the government's offer of clemency. The announcement came on the eve of a meeting of African leaders in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The meeting could clear the way for direct peace talks between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and the rebel <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said his delegation in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> was willing to be flexible about procedures leading to elections and formation of a national unity government. But, he said, the rebels would reject any amnesty or clemency for the guerrillas. `` Our army, 75,000 men in the field, will not accept amnesty, clemency or integration'' into the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` That wording has a political context that means -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- is considered criminal. Our army was not defeated and is not going to be defeated.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said he has agreed to stay out of the negotiations and will not demand a role in any transitional government. But he said he would remain the head of his party. He also wants to participate in free elections he anticipates within two years of a formal cease-fire. He dismissed reports he might go into exile, saying he would remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after a cease-fire, but not necessarily in his southeastern stronghold of <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government has rejected elections, insisting on maintaining one-party rule and offering some rebels positions in the administration. The Angolan news service <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' has a peace plan calling for <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> to go abroad, recognize the legitimacy of the government and for the rebel movement to be integrated into the one-party state. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> vehemently vetoed all these proposals at his news conference. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said the Angolan government was under pressure, because within six months, half of the 50,000 Cuban soldiers who have supported it will have left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> under a U.S.-mediated southern African peace agreement reached in December. The Cubans have agreed to a gradual withdrawal, to be completed by July 1991. But <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have promised to `` help the Cubans leave quickly'' if the peace talks lead to formation of a transitional unity government before then. The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war to force the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> - and Soviet-assisted government to share power since shortly after <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> praised Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> for organizing the summit, expected to be attended by leaders from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tome </LOCATION> e Principe, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>. According to news reports in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> might also travel to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> to participate in the indirect talks. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was preparing to fly out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> after the news conference Wednesday but did not say where he was going. At the request of <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON>, the rebels have declared a `` de facto'' cease-fire and are conducting only defensive operations. He said the government army is still attacking, `` trying to capture prisoners for their amnesty,'' but with much less intensity than in the past.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Raises Possibility of Child Care Veto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Wednesday raised the prospect that a child-care package being pushed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership would be vetoed and Republicans sought support for an alternative the White House supports The specter of a veto was raised in an administration policy statement distributed on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debated the issue for a fifth day. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, however, a spokesman said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still hoped to reach agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a plan. In the three-page policy statement, the administration said the child-care package being advocated by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders with the help of one leading <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senator, <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, `` is fundamentally flawed'' and that if it reached the White House <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` senior advisers would recommend that he veto it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was less direct when asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would veto the legislation if it clears <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as it stands now. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration believed its tax credit proposal was the best approach to helping low-income parents pay for child care but was `` willing to talk about alternatives and how this could be approved.'' The legislation before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is a revised version of the Act for Better Child Care sponsored by <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. It authorizes $ 1.75 billion to be spent on child care in fiscal 1990 through subsidies to parents and states to help pay for child care and expand its availability. States would be required to give 70 percent of the money directly to low-income families for child care expenses, with the rest used to fund and administer state programs designed to improve the quality and quantity of child care. Tacked on to the measure is a package of tax credits designed to help parents offset the costs of child care and health insurance. Those credits, endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, are similar to the credits at the heart of the alternative package being offered by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> with the support of the White House. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers have virtually ignored the tax-credit provisions of the revised Dodd-Hatch plan and focused their attacks on the subsidy provisions of the measure, which they contend give too much control of the money to state governments and not enough to parents. The alternative Republican plan includes an expansion of the existing earned-income tax credit for parents with children under age 5 and a proposal to provide money up front to low-income families who can not take advantage of the dependent-care credit because their incomes are so low they do not pay taxes. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to kill the Democratic leadership plan in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> approach. Republicans have been lobbying Southern Democrats in hope of winning enough support for their package, but the Democratic leadership says it has the votes to quash the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> effort.

<HEAD>Key Burmese Opposition Leader Arrested, Released</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s main opposition leader and 15 supporters were detained Wednesday during a ceremony to honor people slain last year during a military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, official sources said. The sources said <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and her followers were interrogated for about an hour and then released. They spoke on condition of anonymity. No official statement was made about the incident at <LOCATION> Myeinigon </LOCATION>, four miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the incident would be a `` grave blow to hopes that next year's election will be free and fair. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the administration has noted with concern the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government's restrictions on political activity, including a ban on gatherings of five or more people, prohibition of opposition publications and harassment and arrest of opposition party leaders. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> is the daughter of deceased national hero Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>. A 44-year-old political neophyte, she is widely regarded as the most powerful opposition figure in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. Her party appears to have the biggest backing among the more than 200 that have mushroomed since last year's pro-democracy movement. She held a religious ceremony with her followers at a branch office of her National League for Democracy and then walked to the spot where several demonstrators were shot by police last June 21. Several hundred people were present at the wreath-laying when authorities moved in. Witnesses said <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and the others were taken away in open military trucks to a government office near where the ceremony took place. In recent months, <LOCATION> Aung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kyi </LOCATION> has been harassed on occasion but generally been given considerable leeway by the military government to campaign throughout the country. She returned to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, her home for many years, to look after her ailing mother in April 1988, and became embroiled in political turmoil sweeping <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> at the time. She became one of the main leaders of a pro-democracy uprising that seemed on the verge of toppling 26 years of authoritarian rule through massive street demonstrations. But in September, Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and a group of military officers brutally crushed the student-led protests and clamped martial law on the country. The new leaders allowed the formation of opposition political parties and have promised free general elections next year. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> joined with two popular leaders, retired Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and former Defense Minister Tin Oo, to form the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> later left the group, claiming the league was being infiltrated by communists.

 Britons walked, cycled, hitchhiked, shared cars or simply stayed home Wednesday as a one-day strike idled the national railroads and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s buses and subways. It was believed to be the first triple-barreled transport action since the 1926 general strike, according to <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground. Careful planning and bright skies made it less nightmarish than commuters expected, however. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotels were full of employees spending the night in the city to beat the strike. Many companies hired fleets of buses, and <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> passenger ferries reported business was booming. Some judges at the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court spent the night in their offices, and hundreds of judges, lawyers and jurors walked or cycled, enabling 17 of the 19 courtrooms to function normally. An early shortage of stenographers forced some judges to take their own notes as hearings got under way. Senior prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevan </PERSON> cycled for several miles through slow-moving traffic, carrying his gown in a bag on his back, and he said he would n't like to repeat the experience. `` My nerves are shattered,'' he said. `` It really is a most dangerous occupation.'' `` I saw a car with three bikes on the roof, two in the back, and five people in the car. I guess they just drive as far as they can and get on their bikes,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilligan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bicycle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Forewarned by police to drive only if necessary, motorists set out two or three hours early `` Traffic was in fact quieter than normal on most of the motorway routes around <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> also reported earlier rush hours, with traffic little worse than normal. `` It looks as if motorists have been sensible, going in earlier and car-sharing,'' said the AA in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> parking garages were packed, and police refused to ease parking restrictions, saying it would encourage more people to drive into the capital. However, free parking was set aside for buses bringing in commuters. Evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> also laid on extra free parking at Crystal Palace in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he was preaching Wednesday night. Overcoming traditional English reserve, many suburbanites shared cars or were seen hitchhiking to work. Travelers using <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> airports were urged to use buses rather than taxis. <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION>'s express train to central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was idled, as was the subway line to <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. On strike were 75,000 rail workers, 18,500 operators of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s red double-decker buses and 10,500 subway workers, leaving only some private suburban bus routes operating in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> It was the seventh subway strike in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 11 weeks, but only the first by rail workers since 1982. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s buses and subway system carry more than 3 million passengers a day and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s national network carries 2 million daily The rail unions are rejecting state-owned <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s offer of a 7 percent wage increase, and their tempers have been inflamed by the employer's unsuccessful attempts to block the strike in the courts. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railwaymen </ORGANIZATION> says it scrupulously followed Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s union-curbing laws, which require unions to poll their members secretly and obtain a 55 percent majority for a walkout. The bus workers have rejected an increase of 8 percent or 9 percent and want 14 percent. The subway workers want a $ 99 weekly increase to operate without a guard. Management is offering $ 46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation, but is tying the raise to increased productivity. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, displaying her deep dislike for the unions that dominated British life until her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> took office in 1979, on Tuesday denounced the railway workers as `` typically selfish ... deliberately causing massive inconvenience to those who have to work.'' The transport strikes, coupled with a surge in inflation to 8.3 percent and interest rates at 14 percent, have taken some of the shine off <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economic recovery under Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, and are seen as one of the reasons for the rout of the <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> in last week's elections to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>

 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>, whose lifelong friendships with reputed mobsters tarnished and eventually ended his career as <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s top legislator and top judge, died Wednesday. He was 70. <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> died at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. No further information was immediately available, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Buratti </PERSON>. He had been hospitalized several times during the last few months in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, most recently in early May for a heart attack. He was taken to <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's on May 30 when he complained of problems with his medication, relatives said. <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> was elected to the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> in 1954 and maintained a successful criminal law practice while he rose through the ranks to become majority leader in 1966 and speaker in 1969. Questions about his ties to criminals came into the open when the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elected him chief justice of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1976. Among them were allegations that <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> had harbored a fugitive from a 1963 department store robbery and accepted $ 2,000 of the loot from him. The fugitive, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Northrop </PERSON>, later recanted his story. Then-Attorney General <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON> investigated the matter in 1977 but concluded there was `` no prosecutable case.'' At about the same time, a letter surfaced in which <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> told the state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 that <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON>, the late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> organized-crime boss, was `` a person of integrity and, in my opinion, good moral character.'' The Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline took no action after it investigated the letter and <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>'s officiating at the the wedding of <PERSON> Patriarca </PERSON>'s chauffeur six months after becoming chief justice. The chauffeur, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Badway </PERSON>, was under indictment for fraud at the time. The series of events that finally brought <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> down began at the end of 1984, with a <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> story alleging that state police and the newspaper's reporters had observed <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> repeatedly visiting the homes of underworld figures. The state police subsequently alleged that <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> had also visited a <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION> motel, owned by men linked to gambling and drugs, for trysts with his secretary and another woman to whom he was not married. The judicial commission launched a new investigation, hiring former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> as special counsel, and censured <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> for associating with criminals. <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> agreed to take an unpaid four-month leave of absence in 1985. When the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> convened the next year, it launched impeachment proceedings. Two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> began public hearings on the matter, <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> resigned. In February 1987, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON>'s personal finances were under investigation. At the time <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> stepped down, the impeachment hearings had begun to focus on his personal finances, which he handled in cash and through third parties. He is survived by his wife, two sons and daughter. Funeral plans were incomplete.

 A robber who shot a convenience store clerk to death was executed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s gas chamber, insisting to the last that he was convicted unfairly because of racial discrimination. A doctor at the <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Parchman </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was heavily sedated at his own request. But the lethal fumes awakened him and he cried out and gasped before he died at 12:15 a.m. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was the fourth person executed at the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> penitentiary and the 113th in the nation since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the death penalty in 1976. He was executed for the shooting death of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> convenience store clerk <PERSON> Linzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> in a June 14, 1980, robbery that netted $ 111. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> was shot while he talked on the telephone. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who was black, was convicted by an all-white <ORGANIZATION> Hinds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury and was sentenced to death April 1, 1981. Defense attorneys protested that prosecutors deliberately excluded blacks from the jury, but four appeals courts disagreed. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> maintained again in a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, newspaper interview published Tuesday that he did not receive a fair trial, recalling that when he saw the all-white jury he said, `` I'm dead.'' Late Tuesday, Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> rejected a plea for clemency. `` I will not stand in the way of the courts' justice. ... <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> is a mass murderer who killed in cold blood,'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. `` He tried and failed to get relief in 16 appeals to the courts, and discrimination had no bearing in his case.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused, in a 7-2 vote, to delay the execution on procedural grounds. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, who also was black, was killed during a five-day robbery spree by <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> that left three people dead and one wounded. White, who got three life terms, testified that <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told him he had shot the store clerk to avoid being identified later. Before his execution, family members including his mother and daughter spent most of the day with <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. He also talked with a priest.

<HEAD>Criminal Charges Dropped Against Interns Who Went on Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities said Wednesday they have dropped criminal charges against medical interns arrested during a four-day strike last week. The decision was made `` in the public interest'' and to smooth the way for a settlement of grievances, according to a government statement. Several hundred striking interns at state hospitals and clinics stayed off the job to demand a review of salaries and working conditions. More than 70 were detained by police June 14 on charges they violated laws barring those working in essential services from going on strike. The strikers spent a night in jail but were then released and ordered to appear in court June 29 and July 19. The crimes with which they were charged carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail. There were no reports of deaths of patients during the strike. The stoppage ended after the government promised to settle grievances in the state health service. Health minister <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Muchemwa </PERSON> said salaries will be raised and their compulsory attachment to state health facilities will be reduced from five years to three years. Interns earn a monthly income of about $ 300. <PERSON> Muchemwa </PERSON> did not release details of the pay offer. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cakana </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday his organization was reserving its comments until interns have studied the offer.

<TEXT>
 The nation's mayors called for higher federal taxes and tougher gun laws Wednesday, but their near-unanimity on issues was shattered by a partisan leadership battle. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a vocal critic of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, was elected to a top post of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> after the group's only floor fight of their five-day meeting. It came at the end of a conference where partisanship flared into the open, in contrast to recent previous gatherings where mayors did their best to blur party distinctions. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>'s contest against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, was unprecedented in the group's 57-year history, which usually decides on its leadership in private. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>'s election was for the unglamorous title of chairman of the conference's advisory committee. But it is coveted because it is third on the group's leadership ladder and means <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> will become conference president, and leading spokesman for the nation's mayors, in 1991 if he remains mayor of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The vote for <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> was decided largely along party lines, 67-35. But the group's incoming president, Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, voted for the Republican. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> has spoken with optimism and conciliation toward the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, she is from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and she faces a tough re-election race this year. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said at issue in the dispute was whether mayors were willing to be aggressive in criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration urban policies. `` I do n't think this is the time for mayors to sit back and just go along, to say everything's all right in our cities,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Everything is not all right in our cities. ... The Federal government has walked away from our cities.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said he would decide next year whether to run for governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Among the more than 50 policy statements approved by the full conference was one calling on the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise federal taxes to reduce the deficit and to finance greater spending on urban problems. The mayors approved a resolution calling for an outright ban on possession, as well as manufacture and sale, of `` military-type'' semi-automatic assault weapons. That goes far beyond <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ban on the importation of foreign-made assault weapons and would, if law, render illegal thousands of such weapons now owned by Americans. The mayors' policy statements become the new policies that will guide the conference's lobbying efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The only real policy debate came on a resolution saying the mayors `` deplore'' recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions which they say weaken affirmative action programs, `` making it more difficult to ensure equal opportunities in employment for all Americans.'' The mayors overwhelmingly voted down an effort by some <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> mayors to soften the language of their resolution on anti-discrimination in employment. Mayor <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradbury </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, argued that whites have been victims of reverse discrimination. Other resolutions called for tougher action against drugs, poverty, homelessness and AIDS. But in an earlier committee, mayors deleted a proposal offered by <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> to encourage free distribution of needles to drug adicts to reduce the spread of AIDS.

<HEAD>Court Decision Gives Media Added Protection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gave the news media added protection Wednesday, ruling that a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> newspaper does n't have to pay $ 97,500 to a rape victim whose name it published. The court, by a 6-3 vote, limited states' power to punish the reporting of truthful information that is lawfully obtained. The three dissenting justices criticized the court in a strongly worded opinion for hampering efforts to protect the privacy of sex-crime victims. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law makes it a crime to `` print, publish or broadcast'' the names of victims of sexual crime. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly newspaper in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, published a rape victim's name in its Oct. 29, 1983, police report. The name had been obtained from a report posted, apparently by mistake, in the press room of the <ORGANIZATION> Duval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Most news organizations, including The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, have policies against publication of rape victim's names. The name of the woman, identified in court records as B.J.F., was published inadvertently, the newpaper's lawyers said. Relying on the state law, the rape victim sued and won the $ 97,500 award, which threatened to put the 18,000-circulation paper out of business. Her suit also named the sheriff's department as a defendant, but she was paid $ 2,500 in a pre-trial settlement. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the award violated free-press rights protected by the Constitution's First Amendment. However, the ruling did not preclude the possibility that states may punish those who publish the name of a sex-crime victim. `` We do not hold that truthful publication is automatically constitutionally protected, or that there is no zone of privacy within which the state may protect the individual from intrusion by the press,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> wrote. `` We hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful information which it has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully be imposed, if at all, only when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order.'' That interest was not present in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> dissented. `` I would find a place to draw the line higher on the hillside: a spot high enough to protect B.J.F.'s desire for privacy and peace of mind in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, writing for the three. `` There is no public interest in publishing the names, addresses and phone numbers of persons who are the victims of crime _ and no public interest in immunizing the press from liability in the rare cases where a state's efforts to protect a victim's privacy have failed,'' he said. White noted that the woman's name was published a week after the assault, before her assailant had been arrested. `` As a result, B.J.F. received harassing phone calls, required mental health counseling, was forced to move from her home, and was even threatened with being raped again,'' he said. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, said he was pleased with Wednesday's decision. `` We were being denied to publish the truth,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` It constituted prior restraint.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said that if the award had been upheld it might have led to laws restricting the reporting of names of victims of other types of crimes. `` A person being raped is no worse than a person being killed,'' he said. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s opinion noted past high court decisions on `` the conflict between truthful reporting and state-protected privacy interests.'' The court in 1975 barred states from imposing sanctions for the publication of truthful information _ a rape victim's name _ contained in official court records open to public inspection. A 1977 decision struck down a state law that barred the news media from publishing the name or photograph of an 11-year-old boy in connection with a juvenile court proceeding reporters had attended. And in 1979, the court invalidated a state law that made it a crime for newspapers to publish, without written approval of a juvenile court, the name of any youth charged as a juvenile offender _ even if that information were obtained lawfully. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s opinion was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

 Western nations on Wednesday condemned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s execution of three men involved in pro-democracy unrest, and some said they may impose punitive sanctions on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said she was `` utterly appalled'' by the executions. `` The punishment is totally out of proportion to the crime,'' she said. The men were convicted of setting fire to a train on June 6 in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> after it ran through a barricade set up by protesters, killing six people. That protest came three days after Chinese soldiers cleared central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> of pro-democracy demonstrators and supporters. Eight other protesters previously had been sentenced to death in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and up to 17 more were condemned to death Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she and Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> were discussing possible sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She would not elaborate. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> already has canceled all ministerial visits and, like <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, protested the Chinese crackdown on the student-led movement. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he would try to block $ 1.4 billion in development loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He also canceled all high-level contacts, including a July trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> held a news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday to urge the administration to step up economic pressure on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` The only language the Chinese government can listen to is economic sanctions,'' said <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueliang </PERSON>, 36, a sociologist and graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deeply regretted the executions but planned no further sanctions. `` There is an important relationship which we should seek to preserve if we possibly can,'' he said. French Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> denounced the executions in a speech before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` What is happening in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is atrocious,'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> said. `` The totalitarian machine, in all its horror, is rolling. It turns what should be judicial decisions into veritable murders.'' He added, `` In the name of the president, I reiterate here <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s appeal to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities to show clemency and renounce executions and repression.'' The West German government was `` deeply upset'' and renewed its appeal for clemency for the others sentenced to death, said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chancelor </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s spokesman. He said the executions represented a `` dangerous return to the times of human-degrading totalitarianism in the years before 1978.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was `` very saddened'' by the executions and has appealed for clemency for others, according to his spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON>. The Dutch government said it was seized by `` disgust.'' `` This new sad fact can only lead to a further cooling of relations,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. A ministry spokesman said the executions were expected to be discussed at next week's <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The Belgian government said it had learned `` with a great shock'' of the executions. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the government deplored that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had ignored the numerous appeals for clemency. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said: `` I think it's a most deplorable situation ... a most regrettable turn of events.'' The world apeared powerless to persuade <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to change its tactics in crushing the pro-democracy movement, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> agreed. `` The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and it does not appear to have made much difference,'' he said. `` History has shown that they generally are not that responsive to outside kinds of pleas.''

<HEAD>Job Service Employees Suspended Following Discrimination Check</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten employees of a state job service agency have been suspended for a month without pay for agreeing to requests to provide only white male applicants for certain job openings, officials said. Such actions are `` totally in violation of anything this department is about,'' said state Jobs and Training Commissioner <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Samargia </PERSON>, whose department oversees the job service offices. The suspensions announced Tuesday came after an investigation by the state <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which made tape-recorded phone calls to state employment offices in April and May. In the calls, job applicants were requested for a fictitious employer. `` They were told, ` We do n't want any females and we do n't want any minorities _ we just want white males,''' said state Human Rights Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. `` We made 12 different calls and 10 came up bad and two came up good.'' After the findings, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jobs </ORGANIZATION> and Training and the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reached agreement on training and rules to ensure that discriminatory job orders are n't accepted in the future. `` We were going to file some charges, but they were willing to work with us so we did n't need to,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Samargia </PERSON> said the 10 job service interviewers were suspended last week. Reconstructing one conversation, <PERSON> Samargia </PERSON> said a job service worker told the undercover caller that the discriminatory order could not be accepted as offered but that the order would be handled as the caller desired. `` If <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> found out, I'd be in trouble,'' the employee said, according to <LOCATION> Samargia </LOCATION>. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, a union representing nine of the suspended employees, said it is contesting the suspensions. `` They were totally inappropriate,'' said union president <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> LeWon </PERSON>, contending that the department provided little, if any training for employees on how to handle such matters. <PERSON> Samargia </PERSON> insisted, `` We've had training on this.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, artistic director of the American Ballet Theatre for nine years, will step down at the end of the 1990 season, the company's board of trustees announced Wednesday. The board learned Tuesday night of his decision to leave, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontarelli </PERSON>, the company's director of public relations. `` I would say this is a surprise. It was unexpected,'' he said. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, 41, became ABT's artistic director in September 1980. He joined the company in 1974 after defecting from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where he danced with the Kirov ballet company. `` I will have given 10 years to the company, and it has been a true challenge,'' he said. `` The dancers in the company are superb. Of all the responsibilities associated with being artistic director, I've enjoyed working with the dancers more than anything else.'' <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> said he would `` pursue other professional options'' but did not elaborate. He is starring on Broadway in `` Metamorphosis,'' a play based on <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s story, and has appeared in such films as `` White Nights'' and `` The Turning Point.'' He also recently launched a perfume for women called `` Misha,'' his nickname. A search committee will be formed to find a successor, <PERSON> Pontarelli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Melville </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, chairman of the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement: `` <PERSON> Misha </PERSON> has brought <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> into a new era and has set a standard of excellence by which the company will be measured in years to come.''

<HEAD>Energy Official Says Power Shortages are Looming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation soon may face a shortage of electricity, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday in comments reflecting a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration campaign to convince the public of a need for more nuclear power plants. `` The demand for electricity in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is growing beyond our ability to provide additional generating capacity,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON>, the undersecretary of energy. He noted that electricity accounts for 37 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy use. Tuck said it was `` inescapable'' that many more power plants will be needed if the economy is to continue to grow at a reasonable rate, adding that utilities have balked at such construction because of the high cost and lack of public support. No new nuclear plants have been ordered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1978. `` Considering all these factors, it is apparent that the nation may have an electricity shortage on its hands in the not-too-distant future,'' <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON> said in remarks to an industry-sponsored symposium on nuclear reactors and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy security. Tuck cited the case of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power station, which <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state is planning to dismantle even though it recently gained a license to operate. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is trying to block the move, arguing that <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> is needed as a regional energy source and a national symbol of nuclear power's future Tuck said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is eager to complete research and development on several new types of nuclear reactors designed to be safer and more reliable than the light-water reactors that have been used in this country since the 1950s. `` We at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> believe that nuclear energy, led by a new generation of advanced reactors, will have a role in averting a possible electricity shortage,'' he said. Tuck said a greater reliance on nuclear power also would help limit the nation's dependence on foreign oil, although this is disputed by many private analysts. They note that while nuclear power's only non-military role is to generate electricity, oil-fired plant produce only about 5 percent of the nation's electricity. About two-thirds of the oil is used in cars and other vehicles. Nuclear power plants generate about 20 percent of the electricity supply.

<HEAD>Soviet Ship Moving Too Fast When It Rammed Iceberg</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Norwegians involved in the rescue of hundreds of passengers from a Soviet liner said on Wednesday that it was going too fast for safety when it rammed into an iceberg and took on water in arctic seas. The head of the medical team aboard a Norwegian rescue ship said some of the Soviet crew were drunk at the time. Others involved in the rescue contradicted him. Ships and helicopters took the 575 passengers, all but a dozen West Germans, to shelter on <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. They were flown Wednesday to <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, cutting short their pleasure cruise to the land of the midnight sun. About half the 378 Soviet crewmen stayed on board to nurse the Maxim Gorky to harbor. The disabled 25,000-ton vessel was limping under its own power in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION>, about 180 miles east of the accident, Norwegian defense officials said. Dr. <PERSON> Mads </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, aboard the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter Senja when it broke through thick ice to rescue the people, said `` our impression was that some of the crew were intoxicated.'' `` We were suprised at the extent of intoxication,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> told state radio. He said many crew members were too drunk to help operate pumps 12 hours after the accident. Rescued passengers, some of whom spent seven hours in lifeboats at near-freezing temperatures, said they had been offered whiskey and vodka during the ordeal to ward off the cold. `` The German passengers had nothing but praise for the Soviet crew and said nothing about drunken crewmen,'' said <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Leif </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldring </PERSON>, who met arriving passengers early Wednesday. `` If the crew had been drunk, the Maxim Gorky would have sunk,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. Maritime experts said the ship was moving at 21 mph when it struck the ice, much faster than it should have sailed in treacherous waters. `` I would hardly have sailed faster than two to three knots in such ice-clogged water,'' said <PERSON> Sigurd </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON>, captain of the Senja. <PERSON> Guttorm </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, a skipper who has sailed the arctic for 40 years, told the <ORGANIZATION> Verdens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> newspaper agreed, saying: `` The <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> must have been too eager to keep its schedule.'' The collision tore a gash 20 feet long and four to six inches wide in the bow. The ship took on 18,000 tons of water and was listing badly when the passengers scrambled into lifeboats. For West German passenger <PERSON> Giesela </PERSON> <PERSON> Rillinger </PERSON>, `` It was six hours of nothing but ice floes and the sky. If a storm had come up it would have been all over for us. Six hours of facing death.'' Passenger <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sontheimer </PERSON>, 71, also interviewed in <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>, said most people were seasick and `` the waves bounced us against each other.'' Some left the rafts and climbed onto ice floes for fear of being crushed between drifting blocks of ice. `` We stood on the ice and all around us, it cracked and crashed together. One had that feeling that if you turned around those standing behind you would disappear,'' said Lutheran minister <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Drosihn </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRK </ORGANIZATION> report said a lifeboat with 50 elderly passengers got stuck as it was being lowered into the water and dangled for four hours halfway down <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>'s side. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said sailors plugged the holes in the bow. It would receive emergency repairs on <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>AMA Endorses Federal Mandated, Employer-Provided Health Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, for the first time in its history, endorsed Wednesday the concept of federally mandated, employer-provided health insurance. Under a proposal passed by delegates at the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual policymaking convention, the nation's largest organization of doctors agreed to press for legislation calling for `` a phased-in requirement that employers -LRB- limited initially to larger employers -RRB- provide health-insurance coverage within the private sector for all full-time employees, with coverage expanding over several years.'' In addition, the delegates recommended `` a program of diminishing tax credits or other incentives to avoid adverse effects on employers.'' The policy adopted by the 433 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> calls for the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> to work with business groups to develop the approaches that are best suited to the needs of small employers. Such legislation would help the nation's 37 million uninsured and also would allow doctors to recover fees lost under the Medicaid program, an <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Small businesses have lobbied heavily against proposals calling for any type of federally mandated employer-provided insurance, and an industry spokeswoman said they would do the same with measures like that endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> lobbying organization representing about 50,000 small businesses, said that while the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s desire to include small businesses in developing national legislation is a step in the right direction, `` there's still a fundamental question of government mandates that we're opposed to.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s action is part of the organization's effort to combat moves to nationalize the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health care system. A group of physicians started such an effort this year, seeking adoption of a system similar to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s in which individuals and employers are taxed to pay for health coverage for all. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION> strongly opposes the Canadian system, in which `` all responsibility for health care payment is placed on the government.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> also opposes a move led by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., to force employers to provide a specific package of health-insurance benefits for employees, said Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant executive vice president That plan, with no gradual phase-in, `` might cause an employer not to hire an extra person, or it might cause a business to go broke,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> favors less drastic reforms and advocates `` the principle that employees be covered by health insurance in the workplace,'' he said. `` It's a major national problem.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said it was the first time the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> had endorsed the concept of federally mandated, employer-provided health insurance. In other action Wednesday, the delegates elected the first female phsyician to the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION>, its governing body. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, thanked the delegates for the `` history you have just made.'' Women have been appointed in the past by other board members to student and resident trustee positions, but <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> is the first to be elected a regular trustee by the full delegation. Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> internist and president-elect for the past year, was named president of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> takes over the one-year post from Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, surgeon.

<TEXT>
 Israeli politicians said in a stormy parliament debate Wednesday that vigilante action by Jewish settlers could push the country to the brink of civil war. Legislators were divided about how to curb government-armed Jewish settlers living in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Arab assailants in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> shot and killed 47-year-old taxi driver <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharoub </PERSON> on Wednesday. He was suspected of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> radio reports and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists said. The army said it was investigating. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 12 Palestinians were wounded in confrontations with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops Wednesday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed one of the wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and said three other Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sharoub </PERSON>'s death brings to 527 the toll of Palestinians killed in their 18-month rebellion against Israeli occupation. Among the dead are 64 suspected collaborators. Twenty-three Israelis also have died. Israeli leaders raised the specter of civil warfare after Jewish settlers, angered at the weekend killing of a U.S.-born settler, went on rampages after his funeral Tuesday. Three Palestinian shepherds have been detained for the killing of <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, 48, who was stabbed Saturday as he hiked around Arab villages near his <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of Ariel. Settlers at <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>'s funeral shouted down Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, calling him a traitor and accusing him of failing to protect Jews living in the territories. After the funeral, one settler pumped submachine gunfire at Arabs waiting for rides near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, wounding two. At least four other Palestinians were injured when their cars were hit by stones thrown by Jewish protesters. Earlier, fistfights erupted at the burial service when settlers attacked a left-wing activist and then struck soldiers who rescued the man. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say they fear the settlers increasingly could direct their violence at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or Jewish political rivals. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> on Wednesday urged Israelis not to battle among themselves. `` We must do everything to make sure such a war never happens,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` This is the most dangerous thing.'' `` I would suggest to everyone to lower the profile of our internal debates,'' he said. The debate in the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament, left legislators divided over whether the army should take harsher action to crush the Palestinian revolt or to restrict settlers. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> said if only a small number of settlers are violent, as the government suggests, they should be jailed. But <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, a former army chief of staff from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Tsomet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said it was the government's failure to curb <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> violence that prompted settlers' actions. `` In a situation where the government is not capable of maintaining the security of its citizens, hotheads are always liable to stand up and take the law into their own hands,'' he said. Legislators joined in condemning the violence. <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> said the incidents `` must shock us all into seeing what can happen in the future.'' <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> said: `` All is ready for a civil war. There are enough weapons to prove people are ready to kill innocent civilians.''

<TEXT>
 A black priest who plans to start a separate African-American Catholic congregation said Wednesday he is not defying <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> tenets, despite warnings from church leaders. `` While the establishment of this congregation does not enjoy the endorsement or authority of His Eminence, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, we see ourselves as being obedient to the law of God and following the dictates of our consciences,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, 41, said he plans to create the <ORGANIZATION> Imani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has failed to meet the spiritual and cultural demands of its black parishioners However, the priest said his move is not intended to be a departure from Catholicism.

Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholics </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, also expressed criticism, in a statement issued by <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>'s office. `` Although I acknowledge that we as African-American Catholics still find it necessary to struggle for full inclusion in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Imani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> is a regressive step,'' <PERSON> Ricard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' former <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> parishioners should not support his efforts and that doing so would leave them in an `` ambiguous position'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said of his own situation, `` I can not be excommunicated from my faith. ... When I lay down I have to answer not to an institution but to the man that woke me up.'' Of the nation's 300 bishops, 13 are black. While there are about 1,100 predominantly black parishes nationwide, there are just 200 black priests. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> made his announcement even though the bishops, in their national conference, committed themselves only last Sunday to stronger efforts to support the black Catholic community. But <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said those efforts fall short of black parishioners' needs.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s execution of three people Wednesday for burning a train during a pro-democracy protest flouted worldwide calls for mercy in the government's crackdown on political dissent. The death sentences, announced on radio and television, were carried out in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where the arson incident occurred June 6. The executions came a day after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealed for clemency, and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had turned its back on the pleas. `` The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and it does not appear to have made much difference,'' he said. `` History has shown that they generally are not that responsive to outside kinds of pleas.'' So far, 28 people have been condemned to death: the three who were executed, the 17 who were sentenced on Wednesday after a public trial in <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province, and eight others in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> who were previously sentenced to death. Their crimes ranged from `` rumor-mongering'' to beating soldiers and burning vehicles. The three executed were convicted of setting fire to a train after it smashed through a barricade set up by demonstrators, killing six people. The three then beat firefighters who tried to douse the blaze, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday suspended high-level U.S.-Chinese contacts and moved to block $ 1.4 billion in development loans to protest the crackdown. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> already had frozen relations and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has suspended new development loans. The government depends heavily on foreign investment for capital and technology, and has stressed during the past two weeks that things are back to normal in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> did not immediately respond to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moves, but the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s affairs and that there would be no mercy. `` The 11 thugs have been sentenced to death according to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s criminal law, because they committed heinous crimes of beating, smashing, looting and burning,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> before the additional sentences were announced Other nations had joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in urging clemency, and some denounced <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> following the executions. `` What is happening in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is atrocious,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` The totalitarian machine, in all its horror, is rolling.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that she and Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> were discussing steps against the Chinese government. `` The punishment is totally out of proportion to the crime,'' she said. In the <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, the Dutch government said it was seized by `` disgust.'' `` This new sad fact can only lead to a further cooling of relations,'' said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began its crackdown on the pro-democracy movement on June 3 and has said the matter is a domestic affair. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said Monday the government would spare no effort in tracking down protest organizers. The approach is not new. In a 1987 speech, senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> said that after widespread arrests of pro-democracy protesters 10 years ago, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> suffered `` no discredit,'' and that `` on the contrary, the prestige of the country is steadily growing.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could not afford to turn its back on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> even though it deplored the crackdown. `` Everyone has to recognize, first of all, that this is a country of a billion people ... a sizeable portion of the world's population that can not be closeted off and ignored,'' he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> imposes the death penalty for certain violent and economic crimes but also for some political offenses, and often for crimes involving foreigners. In April a court in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> sentenced a man to death after he was convicted of robbing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate in that city over a period of 14 months of about $ 8,900. The human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in 1985 that 10,000 people had been executed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since a nationwide crackdown on crime two years earlier. Chinese officials do not release figures on executions.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended nearly a decade of icy relations Wednesday when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker invited <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the two leaders agreed on wide economic cooperation. Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> told the Soviet president that Iranians hold him in high esteem and look forward to meeting him, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> for the invitation and said frequent high-level contacts are appropraite as relations warm. No date was set. Only a handful of Third World leaders have visited <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since the 1979 Islamic Revolution transformed the Iranian capital into a city known for mobs of religious fanatics shouting, `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>! Death to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>!'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have been meeting in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> over two days with a number of their colleagues. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said they will sign several agreements before <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> leaves <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Among them are a promise to be good neighbors on their 1,550-mile border and an agreement on joint projects in 15 areas of the economy, including nuclear energy, gas processing, and space. The level of relations, which may extend to putting an Iranian on board a Soviet spaceship, marks a dramatic turnaround. Earlier this decade, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was supplying weapons for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to fight <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s fundamentalist regime was banning <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying Wednesday, `` I have been in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> less than 24 hours, yet already I feel almost at home.'' <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is extending his visit beyond the planned Thursday departure. It was <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> who suggested a joint Soviet-Iranian space voyage, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ordered his deputies to begin planning details. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> emphasized that it was <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> himself who in February, several months before his death on June 3, called for better relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> noted that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> exchanged messages in February, and since then their foreign ministers have met four times. `` We should admit that in the past we had periods where our border turned into a blank wall,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> banquet for <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. `` It is good that those times apparently have passed.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had hoped the revolution that ousted the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, a longtime <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, would give it a toehold in the nation on its southern border. Instead, Iranian fundamentalists chose an independent path and held <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in disdain. Now, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, rail links will be restored and another rail line constructed. With ties to the West strained, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is looking to the Soviet bloc for help in rebuilding <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which halted with a cease-fire in August. Iranian officials said last month they hoped to sign an arms deal with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said nothing on the subject.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday lifted its grounding order on 12 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 planes operated by British airlines provided modifications are made to the engines. The planes were grounded nine days ago after two incidents in which 737-400s were forced to make emergency landings because fan blades broke in their CFM 56-3C engines. The engines are manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s aviation authority imposed power cuts of 1,500 pounds of thrust on the CFM 56-3C engines, effectively converting them to a previous generation of that make. The planes will be allowed a maximum thrust of 22,000 pounds, the same as the previous <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> 56-3B, which had 6 million hours of reliable service. Airlines were also ordered to replace the engines' fan blades and discs. Regular visual inspections of fan blades and the front face of the engine discs will also be required, a spokesman for the British authority said. Airlines were already making the modifications and some 737-400s might be back in operation on Thursday, he said. Demonstrations Wednesday by the engine manufacturer showed that fan fatigue occurred near the peak in the engine's thrust, the spokesman said. `` It has now been found that running it at that higher speed, particularly at the rate of climb, has induced something that will need further investigation,'' he said. The grounding order was made after fan blades broke on a DanAir plane at <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on June 9 and on a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> aircraft at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on June 11. Fan blade problems were also thought to have contributed to the engine failure that led to the January crash of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> 737-400 near <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Leicestershire </LOCATION>, killing 47. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> rejected the British authority's grounding request and cleared 737-400s to fly with the lower engine thrust and new blades and discs. In addition to British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and DanAir, 737-400s are operated by <PERSON> Novair </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> and Air UK-Leisure.

 A Soviet man who apparently stowed away in the undercarriage of a Japanese jet was found crushed to death Wednesday when the plane arrived from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, police and airline officials said. All <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said the dead man is believed to be a 21-year-old Russian who had been trying to emigrate.

 A judge temporarily restored driving privileges Wednesday to a married teen-ager whose license was suspended under a law aimed at curbing a high rate of school dropouts. <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> set aside <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mean </PERSON>'s license suspension for 30 days to allow attorneys to file briefs in the case. Means, 17, of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, who dropped out of the ninth grade last year, appealed a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION> decision to suspend his license under a first-of-its-kind law aimed at reducing the state's dropout rate, now about 17 percent. Under education reform law passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last summer, students under 18 who miss more than 10 consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences must give up their driving privileges. Means' attorney, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Butch </PERSON>, argued that the law was in conflict with another state law permitting students to drop out of school at age 16. The law, he said, was condemning Means and his family to poverty because he was unable to earn the money he needed to support his family without a driver's license. `` The law is not only draconian, it's unreasonable in this case,'' <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> told the court Wednesday. Means' 16-year-old wife, <PERSON> Tonya </PERSON>, who is expecting a child in August, said the state was preventing her husband from caring for her and their unborn child. Her license also was suspended because she is a dropout. `` We have the same responsibilities as anyone over 18,'' she said. `` He has a house to pay for and has to earn money to care for me and the baby.'' Means said despite the judge's decision, he still felt the state was trying to force him to return to school. `` I think they're trying to pressure me, to force me to enroll in a -LRB- high school equivalency -RRB- program. I do n't like being forced to do anything,'' he said. <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> said Means could retain his driving privileges permanently if he enrolls in an equivalency course and makes satisfactory progress. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who represents the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION>, said he was satisfied with the progress of the case. `` I was just worried that this would drag on through the courts until he turned 18,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` I think this allows for a quick resolution.'' <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> left the court room immediately after the judge stayed the suspension and was unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> argued that revoking the decision to suspend Mean's license would send the wrong message to teen-agers in similar situations `` It will encourage those people who want to avoid their responsibility to the state and to themselves,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. He argued that statistics show dropouts are less likely to be able to obtain jobs paying above the minimum wage. `` Maybe an education, some training, would help these people break this cycle, a cycle of poverty and lowered ambitions.'' <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, testified that after the law went into effect, 1,800 dropouts returned to school in the fall and 50 percent were still attending school in March. The state's recent dropout rate of around 17 percent is equivalent to 5,000 students, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The state expected to reduce the rate this year by 1,000 students as a direct result of the new law, she said. Several states, including <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> signed a dropout bill into law Friday, have passed similar legislation and others are considering such laws.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not plan further sanctions to punish <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for executing three people and hopes to preserve relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` if we possibly can,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said at the White House `` we deeply regret'' the executions, which were carried out in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> over pleas for clemency by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` We're very disappointed with the government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' He repeated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> calls for restraint. One day after adopting new sanctions and asking <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to spare the lives of demonstrators sentenced to death, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> muted its reaction to the executions. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said there was no plan to register a protest or to call in a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> diplomat. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside reporters' questions about the matter. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said sanctions and pleas for leniency have not swayed Chinese leaders. `` It's hard to suggest that there has been very much impact'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and it does not appear to have made much difference.'' He said `` history has shown that they generally are not that responsive to outside kinds of pleas.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in emphasizing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must continue to do business with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite international outrage over the country's bloody crackdown and suppression of pro-democracy forces. `` This is a country of a billion people and is a sizable portion of the world population that can not be closeted off and ignored,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, however, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said that in view of the executions and other `` barbaric'' acts, `` the president must and should consider taking further steps, particularly with respect to trade.'' `` There are times when what American stands for and believes in is more important than an economic benefit to be derived from a trade relationship,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, said he told Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> that economic sanctions are certain to be imposed if executions continue `` Much that has been built up in the last 10 years could be destroyed,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Han </PERSON> replied that actions by his government are `` internal matters'' and that he hoped the administration `` would be careful in not taking steps that would sever a relationship carefully nurtured over a decade.'' After prodding from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the White House announced Tuesday it was ending all high-level official contacts with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and attempting to postpone new loans from international banks, a step that could affect at least $ 1.4 billion for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, chief source of aid to Third World countries, said it already had suspended new loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, as of June 8, just days after Chinese troops killed hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> authorities executed three men who were convicted of setting fire to a train after it crashed through a barricade erected by pro-democracy demonstrators and killed six people. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not contemplating any additional action at this time'' against <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` There is an important relationship here which we should seek to preserve if we possibly can,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` That is a consideration that must be taken on board.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> commented to reporters outside the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as he escorted visiting West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietrich-Genscher </PERSON> to a luncheon. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> had been asked his reaction during a picture-taking session with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and began to reply that `` we are condemning the brutal. ...''

<HEAD>Bush Urged to Curb Trade with China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders Wednesday urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to consider curbing trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in an effort to end the executions of pro-democracy demonstrators. `` The president must and should consider taking further steps, particularly with respect to trade,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, calling the executions `` barbaric'' acts. `` I say that in full awareness that we benefit from trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` But there are times when what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stands for and believes in is more important than an economic benefit to be derived from a trade relationship.'' Three men were executed in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Wednesday and as many as 17 other people have been sentenced to death for their roles in the student-led protests earlier this month. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the Sentate Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee, said he told Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> in an hour-long conversation Wednesday that economic sanctions were certain if repression and executions continue `` Much that has been built up in the last 10 years could be destroyed,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` If the repression and executions continue much longer, the break will be irreparable.'' Han, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said, replied with `` the official line,'' stating that actions taken by his government are `` internal matters.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, introduced legislation to make it easier for Chinese students and scholars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to apply for asylum. He said the purpose of the legislation was to provide a safe haven for students who fear persecution if they return and to signal the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government `` that its repressive campaign will mean the loss of thousands of its best and brightest students.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said his bill would go beyond the step taken by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of authorizing a special immigration status permitting Chinese students to remain through June 5, 1990. An alternative bill was introduced by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis., and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., to permit Chinese students to renew their visas and apply for permanent residence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> There are more than 40,000 Chinese students attending American colleges and universities.

<HEAD>Cable Industry Has Become Monopoly, Senator, Others Claim</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A few major cable television operators are now the `` godfathers'' of the industry, exacting tribute from start-up companies and withholding programming from rural viewers, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel was told Wednesday. An increasingly prosperous cable industry has raised prices and stiff-armed microwave and home satellite dish companies that need programming, while growing into a `` cable Cosa Nostra'' that can do as it pleases without fear of regulation or competition, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said Since 1986, when a 1984 law deregulating cable was fully in place, only about six new cable program networks have been successful, and they all are at least partially owned by major cable system operators, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> communications subcommittee hearing on ownership of the cable TV industry. In the wake of deregulation, `` We have witnessed an extraordinary concentration of control and integration by cable operators and program services, manifesting itself in blatantly anticompetitive behavior towards those who would compete with existing cable operators for the right to distribute services,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. `` In the case of satellite dish owners, for example, program services have consistently refused to deal with distributors unless they are cable operators, shutting out almost all competition for a market that, ironically, cable itself has largely refused to serve,'' added <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who has introduced legislation that would re-regulate cable, allow telephone companies to compete in cable and require cable operators to provide access for all program services and delivery technologies. Wednesday's was the second in a series of three hearings on media ownership that have featured a virtual who's who of television industry executives. The hearings were spurred by increasing complaints to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of price hikes and poor service and of `` quick-buck'' buying and selling of cable systems. The `` horizontal concentration'' of a few companies has turned cable into a major TV force that enters more than half the nation's living rooms. At least a dozen bills are pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to re-regulate cable prices, try to induce competition or to slow the shift of TV sports to pay television. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, testified that there was `` great sensitivity'' in his industry to complaints but that cable has changed television for the better as it loosened the stranglehold of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and offered far more and better programming. Cable industry investment in new programming _ so-called vertical integration _ has spurred the cable boom and has not impeded the development of competing technologies or program services, <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Padden </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>, said that when <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> launched its new Consumer News and Business Channel earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reportedly paid the nation's largest cable system operator, <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, `` an estimated $ 20 million to buy or lease <ORGANIZATION> Tempo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> _ a cable service whose apparent assets would appear to have been negligible.'' `` That transaction has all the appearances of the payment of tribute for access through <ORGANIZATION> TCI </ORGANIZATION>'s concentrated monopoly subscriber base,'' <PERSON> Padden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> called it a `` shakedown'' by a `` godfather'' - like `` cable Cosa Nostra'' in which any new programming source first must get approval from a half-dozen major cable operators before it can even think of proceeding <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, subcommittee Chairman Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, and Sens. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, R.-S.D., and <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, R-Mont., expressed concern that their largely rural constituencies were being shortchanged by the cable industry's apparent reluctance to sell programs to microwave cable and home satellite dish users

<HEAD>Chemical Removed from Hazard List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday declared that sodium sulfate, which accounts for about half of the hazardous chemical releases by industry nationwide, is n't a toxic substance at all. Sodium sulfate is a widely used agent and byproduct in a variety of processes including the production of paper, glass and detergents. The chemical industry had petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to reclassify sodium sulfate arguing that there is no evidence the chemical poses a significant health threat. The action by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had been expected. The agency staff had earlier recommended that sodium sulfate be reclassified as being nontoxic `` due to an apparent absence of significant toxicity concerns'' about the chemical. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> petitions coordinator, said the reclassification was taken after the agency concluded that sodium sulfate `` did not meet the health and environmental toxicity criteria'' required by the law. The chemical is widely used in industry and accounted for nearly 54 percent of all the toxic chemicals releases into the air, water and soil during 1987, according to an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report eaerlier this week on releases by industry of 328 toxic chemicals. The agency said that more than 12 billion pounds of sodium sulfate were releases by industrial plants, most of it into surface water, during 1987. The absence of sodium sulfate from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> toxic chemical list will result in significant changes in the national profile on toxic releases, agency officials said. For example, the largest volume of sodium sulfate releases occurred in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, including 5.3 billion pounds from one plant, causing that state to lead every other state in toxic industrial chemical releases for 1987. Without sodium sulfate, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> would have ranked ninth, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Overall, 22.5 billion pounds of toxic releases were reported for 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report. But that volume is more than cut in half without sodium sulfate. Water discharges were the most common form of toxic chemical releases in 1987 largedly because three-fourths of all relases of sodium sulfate were into surface water. Without sodium sulfate, water releases would have ranked last.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> referred to his lover as his wife when she was pregnant with their child, according to a doctor's wife who testified Wednesday that she recognized the actor's voice from the movie `` Body Heat.'' <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Credle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, wife of Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Credle </PERSON>, an obstetrician, said Hurt called their house sometime after he arrived in the state in late October 1982 to film `` The Big Chill.'' Hurt was referring to dancer <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, 32, who was then about eight months pregnant with <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Devon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, now 6. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> claims a common-law marriage exists between her and Hurt under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> statutes. She says she now wants a `` divorce'' and up to half of everything he has earned in the past 6 -LCB- years. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, estimates Hurt's worth at $ 10 million. Mrs. <PERSON> Credle </PERSON> said she did not recognize <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s voice until he identified himself but then she remembered his voice from the movie `` Body Heat.'' `` Is this Mrs. Doctor?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Credle </PERSON> quoted Hurt as asking. She said she told him she was and <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> said, `` Can I speak to the doctor about my wife?'' She said she never met Hurt or <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' claim is based on four weeks she spent with Hurt in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, from Dec. 9, 1982, to Jan. 10, 1983, while he was filming `` The Big Chill.'' Hurt reportedly learned he was divorced from actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> on Dec. 9, 1982, after seven years of marriage. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> argues that from that day on, a common-law marriage has existed between her and Hurt although there was never a formal ceremony. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the two lived most of the time, does not recognize common-law marriages. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Credle </PERSON>'s testimony proved Hurt and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> were living as husband and wife in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, but since Mrs. <PERSON> Credle </PERSON> could not say for certain that the call came after Dec. 9, 1982, the value of her testimony is questionable. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON>, who is hearing the trial without a jury, must decide whether a common-law marriage exists. The judge has indicated that <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> will have a hard time proving her case. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> was on the stand part of Wednesday's court session for cross-examination, and Hurt's lawyer, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, showed that her testimony was sometimes inconsistent with earlier sworn statements. For example, she once said Hurt had her sign a prenuptial agreement on Dec. 3, 1982, in which she forfeited any claims to his money. She later testified she had learned they signed the agreement around Christmas that year. Hurt testified no agreement was ever signed. In a sworn affidavit, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> told her it would be unseemly for them to have a civil marriage ceremony with her being nine months pregnant and everybody thinking they were already married. In court Wednesday, she testified that Hurt had never said anything about a civil ceremony being unseemly. The trial is scheduled to resume Thursday.

Consultation with senators opposed to <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> has delayed the formal nomination, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, chief spokesman for Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> added that `` it is our expectation that Mr. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> will be nominated and confirmed'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> spoke with a number of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators who signed a letter last week urging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not to nominate <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>. He declined to identify those speaking with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. The letter was signed by 14 senators, including Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, the ranking <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It charged that <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> acted improperly when he chaired the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial screening panel by giving names of prospective nominees to liberal organizations which then used the information to mobilize opposition to the candidates. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> has said that the names were given to the organizations as part of an effort to determine if the candidates had a history of bias against women and minorities. Asked why <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not sent <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s name to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said `` there have been questions raised by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> concerning the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s role in the evaluating the professional qualificiations'' of judicial candidates. `` Some discussions have been going on'' regarding <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s role at the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said.

The event, held on the grounds of the Methodist church where <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> had been the night they were killed by <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansmen </PERSON>, showed that `` <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are far different places than they were 25 years ago,'' Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. More than 1,000 people sat in folding chairs placed in the reddish dust on the church grounds with the hot June sun bearing down on the nearly three-hour ceremony. Attending the ecumenical service at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Methodist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> were relatives of the three slain men and 470 people from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> whose `` <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Project,'' bus caravan arrived Tuesday in nearby Meridian. `` This is a bittersweet moment for me,'' said <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>'s widow. `` Sad because it recalls personal pain, but good because I have the opprtunity _ after all this time _ to say hello again to many people whose kindess and courage were beyond explaining.'' The church has special significance for the civil rights struggle in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> because it is where <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> had gone to investigate a fire the day they were killed by <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klansmen </PERSON>. The service was part of a daylong series of activities in rural eastern <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> on Wednesday's 25th anniversary of the murders. A couple of hours before the service, about 200 people crowded into tiny <LOCATION> Okatibbee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> was buried. <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> were white civil rights volunteers from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> was a young black man from <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>. They were murdered by white racists in neighboring <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The slayings and attempted coverup by <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials outraged the nation. It also was a dramatic and tragic beginning to the so-called `` Mississippi Freedom Summer Project,'' which brought young people from the North pouring into the state. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation revealed <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> were killed by members of the Klan. Their bodies were buried in an earthen dam near <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said state officials hoped to use the event to show the world there have been many positive changes in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> since the bloody summer of 1964. `` We intend to send a message to the nation that the only thing burning in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> today is a desire for a better life for all our people,'' <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said, in an oblique reference to the movie `` Mississippi Burning.'' <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> did not bring murder charges in the case. However, 19 Mississipians, most from the Meridian and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> areas, were prosecuted under federal statutes for violating the victims' civil rights. Seven men eventually were convicted and an eighth pleaded guilty. Their prison sentences ranged from three to 10 years prison but the most any ever served was six years.

<TEXT>
 A former federal security agent and onetime movie actor said Wednesday he was part of a team that killed newspaper columnist <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> in 1984, but he maintained he does not know who ordered the killing. The <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> attorney general's office had police arrest ex-agent <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> on Tuesday and produced him at a news conference the next day. <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> said he was in a squad that killed <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>, but said he did not know what the operation was about. `` I'm a career policeman, not a criminal nor a killer,'' <PERSON> Mora </PERSON>, 36, a member of a prominent political family, told reporters. He said the triggerman was a police informer named <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonso </PERSON>, nicknamed `` El Chocorrol'' _ a type of chocolate _ because of his dark complexion. He said the man died two months ago. <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON>, whose front-page column in the newspaper Excelsior exposed wrongdoing in high places, was fatally shot May 30, 1984, at the entrance of a parking garage near his office. <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> said he, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and a police officer met at the now-dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, similar to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the afternoon <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> was killed, and set out on motorcycles on a secret operation to silence a troublemaker. He said he remembered hearing shots but did not witness the killing. `` I did n't know what was happening,'' <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> told reporters. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> <PERSON> Uzcanga </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> as saying that after the shooting, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> shouted to him, `` Let's go!'' and they rode away together. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> then left <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> a few blocks later, <PERSON> Polo </PERSON> added. He quoted <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> as saying he saw <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, director of security administration, when he returned to the scene of the shooting a few minutes later. <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> insisted he did not know who ordered the killing. <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> was first on the scene, minutes after <PERSON> Buendia </PERSON> was shot, and conducted the first investigation into the case. He was arrested June 13 in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and awaits trial on charges of homicide, obstructing justice and abuse of authority. The attorney general's office called <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON>, 47, the mastermind of the crime and said it is presenting evidence to prove <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> ordered the killing of <LOCATION> Buendia </LOCATION> _ his friend of 15 years _ when he got wind of the columnist's intention to expose his links to prominent drug traffickers. <PERSON> Zorrilla </PERSON> was director of the security administration from 1982 until the government dissolved it for widespread corruption in 1985. The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> is the grandson of former <LOCATION> Puebla </LOCATION> state Gov. <PERSON> Maximino </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, a onetime Secretary of Communications and Transportation. It said he was also a grandnephew of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, who was president of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from 1940 to 1946. <PERSON> Mora </PERSON> played piano for a rock music group and did bit parts as an actor in at least four horror and crime B-movies.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> on Wednesday told delegations from 127 nations that the `` economic totalitarianism'' of the developed world is crushing an increasingly restive Third World. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, in a welcoming speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of 77, praised the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan as an important initiative for relieving the burden of a $ 1.3 trillion debt on the Third World. `` But we impatiently wait for the concrete gains ... in light of our urgent situation,'' said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s efforts to impose austerity measures in his country, backed by international creditors, prompted riots in February that killed about 300 people. Similar riots were reported in May in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, another large contributor to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s $ 401 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said 40 countries in the underdeveloped world _ with a combined population of more than 800 million _ faced severe financial problems because of the debt. He said that since 1982, those countries signed up to 90 restructuring agreements with banks, but the banks never agreed to interest rates at or below market rates. `` When we speak of that economic totalitarianism that is forced on us ... we refer to insensitive attempts to relegate our economic and social development to immediate needs of fiscal balance in order to assure the payment of the debt,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. The plan proposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on March 10 encourages banks to forgive a substantial portion of their loans to heavily indebted countries in return for guarantees that the rest will be paid. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> would furnish the guarantees. The <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan also calls for economic reforms in debtor countries in order to receive the benefits of reductions in the debt. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said developed countries call for belt-tightening for the poor when they lived beyond their means `` at the expense of the rest of the world.'' He castigated the industrialized nations for basing their growth on `` the destruction of the environment along with an immoral export of toxic wastes to the Third World.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> made calls to the Group of 77 to renew the commitment to economic cooperation within the underdeveloped world, saying such efforts had flagged under the strain of the debt crisis. The group, a non-aligned organization within the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> system, was formed 25 years ago to give underdeveloped nations a forum to push for changes in the international economy. Originally comprised of 77 member nations, the group officially admitted <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> as its 128th member Wednesday. The group, meeting until Friday, is expected to call for a better economic conditions in the light of the increasing impoverishment of the underdeveloped world and increased economic cooperation between the underdeveloped nations, said <PERSON> Muchkund </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubey </PERSON>, permanent secretary of economic affairs of the Indian Foreign Ministry.

 Activists who fought a clash between patriotism and creativity stemming from an art student's floor display of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag hailed Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision clearing a flag-burning protester. Some <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lawmakers, however, said they'll fight on for a law to punish improper displays of the flag. The high court, voting 5-4, threw out the conviction of a protester sentenced to a year in jail and fined $ 2,000 for burning the flag in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The court said the flag-burning at a demonstration in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> during the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form of expression protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech. One <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> activist said the ruling will discourage passage of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> proposals to prohibit displaying the flag on the floor, but a sponsor of such a proposal says the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case may have little relevance to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> legislation. `` Hopefully, it -LRB- the ruling -RRB- will have some impact on the broader questions of censorship so prevalent today,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> No-Mandatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` No doubt the reactionaries are not all going to go home,'' he added. `` I think people really need to continue this fight.'' The committee was formed in support of <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, a student at the School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, who provoked angry protests by displaying a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag in a work that critics said invited desecration by encouraging viewers to trample Old Glory. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, 24, was less optimistic about the impact of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. `` All these laws are going to pass. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> they already have,'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said, referring to an ordinance, enacted the day the exhibit that included his work was closed, making it illegal to display a flag on the floor. State Sen. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON>, sponsor of a state measure to make it a felony to display the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag on the floor, said: `` I've spoken to one attorney who says that the decision regarding the flag case in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is quite different from the one in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. ... We're not sure yet at all if there is an impact.'' The School of the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> stood behind <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> and his work during its display in February and March, maintaining that First Amendment rights were at stake. `` We were n't overly surprised at the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- decision,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ter </PERSON> <PERSON> Molen </PERSON>, vice president of development and affairs for the Art Institute of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We certainly hope that people in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, especially, Senator <PERSON> Dudycz </PERSON>, take this into consideration.'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s work, titled `` What is the Proper Way to Display a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Flag,'' included a flag spread on the floor in front of a book soliciting comments from viewers. Also part of the work was a montage of photographs, some showing flag-draped coffins and South Koreans burning the flag.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Republicans, seeking to keep the ethics high ground against the Democrats, took the unprecedented step Wednesday of triggering an investigation of one of their own: Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The action on <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who was convicted last month on charges involving sex with a 16-year-old girl, came on a show of hands in a closed-door meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the organization of all <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., sought in a statement to portray the move as part of a Republican `` total commitment to standards of behavior for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which reflect honorably on the institution and the nation. However, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said the Republicans seemed to be trying to score `` a political point ... apparently at the expense of one of their own members. He said any <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attempt to make ethics a partisan issue was `` absolute nonsense and the public knows it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethic committee, formally the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, had been expected to investigate <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> anyway. If the committee finds him to have violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules it could recommend penalties ranging from a reprimand to expulsion. Republicans have set ethics reform in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> among their top priorities for the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. And their political operatives hope to capitalize in the next elections by pointing to the resignations of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the face of ethics allegations. But <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' conviction on May 30 in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, of contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a minor, has been an embarrassment to his own party. A jury found <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> guilty of the misdemeanor charge based on its conclusion that he had sex with the girl at his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment last November. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, 58 and divorced, is appealing the conviction. One member of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, sought to use Wednesday's move to turn up the heat on Democrats, suggesting they might do well to put the ethics spotlight on their own bad apples. `` We have taken that step of asking for an investigation,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` I think it's an appropriate kind of step to suggest that the other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of tough thing that is involved in what our conference did today.'' Newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> retorted when told of <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s comment: `` I'm sure Democrats are prepared to kick out their own members who are convicted of sexually abusing children.'' Although <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> has announced he will seek re-election, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has said he will not be on the party's ticket in 1990, and the senior member of the state's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> delegation, Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, has said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> `` should do the gentlemanly thing and resign.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to fight, and his spokesman said Wednesday's action was welcome because an ethics probe could `` once and for all bring forth the truth about this entire episode. The spokesman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was hampered in court because he was not permitted to cast doubt on the motives and credibility of the girl and her mother, who were <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' accusers. `` Now we'll be able to bring forth the background and the motives,'' he said. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> learned Wednesday that a polyp removed from his colon was benign. Spokesman <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was in good health and the throat cancer diagnosed in 1984 remains in remission. In presenting the Republican resolution, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said it was unprecedented for the conference to call for an ethics probe of one of its own members. The document asks the ethics panel to `` determine whether Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> `` Buz'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> failed to conduct himself at all times in a manner which reflects creditably on the House of Representatives.'' It notes that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, `` in order to perform their constitutional duties, must conduct themselves with integrity'' and that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules require conduct which will not bring disrepute on the institution. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> will live up to its constitutional obligation to police its own members `` no matter how distasteful or painful.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, continuing to trumpet his theme of volunteerism, called Wednesday for more Americans to donate time to help protect national parks and other natural resources. `` It is time to renew our commitments, both to nature and to our fellow man,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a convention of recreational vehicle owners. He spoke to a crowd of several thousand people. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, offering no new specifics, outlined to the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> the environmental proposals he has submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We need to get the word out, that our national parks and other federal land management agencies depend on volunteers,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` This is just the kind of voluntary, local effort it will take to bring us into a better partnership with nature.'' After speaking at a muddy fairgrounds, the president addressed a crowd of some 2,000 Republicans at a $ 100-a-plate unity banquet. Praising Republican <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> for his gubernatorial primary victory, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> jokingly offered <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> some `` free advice.'' `` Do n't film your TV ads riding around in a tank,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, referring to an ad made by Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequently made fun of during his election campaign last year. The president said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> would be `` a battleground between the parties in the 1990s'' and called <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> `` a trailblazer.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> won a hard-fought <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary last week by defeating former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON>. He will face Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> in November. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary a `` rough and tumble competition,'' but said `` now that the dust has settled, we are all still Republicans.'' `` We will take our <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> message _ a message of hope and opportunity _ to the black and other minority voters of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in comments apparently designed to undercut support for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, who could become the nation's first elected black governor. In his speech to the motor coach group, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought support for his environmental proposals to increase federal spending on recreational land acquisition by $ 200 million in 27 states, and for a like amount in new funding for wetlands acquisition. On another program, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his administration would identify by the end of the week 25 new `` back-country byways'' for federal protection to add to the existing 43 National Forest Scenic Byways. `` I want to preserve ... those picturesque roads that offer power views of the nation's natural splendor,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 A commuter is suing the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> for $ 20.35 because its discount tokens were always sold out, and when he did manage to buy some, they sold him a slug. `` If you've got a mule, the only way you can get it to do something is to get its attention first,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlichtman </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I'm filing the suit to get their attention, then I'm going to get them to do something _ give me the money they owe me. Five times last week he tried to buy rolls of tokens for the Garden State Parkway at the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> toll plaza, and every time he was told they were sold out, he said. A roll of 40 tokens costs $ 10, a savings of $ 4. Beginning next month $ 10 will buy only 30 tokens. The 35 cents demanded in the suit is for a slug <PERSON> Schlichtman </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> sold him in a roll of tokens he was able to buy. A toll collector refused to reimburse him for the slug, he said. <PERSON> Schlichtman </PERSON>'s says his case is solid. He collected receipts every time he was told there were no tokens and he has the names of the toll booth employees. <PERSON> Schlichtman </PERSON>, a South Orange resident who works in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said he spends about $ 1,000 a year on highway tolls. `` Toll booths are a major part of my life,'' he said. `` I spend more time sitting at toll booths than I do with any other part of my day. They're ridiculous and obnoxious.'' <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingoglia </PERSON> said the agency would not comment on the case because it was in litigation. But he said motorists who are sold slugs can either mail the slugs to the Highway Authority for a refund, or get a refund at a toll plaza administration building. Toll collectors are not permitted to make refunds, he said.

The liquidations, signed by acting <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Wadico </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucchi </PERSON>, also included the brokerages <PERSON> Ney </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvalho </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Celton </LOCATION>, Titular and Beta. The five houses ran up a debt equivalent to $ 64 million. <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>, 42, the No. 1 investor in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 30 billion stock market, bounced checks worth $ 31 million to several brokerages used to purchase stock futures, said the <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> had borrowed heavily to invest in blue-chip stocks, taking advantage of a rule that allowed him to pay five days later, said the commission, which is the rough equivalent to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, he pumped up the stock's price by buying large amounts of common stock, meaning the shares he received later were worth more. When banks restricted credit for that type of operation, <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>' checks to several brokerages were returned for lack of funds. A judge in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, the nation's financial center, on Tuesday rejected a request by a prosecutor for the arrest of <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON>, ruling there was not enough evidence to show he was responsible for stock manipulation. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has barred <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> from leaving the country. There are nine stock exchanges in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> had been playing principally on the Rio market. <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> are the principal exchanges. The Monday after the scandal broke on June 9th, the commission declared a one-day stock market holiday to prevent panic among investors, but the government refused to bail out the brokerages or the Rio Exchange. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janeiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcellos </PERSON> announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence. The scandal prompted an investigation of 29 brokerages by the commission. The markets began to recover Tuesday from a week-long tailspin that saw share prices plunge by more than 34 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Rio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose 10.5 percent and the <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> exchanges closed up 15.3 percent. On Wednesday, the Rio exchange fell by 0.1 percent, while in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> the market closed up 3.9 percent.

 A privately financed group studying preparations for the Nicaraguan election questioned Wednesday whether the council appointed by the Sandinista government to oversee the campaign and balloting will be fair. The <ORGANIZATION> Bipartisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Free and Fair Elections said the appointment of <PERSON> Mariano </PERSON> <PERSON> Faillos </PERSON>, a member of the ruling party, as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> `` raises questions about the independence'' of the five-member panel. In addition, the group said, it `` would have improved the composition'' of the body if both of the two members representing the political opposition had been drawn from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s `` Group of 14'' opposition parties. Instead, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> nominated and the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> appointed <PERSON> Aman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to one of the two slots. Leaders of the `` Group of 14'' do not recognize the Democratic Conservatives as an opposition party, but consider them allied with the governing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, the commission said, <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON> is considered a dissident in his own party and `` some say this proves <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>'s sufficient independence'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` Given these perspectives, it is uncertain at this point whether the five appointments are balanced and fair,'' the commission said. <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, co-chairman of the commission, who was ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said the commission hopes to meet with the electoral council soon and has applied for visas to enter <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> sometime this summer. On June 12, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of trying to restrict foreign monitoring of the balloting by requiring Americans _ for the first time _ to acquire entry visas as of July 1. The commission released letters it has written to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> asking for an opportunity to brief them on its work. Former Sen. <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, D-Wis., the other co-chairman of the commission, said the group would request a meeting with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and had begun efforts to meet with other Central American presidents <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said a number of trips to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> were planned, beginning in late July or early August and continuing through the elections that are to be held in February under an agreement between <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the governments of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, press officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said she assumed the visas would be granted, but `` the official position is that the only people who will be allowed to be observers are those that have been invited to be observers by the government.'' `` There is really no restrictions on the visas, unless someone is really undesirable,'' Ms. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. `` There is no new qualification that people must go through simply because they are Americans.'' Ms. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said the embassy had not yet received a copy of the commission's report. The commission said its proposals were `` but the minimal requirements for a free and fair electoral campaign and election.'' `` They are consistent with Central American practices and are by no means ideal standards or an attempt to impose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> practices on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' the panel said. The commission, which held hearings here May 9-11, is sponsored by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The group said that `` international observers, press, and broadcast media must have the right to travel throughout the country during the campaign to monitor the electoral process.'' It said polling must be permitted, there must be `` reasonable opposition access'' to press, radio and television, and laws giving the government censorship and control over media outlets must be suspended during the campaign. It proposed that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which has no voter registration system, establish one by the beginning of the campaign on Sept. 1. Although few countries in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> allow absentee voting, the commission said a significant number of Nicaraguans now live abroad in exile and `` fairness calls for some form of participation by these people in deciding their homeland's future.''

 After years of touring the world, winning rave reviews in dozens of languages and being the first major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ballet company to tour the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the Dance Theater of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> opened its 20th anniversary season Wednesday night with a performance of `` Giselle.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, executive director and co-founder of the company, spoke before the start of the perfomance, thanking the City Center audience for its support and the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a $ 2.5 million grant that will be used to renovate the <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> facility and other properties. `` The fact that we have survived and gotten here in 20 years is a miracle,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Dancer-choreographer-actor-designer <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON> and his wife, the dancer <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLavallade </PERSON>, congratulated <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and the company during opening ceremonies to celebrate the anniversary. Holder said the company was `` an inspired idea'' and that <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had a lot of courage. `` <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> is a gem cutter,'' said Miss DeLavallade. `` He went into a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> garage with all these wonderful jewels and formed a crown and placed it in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>.'' Two decades ago, the talented and brash principal dancer from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> sliced through the racial barriers that had kept blacks from succeeding in classical ballet and founded the vibrant and youthful company. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who retired from the City Ballet in 1970, has led the troupe to international renown, but has kept its roots firmly planted in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. The original dance school remains in the primarily black uptown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> neighborhood, and many of this season's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> performances will be held in <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The Dance Theater of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> prides itself on preserving American dance repertory, and does an excellent job of presenting works that otherwise would disappear because they are not performed. The company also demonstrates a variety of styles and moods, from the classical `` Swan Lake'' to the neoclassical `` Serenade'' to the contemporary and ethnic `` Dougla'' to the folk ballet `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>.'' Last year, the troupe captivated audiences in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with its magical retelling of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taras </PERSON>' stunning `` Firebird,'' set to the original <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON> score. The company's `` Giselle,'' which had its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> premiere in 1984 after a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> debut, is a departure from the traditional work set in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. This `` Giselle'' takes place in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in the years following the Civil War. It is as creole as crawfish and gumbo, and just as luscious with its mossy sets and pastel costumes. <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who danced with the Ballet Russe de <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> from the 1930s -'50s, staged the ballet for the company without departing too much from the choreography by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Coralli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> The lithe <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the company's prima ballerina, danced the title role of the young woman who dies of unrequited love. She was partnered with <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shellman </PERSON>, who is paired with her in many of the company's works. <PERSON> Shellman </PERSON>, whose barrel turns and leaps have made him a stand-out in the troupe, portrayed the callous suitor, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> displayed a wonderful technical astuteness en pointe. And <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrus </PERSON>, who will dance the lead on June 25, was perky and refreshing in her pas de deux with <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>. During its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> run through July 2, the Dance Theater of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> will perform works from its repertoire, including <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s `` Allegro Brillante,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s `` Holberg Suite'' and <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tetley </PERSON>'s `` Voluntaries.'' The company also will premiere works by <LOCATION> Nijinska </LOCATION>.

 Rock' n' roll relics are dusting off their guitars and banging their drums quickly for a spate of reunion tours this summer, starting with Wednesday's debut of The Who talking ` bout their generation The Who, which splintered after a `` farewell tour'' in 1982, reassembled at the small <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> arena with a series of songs from the nearly two-decade-old rock opera, `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>.'' The Who is just one group planning a revival in the coming months. The Rolling Stones will be touring this fall and former Beatle <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> is going on his first solo tour, as will veterans like <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> and former Band members. Other bands from the 1970s that had long since broken up, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Allman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, are planning reunion tours. The Who have scheduled concerts in 36 stadiums across the country this summer in a tour marking the band's 25th anniversary. They'll also do two special charity performances of `` Tommy'' at indoor venues in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> It all started Wednesday when <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON>, dressed in a baggy gray suit with his hair swept back in a ponytail, grimaced as he sang a high note in `` 1921,'' one of `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>'s'' opening songs. A crowd of slightly more than 5,000 roared when singer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON> shattered one pair of tambourines and then tossed it aside. A giant video screen designed for stadiums beamed close-ups of the band and a series of colorful flags stitched together served as a stage backdrop. In a three-hour show, The Who performed their classics `` Who Are You,'' `` Substitute,'' `` My Generation,'' `` Wo n't Get Fooled Again,'' and `` <PERSON> Baba </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Riley </PERSON>.'' They played 38 songs and two acts. A June 23 show in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, the city where the band played its last show in 1982, was originally scheduled to be the tour opener. But the band added Wednesday night's performance as a warm up. The band's tour has been criticized by some in the music community, who note that members <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON> have n't had nearly the same financial success with individual tours and records as they did with The Who. The cover of the current Musician magazine, for instance, shows a drawing of the three band members as the centerpiece of a large dollar bill. Tickets sales have indeed been brisk. Tickets here sold out within 82 minutes of being offered for sale. The three remaining original members of the band were supplemented by drummer <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, keyboard player <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundrick </PERSON> and guitarist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>. The band has no new album out but they plan to release the record `` The Iron Man'' next month.

 A moderate earthquake was felt in a wide area of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> late Wednesday afternoon, but there were no reports of damages or injuries. The temblor had a magnitude estimated at 4.2 on the Richter scale by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>. Its epicenter was in <LOCATION> Pittsburg </LOCATION>, about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` You may get a few things knocked off of shelves, but that's about all that's going to happen,'' said <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> seismologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhrhammer </PERSON> Telephone interviews indicated the quake was felt in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> north to <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION> and as far east as <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>. `` The whole house seemed like it briefly shifted,'' said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarpelli </PERSON>, who lives in a house on stilts in the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> hills. `` It seemed like someone took a hammer to the house.''

<HEAD>Military Agrees on Talks to End Political Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The military has agreed to participate in talks toward ending the political crisis involving <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the government said Wednesday. The military will be included in the government delegation, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The talks among the government, military and opposition were proposed last week by an <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mission, which has made two trips to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since the government annulled a May election that foreign observers said the opposition won handily. The government had insisted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the country's de facto leader, was `` not negotiable.'' But Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, which included excerpts from <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>'s letter, made no mention of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>'s letter was apparently an effort to circumvent a deadlock caused by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>' insistence the military had nothing to do with politics. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had said talks to resolve the crisis should be between the government and the opposition. Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>'s government reiterates `` its decision to take part in a dialogue between Panamanians to try overcome the grave problems confronting'' the nation, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>'s letter said The government will be represented by `` the executive branch, which includes the Defense Forces,'' it added. In the letter, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> indicated the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> should help draw up an agenda for the talks `` on the basis of a concensus among those taking part ... to serve as a basis for discussion of the Panamanian nation's problems.'' Opposition groups demanding that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> step down said last week they were willing to take part in the talks. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in 1988 by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Efforts by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to oust him, including economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, have failed. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the legislature, which he controlled, fire President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> in February 1988, a day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The legislature then named Education Minister <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> acting president, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has insisted on recognizing <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s legitimate president. The crisis deepened when the government claimed its candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> won the presidential election May 7. Opposition groups and foreign observers including several from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said there was widespread fraud in the election and that the opposition candidate, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Andara </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, won by a 3-to-1 margin. As the crisis grew, a government-controlled election board annulled the election. The government had planned to install the new president on Sept. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>, called in to try solve the crisis, sent a delegation of top diplomats late in May, then a second one last week, to try and get the government, the military and the opposition to negotiate. The delegation, headed by <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, included foreign ministers <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Palencia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sahadeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Basdeo </PERSON> of Trinidad-Tobago.

 Chinese students across the nation have sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> urging stricter sanctions against their homeland, and to express their impatience with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration's response to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> killings `` What bothers me is not what is being done, but what is being said,'' said <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> <PERSON> Min </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>, a graduate student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who helped draft the letter. `` Secretary of State -LRB- James A. -RRB- <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> says we should treat this relationship as a very important one to preserve.

The letter, co-signed by Chinese student organizations from 68 American universities _ including <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s alma mater _ and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION>, says economic and diplomatic sanctions against the hard-line <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government can be as effective as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions were against <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist regime. `` -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- should now take the lead in promoting ` universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms' by themselves imposing sanctions against the goverment of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and by urging <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies to do the same,'' the letter said The organizations that signed it represent more than 7,000 Chinese students, said <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>, who Tuesday appeared before <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on international banking and outlined the letter's proposed economic <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>, a 31-year-old political science student, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is outdated despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s personal interest in the country where he formerly served as ambassador. `` The relationship was built on a common fear of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>. `` The threat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has diminished a great deal toward the West and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and has disappeared against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The letter calls for the following steps if the Chinese government does not `` cease and desist from further atrocities'': _ The removal of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s `` Most Favored Nation'' trade status _ Freezing all credit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> _ Reimposing restrictions on exports to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` These sanctions must remain in place until martial law is lifted and all reprisals against the leaders and supporters of the pro-democracy moveent are terminated,'' the letter said. If <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continues to arrest the demonstrators and does not commute the death sentences imposed on some, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students propose: _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should call for emergency sessions of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> _ Ending all credit guarantees against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ Suspension of the procession of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s application to membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the intertional trade body On Wednesday, the Chinese government executed three men for their roles in the student-led protests that ended when the army moved against students and supporters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4, killing up to 3,000 people, according to some estimates.

 Police fired tear gas and beat protesters with truncheons to break up a rally Wednesday by hundreds of students demanding that private tuition fees be rolled back, witnesses said. At least 11 students were arrested. Witnesses said they saw scores of protesters hit in the head and other parts of the body during the baton charge, but there were no immediate reports of serious injuries. Police charged the demonstrators, who numbered about 2,000, when they ignored repeated warnings to disperse peacefully after their permit to hold a rally in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> expired at 6 p.m., the witnesses said. Police said they planned to release the 11 arrested students after an investigation to determine if they should be charged with illegal assembly, a misdemeanor. The students were protesting a 15 percent tuition increase at private schools this month, the beginning of the school year. With the increase, annual tuition runs $ 95 on average for private elementary and high schools and about $ 145 at colleges. Per capita income in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is about $ 600 a year.

 Federal investigators have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to retrieve a cargo door that tore off a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jet over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> nearly four months ago, sending nine passengers to their deaths. The door is believed to be resting on the ocean floor more than three miles underwater and about 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which would share in the cost, said they support the recovery effort. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to search for the door, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said Tuesday.

 American and Soviet mountaineers who plan to climb <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> to promote peace and environmentalism met their Chinese counterparts Wednesday, and tried to sidestep questions about <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s troubles. `` We do n't know a lot about politics, but I think we all know a little bit about mountain climbing,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> Day 20 International Peace Climb, told a news conference at the <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We come here for the peace of the world,'' <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation leader <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> said through an interpreter. `` We hope to have good cooperation.'' Chinese mountaineers in the 30-member climbing team were delayed more than a week in reaching the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for practice climbing on <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainier </ORGANIZATION> because of restrictions on travel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> following the military crackdown there. The team, comprised of 10 citizens of each country, plans to head for <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rainier </LOCATION> on Saturday after planning sessions and a fund-raising reception. <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> said the team will train at least through Tuesday at a base camp and a high-level camp that have been established on the 14,410-foot peak 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The climb next year is intended to show that people from the three nations can work together to reach the highest point on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, who in 1963 became the first American to stand atop <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>. He said it's the first time mountaineers from the three countries have joined in a major climb. `` We will stand on the summit of <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>, three people, one from each country, with our arms around each other because we are brothers, not only under one sun, but brothers as mountain climbers,'' he said. The group will try to get as many climbers as possible to the summit of the 29,028-foot Himalayan mountain, he added. The mountaineers hope to get the first team onto the peak on April 22, the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> said. The expedition plans to pack its own trash down the mountain and bring out as much trash from previous climbs as possible. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> and other environmental groups have volunteered to help remove waste, <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> said. The climbers plan to approach the mountain's north side through <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. The cost of the expedition was put at $ 1 million, and <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> said additional sponsors were being sought. Pressed about the turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> said he welcomed the publicity it drew to the expedition. `` We'd like the events of the past few weeks to focus on this group of citizens that are working together for a common goal of peace, and the human environment,'' he said. `` I think there is even more reason for this group to be together. We had no idea that those problems would occur.'' But, <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON> said, the expedition `` is even more important for the citizens of this world ... When we rope up on that mountain we are trusting our lives to each other. I think we have to do that as countries.'' The <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> delegation leader said the Chinese recognize the American and Soviet climbers are more experienced. `` We will be the pupils.'' Soviet leader <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatayev </PERSON> said he was eager to get back to mountain climbing. `` We're happy our Chinese friends have come to climb,'' he said through an interpreter.

 More than 42,000 coal miners in 10 states took part in wildcat strikes Wednesday that spread in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Reports of violence and blockades mounted as coal companies sought relief from the courts. `` It looks like the bulk of the industry is shut down,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Pensoneau </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. More than 7,000 miners in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and 700 in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> joined the wildcat strike Wednesday in sympathy with about 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members striking <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. More than 4,000 additional workers in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> also walked off the job. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> hit six <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> locals with fines of $ 2,500 each for defying a back-to-work order sought by <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> judge fined the union $ 300,000 for violating his rules on picketing. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, three coal companies filed complaints against <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members in a bid to get miners back to work. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> police said there have been sporadic reports of minor violence in the state's southern coal fields in the past few days. Several hundred <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members refusing to work converged on the southern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coal fields and used convoy tactics to block the entrances to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> processing plants. More than 200 cars and pickups drove up and down the roads in front of the plant entrances. In addition, about 800 camouflage-clad coal miners from a half-dozen states converged on the state Capitol in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to pledge support for the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strikers. There still was no indication when the unauthorized walkouts might end, even though three jailed strike organizers were released in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on Tuesday and a two-week vacation period is scheduled to start for thousands of miners at midnight Friday. `` It's just a day-by-day thing,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, an incoming executive board member of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, W.Va.-based District 17. `` As far as what might happen down the road there's just nobody that can predict that.'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said miners are upset with huge fines levied against the union in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the lack of negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> and the UMW. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a strike that had been limited to a <LOCATION> Wabash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Couny </LOCATION> mine owned by <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spread to at least 40 sites, affecting 12 major coal companies, union officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> miners failed to show for work at the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidary with operations in four counties, while another 120 failed to show at <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Simco </ORGANIZATION> mine. More than 100 miners showed up at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> fined the six locals. In addition, he threatened to fine the locals $ 500 apiece for each day they fail to comply with the back-to-work order. He also fined the locals' officers $ 200 and each union member $ 50, with the penalties to increase by $ 50 a day for each day they remain in violation <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> international executive board member, said the 190 <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> miners showed up for work Tuesday but encountered pickets and refused to cross the line. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> asked a federal judge to find miners striking two locations in contempt for disobeying a back-to-work order. The strike has affected about 240 Old Ben Coal workers. In <LOCATION> Tazewell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Circuit Judge N.E. <PERSON> Persin </PERSON> ruled the union was responsible for picket line misconduct that resulted in coal trucks being the targets of objects thrown at several coal operations. About 100 miners converged on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Consolidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was seeking a back-to-work order for miners at six union locals in north central <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Consolidation officials have indicated they plan similar action for wildcat sites in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

 Along <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s marshy coast, it's always been hard to tell where the land ends and the water begins. But the line is changing; about an acre of rich marshland sinks under water every 15 minutes. And the problem is n't confined to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, as reported in the first story of a two-part series, `` Disappearing Wetlands.''

 From <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to the rocky coast of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, what's left of the nation's wetlands and barrier islands is disappearing. Nowhere is it going faster than in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, where 30 to 50 square miles of marshy coastline wash away every year. Shrimp fishermen pull trawls over the Port Eads schoolyard where <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Duet </PERSON>, 73, used to play. Water 4 feet deep covers the 160-acre farm near <LOCATION> Galliano </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Billiot </PERSON>, 51, lived as a child. A 200-year-old oak tree stands dying on land near <LOCATION> Theriot </LOCATION> bought in 1840 by the great-grandfather of <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marmande </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Salt water, once more than a quarter-mile off, has eaten away the marshes and now soaks the tree's roots <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, with 40 percent of the nation's remaining coastal wetlands, suffers 80 percent of the annual loss. Its fragile marshes are the nurturing grounds for a yearly seafood harvest worth almost $ 1 billion, the habitat for 40 percent of the country's fur-bearing animals and the wintering home for nearly 5 million migratory birds. About half of <LOCATION> Louisana </LOCATION>'s marshes have disappeared since World War II, wiped out by such natural forces as hurricanes and by levees and dams. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the nation's worst oil spill has devastated long stretches of coastline. But the Alaskan wetlands, however damaged, remain. Eventually, they will renew themselves. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> marshes are gone, quietly, without drama, without nightly newscasts, without crowds of volunteers. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wetlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Slidell </LOCATION>, an arm of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` People in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, when I've had the occasion to speak over there, have said, ` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the most developed, the most forward-looking, the brightest country in the world. How could you let this happen?' `` The simple truth is that we did n't know, 40 years ago, that it was going to happen. A lot of the things that started this occurred 40 years ago, and we did n't have the ability to forecast the effects.'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON>, a biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, said it was only recently that the Corps began considering the environment as important as flood control and navigation. In addition, <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said, `` It was n't until 1969 that the National Environmental Policy Act ... imposed a system for rigorous environmental examination of federal projects and activities. `` Many decisions were made long before that. Tremendous investments, the whole <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> tributaries project, all of the oil and gas exploration and investment that are now regulated, were not regulated to that degree back in the 1940s and 1950s when these things started popping. `` I'm not saying all of those decisions are irreversible, but many of them are irreversible _ commitments of resources and decisions made in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> before the implications were ever imagined.'' The scope of the problem is enormous. For one thing, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s 400-mile-long coast translates to almost 7,000 miles of shore when the dips, juts and loops of bays, inlets and peninsulas are included For another, the Biblical separation of earth and water never quite took hold in coastal <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, and solid objects tend to sink in the marshes that merge with the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` I can not find any coastal marsh loss rate higher than that of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> anywhere,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. But he also emphasized the problem was not confined to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has lost about 54 percent of its wetlands since settlement,'' he said. `` There have also been great losses in the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has lost 90 percent of its wetlands. ... `` You see the same thing in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Go around the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast, and you see the same thing. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> are undergoing tremendous change, largely because of human impact. `` <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>? The same sort of thing, but to a lesser degree. It's really a more stable coastline, so you do n't have the subsidence you have here ... You have losses in <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The net is a loss in all of those areas.'' The decisions that affected <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> were made with clear logic and compelling motives but no consideration of long-range harm. A strong young nation tamed its biggest river system with dams and levees, first making it a reliable transportation artery, then keeping it from overflowing. Nobody pondered how the marshes would live without replenishment from silt-laden fresh water. A vigorous oil industry moved into <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s marshes and the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 50 years ago, dredging canals to get drilling rigs to the oil and to lay pipe to offshore fields. Nobody considered the effects of saltwater canals through freshwater marshes. And when 27 sets of locks and dams were built on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and a giant irrigation project was built far to the north in the <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Badlands </LOCATION>, nobody thought of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> marshes. `` Each one of these dams is a sediment trap,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` They have reduced the sediment substantially. In a free-flowing system, there was up to 500 million tons a year.'' It took 700 years for <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> sediment to build the marshes of the current delta. It took 22 years, from 1956 to 1978, for half of those marshes, more than 1,000 square miles, to disappear. `` We took a very dynamic system and made it stable,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said, `` and there were some totally unforeseen consequences.'' Natural forces were at work, too. Spongy soil compresses under its own weight. Salt water levels are rising slowly. And hurricanes can wipe out miles of marshes in a day. `` You take one like <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> in 1965 and it just rolls the marsh up like a rug,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. Hurricanes pile up walls of water in front of them. Those tidal surges used to dissipate over miles of marshes. Now, they funnel through canals and navigation channels, spreading salt water miles inland, killing vegetation and carving up the wetlands. Environmentalists blame Big Oil and the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. `` It comes with the territory,'' <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said of the criticism. `` In a way, the buck does stop here. People can study it, talk about it, but eventually anything that is going to be done will be done by the state and the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> in some cooperative way.'' <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON>, chairman, chief executive officer and president of <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, says the oil industry has been unfairly targeted. <ORGANIZATION> LL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E, which owns more than 600,000 acres of marshland, the largest private holding of coastal wetlands in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, makes most of its money from oil and gas on its land, but also leases tracts for hunting and trapping. <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> estimated that hunting for petroleum in the marshes and dredging canals to reach oil and gas deposits caused about 10 percent of the loss. The remaining 90 percent has been due to natural forces exacerbated by the trapping of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in its current channel, <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> said. `` We do n't claim we are absolutely guiltless,'' <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> said, `` because when you build a canal through wetlands, you are going to chew up a certain amount of wetlands.''

 To <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marmande </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the dying oak is a symbol. `` It was a beautiful, full-grown tree when my great-grandfather first saw it 140 years ago. I remember when I was 7 or 8 years old, having picnics with my mama and the family here, and the branches spread way over there,'' <PERSON> Marmande </PERSON>, 31, said, sweeping his arm toward a point 30 feet away. `` Now, it's dying. Its roots are in salt water.'' The plight of the 200-year-old live oak mirrors what's happening to all marshland in coastal <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. Erosion and subsidence claim 30-50 square miles of wetland each year. `` Our way of life is going with it,'' <PERSON> Marmande </PERSON> said. `` There used to be 70 families making a living on this land. This was all farmland, sugar cane and potatoes, mostly, and cattle. ... `` This land used to support seven families just for trapping _ muskrat, otter, mink. Now there's just one. We used to catch worlds of crawfish here, but it's salt water now.'' The Marmande land is on a finger of high ground built by 700 years of spring floods on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The fresh water marshes that surrounded the peninsula were nourished by bayous and streams running from the river to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The river is trapped by levees now, and the bayous and streams no longer carry fresh water to the marshes. The 8-mile-long Marmande peninsula, about a half-mile wide at its landward base, ends at a 60-acre plateau that stands a dizzying 7 feet above sea level _ really high ground in these parts. `` You ca n't get there, except by boat,'' <PERSON> Marmande </PERSON> said. `` The road's under water in a couple of spots _ used to be 3 or 4 feet above sea level. `' Much of the damage has been done by the <ORGANIZATION> Houma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION>, a straight-shot channel dredged 30 years ago to provide quicker access to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Some of the salt water comes up through <LOCATION> Cades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> and Minors Canal. <PERSON> Marmande </PERSON> believes in levees and pumps to isolate the sources of salt water and hold back erosion. `` Look at what they've done in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. They've reclaimed land from the sea,'' he said. He points to a neighbor's land where a distinct line shows the intrusion of salt water _ a vigorous green stand of cypress on one side of the line, naked brown stumps on the other side. `` He built his own levee and put in his own pumps,'' <PERSON> Marmande </PERSON> said. `` But you ca n't get permits to do that anymore. We ca n't even get permits to raise a levee that's been there 14 years, and it's sinking. `` I consider it my obligation to try to do something about it. Maybe we can never put it back the way it was, but we can stop it from getting worse.''

 <PERSON> Addie </PERSON> <PERSON> Authement </PERSON> tied his square-bowed work boat to a piling 150 yards out from the shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boudreaux </LOCATION>. `` Me and my boy stuck this piling here on dry ground when he was about 15 years old. He's 34 now, and there's about 5 feet of water here. We trawl for shrimp all around that piling,'' Authement said. The piling is painted red. A red reflector is fixed to its top. It used to mark the entrance to a narrow channel that <PERSON> Authement </PERSON> and his brother dug to get their pirogues to the lake. `` It was just wide enough to push-pole our pirogues, a little-bitty canal. Not even a canal, a ditch,'' he said. It became a canal about 20 years ago when <LOCATION> Terrebonne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> widened it to about 10 feet, installed a pumping station and began using it to drain rain water flooding into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boudreaux </LOCATION>. The canal is 20-30 feet wide now and getting wider, its banks crumbling with every storm wind. Salt water from the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> killed groves of tall cypress trees and old oaks, leaving stark, dead stumps. Salt water also killed the marsh grass that fed muskrat and nutria. A dank salt water bay covers land that was a garden patch when <PERSON> Authement </PERSON>'s son was born. `` Who'd have told me 30 years ago that I'd be catching crabs there some day? I'd have told them they were lying,'' Authement said. `` The son of a gun stinks, too.'' Much of the land loss became inevitable 50 years ago when the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> completed flood control projects on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Levees trapped the river, robbing the marshes of fresh water and silt, and the spongy wetlands began contracting and sinking beneath the water. `` That used to be a big coteau _ real high ground,'' he said, pointing to an oak stump jutting out of the water, its trunk about 4 feet in diameter. `` I used to shoot squirrels there.'' Authement and his wife celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary in April. In the early years of their marriage, they shelled shrimp for 12 -LCB- cents an hour, shucked oysters for 50 cents a gallon, fished and sold sun-dried shrimp. `` It was hard, but it was a good life,'' he said. He blames the <ORGANIZATION> Houma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> for most of the problems. Dredged to provide straight-line access from <LOCATION> Houma </LOCATION> shipyards to oilfields in the Gulf, the canal also gives salt water access to the marshes. `` Forty years for all of this to go from fresh water to salt. I do n't believe we have 30 years left, unless somebody does something,'' Authement said.

 The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> built <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s wetlands, and only the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> can restore them <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> loses an acre of its productive wetlands every 15 minutes. At that rate, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, would be swallowed up in about 14 months. An estimated 10 percent to 20 percent of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s loss is due to exploration, drilling and production of oil and gas in the marshes and offshore. The main reason for the rest of the loss is that man, in taming the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> with dams and levees, cut off the supply of fresh water and silt that kept the wetlands green and growing. Any plans for rebuilding marshes involve getting <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> water back where it used to flow naturally, but that calls for big-ticket items. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> is committed to spending $ 130 million for just three freshwater diversion projects, one under construction at <LOCATION> Caernarvon </LOCATION>, about 15 miles downriver from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the others in final planning stages. This is an impoverished state with no money to spare: its teachers are among the nation's lowest paid, its police and fire departments are cut back to the bone, its roads are crumbling and its universities are underfunded. Unemployment is at 11.7 percent. The cheaper, less dramatic route would be to save what's left, if possible, or delay its loss. There are plenty of proposals, from planting trees to tearing down the levees. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is testing marsh grass and mangroves to find the toughest strains to help defeat wave action and tie down fragile soil. State and federal agencies are issuing fewer permits for wetlands activities. Some ideas seem too small to have any impact. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> spread discarded Christmas trees in shallow coastal waters. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> plants trees on marshland hummocks. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> sets out sprigs of marsh grass. Piles of old Christmas trees might trap sediment and slow erosion, restoring and protecting the marsh. Roots from new vegetation might also hold sediment. `` Usually, thinking big is the way to go, but we may have to think small on this problem,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, the first biologist to be named manager of a wetlands restoration project by the Corps. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Land and <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> thinks small in a big way _ 400 water-control weirs on the 600,000-plus acres it owns in the coastal marshes. The land, the largest private holding of coastal wetlands in the country, is dotted with LL & amp; E's oil wells. Starting in 1956, long before the plight of the wetlands was obvious, LL & amp; E began building weirs across inlets and bayous that ebb and flow with the tides. The low dams, their tops below water level, are designed to break the force of waves on their way in and slow their retreat until they have dropped their load of sediment. The weirs' effects have never been scientifically measured, but comparisons with unprotected marshes show they work, asserts <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighton </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON>, chief executive officer and president of <ORGANIZATION> LL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; E. `` If there are two little natural channels going back into the marsh, both about 30 feet wide, and you put a little weir on one and not on the other, we can see that after a time, one is still 30 feet wide, and the other has eroded on back into the marshes,'' <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> said. `` We have areas where we have the weirs in place, and another land owner, maybe a mile over, has never had them, and our guys can demonstrate that our land is in better shape than theirs is,'' he said. Dag Nummendal of <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s geology department believes such efforts are a losing fight, and the focus should be on cutting losses, rather than spending billions of dollars trying to win. He advocates a retreat from everything south of Highway 90, the old east-west route along a natural ridge from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, down through <LOCATION> Morgan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, then up to <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> and westward to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Geological Survey estimates Highway 90 will be an oceanfront road by 2083, if nothing is done to reverse coastal erosion. <PERSON> Nummendal </PERSON> recommends a rear-guard action of weirs, pumps and dams _ anything to slow the creeping sea _ while the residents of three dozen coastal communities head for higher ground over the next 50 years. `` That's ludicrous. That's too ridiculous even to consider,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marmande </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houma </LOCATION> businessman and farmer. To leave would mean abandoning land his French-born great-grandfather bought in 1840. `` I would be abandoning everything my father, my grandfather and my great-grandfather worked for, if I left.'' <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> and his fellow project manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, say rudimentary studies have looked at turning the river loose below <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. One proposal involved dredging a new navigation channel to connect with the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Outlet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, tearing down levees and taking ship traffic out of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` Essentially, -LRB- it would -RRB- abandon navigation in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> channel, let the channel silt up to whatever depth it wanted to _ about 17 feet _ and put a lock in the river,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> said. The Gulf Outlet Canal is an underused backdoor path from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, deemed an economic godsend when it was dredged through the marshes 30 years ago. A major source of flooding in Hurricane Betsy in 1965, it introduced salt water into previously fresh marshes in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, helping to accelerate the death of miles of cypress swamps. <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> on environmental matters, said letting the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> go wild below <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was not realistic. `` There are tremendous downsides to that,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. `` No. 1 is the cost. No. 2 is that you're going through a tremendous amount of wetlands doing that excavation of a new channel. `` Growing up in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> and seeing the tremendous loss and devastation from the Gulf Outlet, I do n't believe we ought to be looking at dredging another channel to solve environmental problems.'' <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> favors building big sluices to let controlled amounts of river water flow through the levees and dump replenishing sediment through the marshes. The freshwater diversion project at <LOCATION> Caernarvon </LOCATION>, when completed in two years, will dump 8,000 cubic feet of water into the marshes each second. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said he and the head of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Templet </PERSON>, believe freshwater and sediment diversion structures hold the answer to restoring the marshes. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Templet </PERSON> has said we may need as many as 20 of these structures, rather than the one being built and the two or three being contemplated,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. `` It will take that many to get the silt back in the marshes.''

At least 50 barrier islands off <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> have washed away over 30 years, exposing delicate marshes and wetlands to direct assault by the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` Barrier islands are like your skin, the first line of defense against infection,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wetlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a branch of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. However, he said, `` It would be enormously expensive to restore them.'' `` Something can be done, but it would be very, very expensive,'' echoed <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a project engineer with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. `` Not only would you have to restore them, but then you have to maintain them. `` We had a study just last year that looked at barrier island maintenance as a way to protect marsh behind the barrier islands and also as a means to reduce storm surge and hurricane damage inland. Even picking up those benefits, the cost was just prohibitive.'' Almost 2,700 miles of barrier islands protect the coasts of 18 states along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and all of the islands are threatened. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> has fewer barrier islands, but they are also eroding and drifting inland. Fire Island, a sliver of sand and expensive cottages just east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, is losing beaches on both the seaward and landward sides despite groins and jetties built to save them. A million cubic yards of sand shift along the coasts of both <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION> and Cape Cod each year. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has been protected by seawalls since a hurricane killed 6,000 people in 1900. But its beach eroded after the wall was built _ the sort of tradeoff made wherever man has moved onto the islands. Seawalls, jetties, groins and rocks all produce the same result: they direct wave action elsewhere, and the beaches wash away. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Valence </PERSON> is mayor of Grand Isle, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s only developed barrier island. A 2,000-foot section of its beach is under a state of emergency as Gulf waters lap at a motel's pilings and close in on state Highway 1, the only route onto the island. <LOCATION> Valence </LOCATION> wants to build protective rock jetties and estimates the project will cost about $ 422,000. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, parish engineer and civil defense director for nearby <LOCATION> Terrebonne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>, predicted the project would cost 10 times that much and would fail unless the rocks were given a sound foundation and provisions were made to get fresh sand to the beach. `` Unless it's done right, those rocks are just going to eat themselves into the sand and disappear,'' he said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has earned his air of authority. Five years ago, he defied conventional advice and saved the eastern tip of <LOCATION> Isle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derniere </LOCATION>, where pounding waves were threatening to cut off two-thirds of a mile. Isle Derniere, French for <LOCATION> Last </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, is the largest of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s barrier islands at 1,800 acres. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' repairs have withstood eight hurricanes, absorbing the force of tidal surges that otherwise would have hit coastal communities unchecked. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> used all natural materials. Near the area being washed over by waves, he found deposits of especially coarse sand. His crews scooped that sand into a protective dune that topped out at 8 feet above sea level, then filled the holes with the finer sand off the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> floor. Next he hired students to plant seagrass to anchor the sand. `` The key to keeping what you've got pumped up on the island is vegetation,'' he said. `` In the first year of its existence, it faced three hurricane surges, and it was completely overtopped by Hurricane Juan,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We had a number of hurricanes every year since then. `` Hurricane Gilbert -LRB- last fall, -RRB- even though it hit 500 miles away, sent a storm surge here that overtopped every levee in southern <LOCATION> Terrebonne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION>. ... The vegetation held up fine.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the best way to save the barrier islands would be to put $ 10 million in trust for 10 islands, then use the interest each year to restore one. `` At the end of 10 years, you'd go back and start over again,'' he said. `` You ca n't think of it as a one-shot civil engineering problem. That was my major problem to begin with,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` I'm used to putting something up in concrete and five years later having it look the same way. `` The first time I went out there after a hurricane, I was very disappointed. The geologists were ecstatic that it survived as well as it did.''

 <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowanko </PERSON> plays the latest in a long line of television heroes on the run in his role as the title character in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> Sunday movie `` The Gifted One.'' Kowanko plays <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, a man of special mystical powers, pursued by Dr. <PERSON> Boardman </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhys-Davies </PERSON> -RRB-, an opportunistic scientist who can hardly wait to experiment on <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> to see what makes him tick. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s mind uses the full potential that man's capable of,'' said <PERSON> Kowanko </PERSON>. `` He's gifted. He can direct the electrical power of his body like a laser to heal. He can place himself in synch with any living thing or lock into someone else's subconscious. `` That gift can also be painful. He has an acute sense of right and wrong. He does n't want to take advantage of it in a dark way. Nor does he want to be exploited by the military or anyone else.'' The `` chase'' story is a favorite television premise. The most popular was `` The Fugitive,'' which ran on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in 1963-67 and starred <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Janssen </PERSON> as a man wrongly accused of killing his wife and was pursued by law enforcement authorities while searching for her killer. In `` The Immortal,'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> during 1970-71, the lead character was a man immune to disease who was on the run because a ruthless billionaire wanted his special antibodies. The short-lived `` Hot Pursuit'' on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 focused on a young couple fleeing a false charge of murder, and a space alien and his son were chased by government scientists in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Starman'' in 1986-87. The form even inspired a CBS sitcom parody in 1966-67, `` Run Buddy Run,'' in which a hapless man was on the run from gangsters. In `` The Gifted One,'' as in `` The Fugitive,'' the hero is on a quest of his own while being pursued. He's looking for his real mother after learning he is not the son of the couple who raised him; he's running from the people who want to exploit his powers. `` The Gifted One'' is not as mystical as `` <PERSON> Kung </PERSON> <PERSON> Fu </PERSON>,'' about a Eurasian monk wandering the Old West while being pursued by agents of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> imperial family and American bounty hunters. But, like `` <LOCATION> Kung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fu </LOCATION>,'' `` The Gifted One'' features flashbacks to the hero's childhood. The movie was to have been the pilot for a possible series, but the show is not on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s fall schedule. `` I thought we'd get picked up for a series right away,'' <PERSON> Kowanko </PERSON> said. `` I still think we have a chance for a backup order. I think it's a good alternative. It's not a cop show. It's a fantasy. He has powers but he's not a super human being. He's not a space alien.'' <PERSON> Kowanko </PERSON>'s own background sounds like the concept for a series about a man on the move. He was born in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> but was raised in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> after his parents divorced. He returned to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> at 15 to mine sapphires with his stepfather. He worked in construction, was a deck hand on a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> towboat, waited tables and was a ski bum in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> when he was `` discovered'' and asked to audition for a commercial. `` I was an adventurous soul,'' he said. `` I worked on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> during my <PERSON> Huck </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> fantasy. I worked from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, to Ste. <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, all 27 locks and dams, pushing 15 barges. My job as deck hand was to take the barges apart because only half could go through the locks at a time.'' He went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1980 and was signed to a development deal by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Later, he was in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> series `` For Love and Honor.'' He played <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> in the movie `` Patty,'' about the kidnaping of <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In the last five years he has moved back and forth between here and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where he and his mother own a fruit farm and vineyard in the <LOCATION> Outback </LOCATION> along the Tropic of <LOCATION> Capricorn </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Tide Against Marijuana And Free Sex, But For Work And Angels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans are turning against marijuana and greater sexual freedom. Large majorities of them also favor stronger family ties, more emphasis on hard work and less on money. They especially trust organized religion, and two-thirds are members of a church or synagogue. But half think religion is losing influence on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> life, while a third think it's increasing. Most think a person can be a good Christian or Jew without attending religious services, but 42 percent do so each week. A third say they have experienced a powerful religious insight or awakening. And most teen-agers affirm belief in angels. These are among the varied facets of faith turned up in recent Gallup organization polls, and summarized by its <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in its monthly Emerging Trends. Most of the surveys were among a representative 1,200 or more, with a margin for error of less than 4 percent either way. One of the most unusual and consistent findings in this age of technocracy is that one of every three Americans say they have had a `` mystical experience, that is a momemt of sudden religious insight or awakening.'' The center says this `` is one of the least explored, yet one of the most fascinating aspects of the spiritual life of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, sometimes described as an other-worldy feeling or union with God or a universal spirit.'' The Gallup poll first began exploring the topic in 1962, finding that 20 percent then reported such experiences. By 1976, the proportion had risen to 31 percent, and has ranged above that since, 33 percent in 1988. `` Such an experience often appears to have a profound effect on the outlook and direction of a person's life,'' the report says, adding that the experiences are `` more often gradual than sudden. `` One of the most interesting aspects of these phenomena is that they happen to the non-churched and the non-religious as well as to persons ... who say religion plays an important role in their lives.'' On the drugs and sex issues, the trend is definitely down. During the past 10 years, public acceptance of marijuana has plunged _ from 20 percent in 1978 to 13 percent in 1981 to only 8 percent today. In the same period, overall public demand for greater sexual freedom fell from 29 percent in 1978 to 25 percent in 1981 to 22 percent today, with the sharpest downturn among young adults, although they still are more likely to espouse it. Support for stronger family ties, now 94 percent, has remained close to that throughout the decade. So has the support for less emphasis on money, now 67 percent, and for working hard, now 70 percent. Organized religion has for years been rated the most trusted institution, although the military momentarily surpassed it in 1986, and still ranks close to it. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is close behind, with television, organized labor and big business at the bottom of the list. The 65 percent reporting church or synagogue membership is the lowest ever recorded, down from 69 percent the year before. The record high was 76 percent in 1947. Attendance, now 42 percent, hit its high in 1955 at 49 percent. Seventy-six percent of Americans say one can be a good Christian or Jew and not attend religious services, a proportion that has changed little for the last three decades. Among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college students, about half of those who have heard of the `` New Age movement'' have an unfavorable view of it, and only 14 percent favorable. It is a modern, optimistic mix of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Western spiritual ideas. More teens than ever believe in angels, 74 percent of them, up from 64 percent in 1978. At the same time, 29 percent of them say they believe in witchcraft, up slightly from 25 percent in 1978. While a majority of teen-agers, more than 70 percent, approve of interfaith marriages, the proportion has dropped slightly since 1977. But approval of interracial marragies has jumped from 52 percent in 1977 to 65 percent now. Concerning church switchers, the biggest mobility seems to be among Methodists. Only a third raised as Methodists still identify with that church. A tenth raised as Roman Catholic no longer claim it. The findings indicated more stability among other denominations, with Baptists losing some and Presbyterians gaining some, and most other mainline denominations mostly holding their own.

<HEAD>The Biggest Bailout Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One day this summer, the government is going to create a giant corporation that will become the biggest business in history _ and the smart money men are watching closely. Too closely for comfort, according to some of the people involved in the savings and loan bailout. The new organization will be called the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, created to handle liquidation of fallen savings and loans and the sale of shaky ones under the bill now inching toward congressional approval. `` There are people out there waiting to pick the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s pocket before it has its pants on,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, D-S. They will be very deep pockets. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, D-Tex., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> will be responsible for handling more than $ 400 billion in real estate and other assets of insolvent savings and loans Under the bailout bill that is to be put into its final shape over the next month or so by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, it will have a high-profile board of overseers, including Secretary of the Treasury <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is to appoint a chief executive to run the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Asking three of the busiest individuals in government to oversee the disposition of hundreds of billions of dollars in real estate and other assets is foolish,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., who wanted a bigger and, in his view, stronger supervisory board `` The potential for scandal is tremendous.'' The bill provides that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will take over the insurance role of the bankrupt savings and loan insurance fund and will assume control of insolvent S & amp; Ls. The <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will be responsible for selling off assets to liquidate them, with proceeds to help pay for the bailout. <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, said liquidating and selling S & amp; Ls `` is going to be a very unpleasant task,'' costing jobs, money and guaranteeing lawsuits. `` There will be more opportunity for mischief than I would like to see,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. Neither version of the S & amp; L bill spells out roles very clearly; <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said he assumes his <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> will play a part in the liquidation operation. It has some experience in the field after selling off $ 9 billion in assets of failed commercial banks. <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said those sales led to 21,000 claims and lawsuits _ on transactions that will be dwarfed by <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> operations. The numbers point to the challenge of finding lawyers, accountants and appraisers who know the field and are not already tied up in S & amp; L cases. Hiring a boss will present the same problem _ <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> said it will have to be `` an individual of unquestioned integrity ... with extensive business experience who does not hold a position that would present a conflict of interest.'' While there is no real blueprint for the operation _ `` who does what is far from clear,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has set some guidelines. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill forbids real estate sales at bargain basement prices, to avoid undercutting markets that already are weak. But the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to dispose of assets as quickly as possible at the best price it can get. And holding property off the market would create uncertainty that could be just as bad for depressed real estate prices. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> added a requirement that low-income housing groups get first refusal on the sale of residential property. As the House-Senate conference on the savings and loan bill begins work, some members still are worried about the corporation they are creating. `` Many of us believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is the Achilles' heel of this bill,'' Rep. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> said. Congressional qualms are heightened by the industry talk about the bonanza ahead, `` potentially a diamond mine of opportunity'' according to Nation's Building News. `` The name of the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> game will be sales at discounts,'' that publication said in its June 5 edition, cited by <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` For savvy buyers, <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>'s regional and local offerings could provide years of tempting deals. And profits.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> advertised an even more specialized newsletter, Resolution Trust Reporter, to begin publication on Sept. 11, reporting on <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> operations it said will affect every real estate market, developer, appraiser and lender in the country. `` Who is going to cash in when the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> opens its doors?'' that publication asked. `` How about you?''

<HEAD>A Handle on Dependent-Care Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American employers in increasing numbers are offering workers a tax-saving arrangement called a `` dependent care reimbursement account.'' For two-income couples and single parents, this program serves much the same function as the traditional tax credit available to workers who have dependent-care expenses necessary for them to do their jobs. But the reimbursement account differs in several important ways from the tax credit. If you have a choice between the two -LRB- you ca n't pick both -RRB-, financial advisers say you might well come out ahead with the reimbursement account In a typical case, reimbursement accounts are offered to employees with children up to the age of 13, or with older stay-at-home dependents who need care. Employees who enroll in the plan figure their expected costs for each year, and then request that a proportionate sum be withheld from their regular paychecks. The money withheld is subtracted from their taxable income. After you pay your dependent-care expenses, you submit copies of your bills or canceled checks to your employer, who then reimburses you from the money in your account. If this strikes you as a bit unwieldy, you're by no means alone. You might be put off further by the warning that you need to figure your contributions to the account carefully. The rules state that any unused money in your account at yearend ca n't be reclaimed. It's gone. So why go to all the trouble? Why not just save up your canceled checks and take a dependent-care tax credit each year? Well, because it might save you some money, says the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Coopers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lybrand </ORGANIZATION>: `` For almost everyone, the reimbursement account will be the better choice.'' With such an account, people in the upper tax brackets can save 28 percent or 33 percent on each dependent-care dollar up to $ 5,000 a year, the firm points out. That compares with a 20 percent tax credit for upper-income workers on a maximum of $ 2,400 for one dependent or $ 4,800 for two or more. Furthermore, you do n't pay Social Security tax -LRB- at a rate of 7.51 percent -RRB- on the money that goes into your reimbursement account. The child-care credit has no effect on your Social Security tax. In lower income brackets, the child-care credit offers a savings of up to 30 percent. However, says <ORGANIZATION> Coopers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lybrand </ORGANIZATION>, `` most lower income people will find this is more than offset by the reduced Social Security and income taxes and, possibly, by a higher earned income credit.'' All in all, not bad: More options for many people in an era when tax breaks are disappearing fast. But there's a catch. It is very likely that fewer people _ much fewer, one might speculate _ will take advantage of any writeoffs for dependent care in 1989 than have done so in years past. Starting this year, whether you use a reimbursement plan or claim a dependent-care credit, you must specify the Social Security number or taxpayer identification number of the `` care provider.'' This gives the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> a means of checking whether all the money claimed as child-care expenses is reported as taxable income by the person or organization receiving the payments. It also defines more clearly cases where you are legally required to pay such things as Social Security tax and unemployment insurance for anyone who earns $ 50 or more working in your home in any calendar quarter. That pretty well puts all dependent-care tax breaks out of reach for anybody who does n't play the game strictly by the book.

<HEAD>After Three Months, Blot of Oil Still Spreads Across Alaska Coastline</HEAD>

 Three months have passed, and the sea still coughs up dead birds with every change of the tide. Three months have passed, and an army of workers 9,000 strong has yet to completely clean even one heavily oiled beach. Three months have passed, and the biggest oil spill in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history gets bigger every day, spreading its slime farther across <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s wild southern coast, pushing its poison deeper and higher along the food chain. `` We keep hoping for some kind of closure, some sign that this is all the damage we have and we can deal with it,'' says <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellina </PERSON>, superintendent of Kenai Fjords National Park. `` But we ca n't. The oil disappears one day when the waves clean a beach, only to wash up on another beach the next day.'' Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>'s bountiful waters and mountainous islands were the first to be fouled after the tanker Exxon Valdez rammed a reef March 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil. But the damage did n't stop there. Streamers of oil and tar balls leaked out between the sound's barrier islands and were pushed by Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> currents to beaches 450 miles away. Oil now has tainted more than 700 miles of shoreline, from the glacier-carved cliffs of Kenai Fjords to the clamoring bird rookeries of Katmai National Park, from lonely <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> beaches to the mouths of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> salmon streams. Cleanup workers have found the oil-soaked bodies of about 26,000 sea birds, 784 sea otters and 57 bald eagles. The spreading oil has other victims. Fishermen and other coastal residents who make their living from the ocean cringe each week at news of more beaches polluted and more fishing grounds closed. The wreck of the Exxon Valdez created an environmental catastrophe that unfolds in one little tragedy after another: _ A wildlife official filming damage on a beach sets a video cassette down on a black rock, and the rock crawls away It turns out to be an oil-smeared duck. _ A burly fisherman breaks into tears as he describes steering his boat through the slick: no water lapping, no birds crying, just the sickening silence of oil slipping past the hull _ At a bird rescue center in <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>, some of the patients are failing They have been washed clean, but not before swallowing fatal doses of oil. They do n't cry out; instinct tells them not to advertise their distress to predators. `` They just get real quiet, sit in a corner and die,'' says rescue coordinator <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>. Like a candy bar in the hands of a 2-year-old, crude oil from the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> has gotten onto everything. Rainbow sheens on the water stream from suffocating mats of black goop on beaches. Wind and waves whip oil into a sticky froth that workers call `` chocolate mousse.'' Tar balls bob in the surf, washing ashore to melt in the sun and sink into the sand. Oil splatters driftwood logs high above the tide line and sinks as much as 3 feet into gravel beaches. Undulating blobs of oil hang below the water's surface, ready to foul fishermen's nets. At first, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> boldly promised to clean it all up. `` We're going to pick up _ one way or the other _ all the oil that's out there,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> told reporters one week after the Exxon Valdez ran aground. The promise did n't keep for long. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was too slow and the spill was too big for booms to contain the oil immediately after the accident. And the company missed its chance during the first few days to burn off large quantities of oil or disperse it with chemicals. Some oil was skimmed up, but for the most part <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had to wait for oil to wash up on shore, where the goo could be scraped, wiped or flushed painstakingly from rocks and gravel. By May 1, the clean-it-all promise had been modified. Exxon proposed to clean 364 miles of coastline by mid-September, noting that it might have to leave 191 additional miles of lightly oiled shore to be washed by nature. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> approved <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, but even the limited cleanup may prove beyond the company's capability, despite an investment of more than $ 200 million to date. The cleanup effort now includes more than 9,000 workers, 800 boats, 45 oil skimmers, and 60 airplanes and helicopters. Hundreds of workers clad in rain slickers and hard hats crowd into coves that in most years might see a few fishermen or recreational boaters, if anyone at all. Barges nose up to shore, carrying generators and boilers to heat the water sprayed from hoses on the beach. Skimmers just offshore pick up oil as it flushes off the beach, while yet more vessels tend containment booms to keep the washed-off oil from spreading. Where there is n't enough machinery, workers hit the beaches with shovels, absorbent pads and plastic bags, scooping and scraping and wiping by hand. `` It has become pretty labor-intensive,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Plante </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which is overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup effort, has `` signed off'' on about 50 miles of shoreline along Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. But that does n't mean a beach is clean _ it just means <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> can move on. Even the most intensive scrubbing can not touch oil imbedded deep within a beach. The word `` clean'' is now taboo on official forms used to track <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts. Workers do n't clean beaches anymore. They `` treat'' them. The difference is more than semantics, as a visit to a Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> beach with a state environmental official shows. `` This,'' says <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Provant </PERSON> as he kicks an oily rock, `` is a treated beach.'' Provant, the on-scene cleanup coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, is standing on a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach known to officials as GR-1A. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> signed off on this beach May 29, declaring that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> crews had `` completed removal of gross contamination.'' Provant saw it back then, and it looked pretty good, he says. But now the oil is back. Globs of mousse litter the cobbled beach. Rainwater beads up on the rocks as it would on the waxed hood of a car. Provant digs into the sand, and his hand comes up greasy brown. `` If you dig, you find oil down quite a ways,'' Provant says. `` You can see how much oil has been washed back in or has percolated up from below. We're really not through with this beach.'' Provant's agency hounds <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, suggesting ways the cleanup could run more efficiently. Exxon, state and federal officials spend hours each day arguing over how deeply to clean particular beaches, or whether cleaning them will do more harm than good. `` Everybody wants a clean beach, us included,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Plante </PERSON> `` The definition of clean is subject to interpretation. What we're obviously going to do is work as hard to do the best job we can. We may have some disagreements over whether it's sufficiently clean.''

 While the arguments rage onshore, the death toll mounts at sea. Stymied by vast distances and stormy weather, bird rescuers have been able to capture, clean and release only about 500 sea birds. For every surviving bird, more than 50 dead ones lie in freezer vans _ more than 26,000 in all. And that's just a fraction of total mortality. Some biologists say that for every dead bird collected, perhaps 100 have died unnoticed. Sea otters appear to be the hardest-hit marine mammal. The 784 dead sea otters collected so far represent about one-tenth of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>'s total population. Harbor seals may be suffering, too, but few carcasses have been found. `` Dead seals sink like lead balloons,'' explains state marine biologist <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>. The oil's lethal reach extends down the food chain. On some beaches, mats of oil have wiped out all life, suffocating intertidal creatures such as limpets, mussels, crabs and starfish. And the oil reaches upward, to the tops of tall shoreside spruce trees where bald eagles roost. Oiled sea birds have become a fatal attraction for scavenging eagles, killing 57 of the birds of prey. Biologists have collected lifeless eggs from 30 abandoned eagle nests in the spill area. Hungry brown bears on the shores of Katmai National Park have feasted on oily bird carcasses until they could eat no more, digging holes in the sand to cache the leftovers. Bears are hardy creatures, but biologists have radio-collared 30 of them to study their reaction to swallowing so much oil. `` We have n't determined what effect it has on them. But I can imagine what it would do to me,'' says Katmai National Park Superintendent <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bane </PERSON>. At the very top of the food chain are the humans who live close to nature in coastal villages. When Aleut natives complained that the oil spill kept them from gathering food through fishing and seal-hunting, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> flew in cases of beef, chicken and diced ham. It gave the villagers stomachaches. Many commercial fishermen have been idled by the spill, though some have landed jobs with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, leasing their boats at rates of $ 3,400 a day and more. Most of the salmon and halibut swimming beneath the oil appear to be surviving. But fisheries worth more than $ 110 million have been canceled or postponed by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials worried that surface oil might taint fish as they are hauled from the water in fishermen's nets As spring turns to summer, even <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials are starting to waver on the question of finishing the cleanup by mid-September, a deadline long dismissed as unrealistic by some state and federal officials. `` It's always a hope,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Plante </PERSON>. `` But it's tougher to predict whether we'll do it by then. That's our plan. We've always said we will not leave it uncleaned, and if that means coming back, so be it. The sooner the better for all concerned _ particularly for 120 frisky sea otters now swimming restlessly in floating pens. They've beaten the odds, thanks to rescuers at an otter hospital in <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> The animals are clean, healthy and ready to return to the wild. But they must stay put, biologists say, because the wild is not ready for them.

 The rhetoric surrounding the nation's worst oil spill sometimes has grown as muddled as the North Slope crude fouling <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s southern coast Just how bad is the spill? How is the cleanup going? Here's a look at three months of changing pronouncements, promises and predictions offered by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and other officials. _ MARCH 24 The Exxon Valdez rams a reef, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil. _ MARCH 25 State environmental officials call the initial response by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` inadequate and unacceptable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnel </PERSON> says, `` I think our people did an excellent job.'' The slick covers 28 square miles. _ MARCH 30 `` We're going to pick up _ one way or the other _ all the oil that's out there,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> tells reporters in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. _ MARCH 31 The slick now covers 600 square miles. `` Absolutely not, it has not gotten away from us,'' <PERSON> Cornett </PERSON> says. `` We are making good progress on this cleanup.'' _ APRIL 18 Oil has killed at least 1,850 birds and 328 sea otters. The slick has spread over 3,000 square miles. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman L.G. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> says he's confident most beaches will be clean by mid-September. `` Now I'm not going to tell you that if you go up there a year from now you wo n't find some black places on some rocks, but we're going to make every effort to get it off,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> says _ MAY 2 In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials say they now plan to leave nearly 200 miles of oiled coastline to be cleaned by nature. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> says, `` I believe we in <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> have shown our commitment and our determination to deal responsibly with the spill and all its effects.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s sense of betrayal by <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> is leading to stronger regulation of the state's most profitable industry in the long wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. It was 12 years ago this week that oil began flowing through the 800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline. Since then, the state has used its oil wealth to build roads and schools, boost its economy and keep its taxes low. But in the 12 weeks since the spill fouled Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, Alaskans have expressed anger over the industry's broken promise that it could protect the environment from such a disaster. `` Now that we've seen the down side we're going to be much more cautious about our relationship with the industry,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a longtime industry supporter. `` The message I get from my constituents is the state's going to have to be more vigilant in its own regulation of the industry, and we ca n't depend on the industry or other government entities to do that for us,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. State legislators last month passed an initial package of bills aimed at preventing future spills and narrowly approved a measure to cut an oil-industry tax break. The change will cost the oil companies operating on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope an estimated $ 2 billion over the next 20 years. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, head of an Anchorage-based group that represents oil-support businesses, is one of the few industry officials who has spoken publicly against what they see as political overreaction. `` I guess I'm shocked, confused and extremely concerned about where the state's relationship with its biggest industry is and where it's heading,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said last week. `` This is the worst I've ever seen it. The tax changes and additional restrictions on the industry sent an anti-development message about <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to the Lower 48, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> asserted. `` I've never seen any state that's turned and tried to do damage to their industry like <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has tried to do now,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. `` Can you imagine <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> trying to do to the auto industry what we're trying to do to oil?'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said he has seen no signs that <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s pro-development image has been tarnished by its recent actions against Big Oil. `` They're not happy, but I think that we're playing under a different set of rules,'' he said. `` As the new rules are understood and stability again returns to the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> economy, I think they're going to work out `` There may be some short-range exploration and production losses, but in the long range the fact remains that the industry has to go where the oil is. The oil does n't go to them.'' Republican <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> voted to maintain the oil tax break, but he has helped lead the post-spill campaign for more regulation. He and other legislators acknowledge that industry, state and federal officials became complacent about the risks involved in transporting oil across <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` I think after a decade of no serious and major accidents, that we assumed that was the norm,'' the <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> lawmaker said. `` There was a tendency of urban-area legislators to accept at face value what the industry told us, because a lot of us felt what was good for the oil industry was good for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.'' Money helped lawmakers forget the state's watchdog role, said Sen. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Pourchot </PERSON>, an Anchorage Democrat. `` When everybody's making money and everybody's feeling good about the economy, it's natural to think of yourself in partnership with the industry. You're making money, they're making money _ it's sort of a ` we' kind of thing,'' <PERSON> Pourchot </PERSON> said Many recall 1981 as a watershed year for the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, a year in which oil and development concerns began to outweigh environmental concerns. The Republican-led <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> especially became dominated by industry defenders. The Legislature, like the state, was infused with new Alaskans, many of whom had benefitted financially from the oil boom and wanted to see it last, <PERSON> Pourchot </PERSON> said. `` The whole view of boom, boom, boom and growth sort of swept the state at that point,'' he said. In 1981 the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> restructured the way state oil taxes are calculated and passed the tax break that remained untouched until this year. Proponents of the changes said the cost to the state would be negligible. `` In fact, it was a billion-dollar-plus loss to the state'' after just five years, said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>, speaker of the Democratic-led House. Although <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has spent and saved billions of oil dollars, some argue that its primary failure in the past decade was not getting more money from its oil to secure the state's future when the pipeline runs dry. Sen. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerttula </PERSON>, a Democrat who has served in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> since 1960, said lawmakers lost sight of their role as stewards of the oil for future generations. `` The wrinkles were out of the bellies of Alaskans, they were sitting there watching TV and not paying attention to their public ownership responsibilities,'' he said. `` We were n't paying attention to the bottom line.'' Throughout the past decade, development-oriented legislators opposed increased funding for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. At times the agency was given additional responsibilities without additional funding. When Commissioner <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> took over the department two years ago, its employees were working a four-day week because of budget cuts. He estimated then that the agency was $ 10 million short of the budget it needed to meet the minimum requirements of state and federal laws. But <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> insists the cuts did not create the conditions that led to the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> spill and the slow cleanup. He blames <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the consortium of oil companies that runs the pipeline, for failing to follow their own policies and the state-approved spill-cleanup plan. Next year, when most legislators face re-election and a new governor will be elected, oil industry influence will be a major campaign issue, <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> says. But <PERSON> Kerttula </PERSON> doubts concern over <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>'s influence will last long in a state that gets 85 percent of its revenues from the oil industry. `` The industry always wins,'' he said. `` They've got very strong economic clout and they're very firmly in control.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Campabello </PERSON> once made $ 10 an hour as a clerk in a <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> oilfield camp. Now she is working for free, helping to rescue sea otters caught in the nation's biggest oil spill. Each day from 6 a.m. to noon, she cracks clams and slices fish to feed ailing otters. Each day, she feels a little better about herself and a little worse about Big Oil. `` I used to believe in the oil companies. It was my job, and I did n't want things to go badly for them,'' she says. `` I've changed a lot.'' So have many Alaskans in the last three months. The wreck of the Exxon Valdez unleashed a flood of emotion across the nation as people mourned a pristine environment's lost innocence and voiced anger at those who let it happen. For many Alaskans, the anger and grief were compounded by the sense of personal responsibility that comes from living in a state heavily dependent on oil money. `` The relationship of Alaskans and oil development has always been one of uncomfortable resignation,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gist </PERSON>, a community psychologist from <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, who helped <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials respond to the disaster. While some have likened the spill to a death in the family, <PERSON> Gist </PERSON> says it's more like a messy divorce. `` In the end, you're always telling yourself that you should have known better, that you should n't have trusted the other so much,'' he says. Exxon accepted the blame for the accident, but many Alaskans could n't help but internalize the guilt, Gist says. `` Intellectually, folks know better. But emotionally, lots of people feel it. They say, ` I must have sold out.''' A good way to heal such emotional wounds, Gist says, is to regain control by doing something _ anything _ to set things right. Many Alaskans are following that advice. Cleanup officials and environmental groups have been flooded with calls from Alaskans wanting to know what they can do to help. <PERSON> Otter </PERSON> and bird rescue centers have more volunteers than they can use. `` When the spill hit, I got really upset,'' says Campabello, 29, who is camping in a tent-trailer while volunteering at the Seward otter rescue center. `` I felt it was really important not to sit back and not do anything.'' Reaction to the spill has evolved since March 24. `` The anger has turned more to soul-searching, I think,'' says <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, a schoolteacher in the southeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Haines </LOCATION>. `` Exxon and -LRB- tanker Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> are easy to blame. But we are all to blame,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> says. `` The people who are outraged are the very same people who moved to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> because they loved the pristine environment, and then supported the oil industry. They love the world around them, but they brought their selfishness up with them.'' He admits he was among them, each year eagerly collecting his dividend check from the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Permanent Fund, a state savings account fueled by oil revenues. Last year, the fund distributed $ 826 to every Alaskan. `` My dividend check is blood money,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> says. `` I can not hold it in good conscience to accept that money anymore.'' He plans to send this year's check to an environmental group and is urging others to do the same. Gist says volunteering or getting politically active is valuable, even if it accomplishes nothing but peace of mind. The key is doing something that gives hope. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> tells of some school kids in Homer who seemed to know that without being told. As adults frantically built log booms to guard the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> town from drifting oil, the children were on the beach, scratching messages in the sand. They wrote things like `` Ocean, we love you,'' and `` We're sorry, Mr. Sea.'' They called them prayers to the ocean, and when one of the children returned later to the beach, she ran to the same spot. The tide, of course, had wiped the beach clean, but the little girl was not disappointed. `` Look!'' she said. `` The ocean got our prayers.''

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenimore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> would be alive today, at least in hearts and minds, if <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> had n't hammered a stake through the heart of Natty Bumppo. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s demise as the quintessential author of the American frontier stems from a quirky essay written 44 years after his death, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s `` Literary Offenses of <PERSON> Fenimore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'' put Deerslayer, Leatherstocking and Natty's other incarnations out to pasture somewhere on the prairie of forgotten adventure tales. <PERSON> Natty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumppo </PERSON> was the frontiersman who appeared in <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s stories found in the `` The Leatherstocking Tales,'' including `` The Last of the Mohicans,'' `` The Pathfinder,'' `` The Deerslayer'' and others. `` Mark really did him in,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is celebrating the 200th anniversary of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s birth. This summer, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> hopes to shepherd 150,000 visitors to <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fenimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the Farmer's Museum, both devoted to pioneer life. Even so, that turnout will be just half the average summer gate for the other game in town, the Baseball Hall of Fame, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> wants <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION> pilgrims to know that <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> put the town on the map a decade before reputed baseball inventor <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON> created the sport in <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION>. Unlike <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, who remains popular, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> has been `` relegated to the status of having written adventure books for kids and shoved on the shelves of schoolchildren who would be just as happy to shove him back,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> aficionado <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDougall </PERSON>. Even without <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, the wordiness and sermonizing of `` The Last of the Mohicans'' and `` The Deerslayer'' probably would have eroded <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s popularity. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> had no editor, so his books were printed the way he wrote them. He considered revising a chore. <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s scorecard credits <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> with 114 literary offenses in just two-thirds of a page. Readers could n't tell <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s living characters from his corpses, and neither showed `` sufficient excuse for being there,'' <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s characters also made the most of dialogue, wrote <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, complaining that a <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> character's mouth `` was a rolling-mill, and busied itself all day long in turning 4-foot pigs of thought into 30-foot bars of conversational railroad iron.'' `` <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> characterizations may leave something to be desired,'' his great-great-grandson <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> S.F </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` But he did create one well-rounded and extraordinary character with Deerslayer. He has the same strength and immortality as <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>.'' Early <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most popular writer, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was the first to break the snob barrier and gain acclaim in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> his characters came to represent the typical American of the last century,'' said <PERSON> MacDougall </PERSON>, who has written a guidebook _ `` <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Otsego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'' _ to local sites important to the author's works. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> drew on the <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION> wilderness for many of his settings. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was the first novelist of the American frontier, the first to write sea novels and the first American author to earn his living solely as a man of letters. His vivid descriptions of landscapes inspired the artworks of his friends, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, and other <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> school painters. Nineteenth century travel books lifted entire <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> passages to describe the American frontier. `` His place in American literature is unassailable,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who writes on space issues for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION>. `` He really put the American novel on the map. He created the tradition of the lonely hero, which transcends the Western novel. You can find it in the novels of <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreiser </PERSON> and others.'' Europeans remain fascinated by <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s writing. A German film crew shot a documentary about <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> last year, and many Europeans visit <ORGANIZATION> Fenimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> each year, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` The harder -LRB- critics -RRB- knock him, the more he stands, like one of those clown balloons with a weight in the bottom that keeps popping back,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. Born Sept. 15, 1789 in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was an infant when his father moved the family to <LOCATION> Otsego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, called <LOCATION> Glimmerglass </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s novels. A land speculator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> had picked up 100,000 acres there in a bankruptcy sale, founding the village that bears his name. Before he started writing in 1819, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> was kicked out of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> because of his pranks, went to sea as a common sailor and served in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. His sailing years were grist for such forgotten sea novels as `` The Pilot'' and `` The Red Rover,'' works that influenced <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Melville </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>. Besides the five Leatherstocking novels, works of social criticism were among <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s 50 books, including a novel about totalitarianism predating <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>'s `` 1984'' by more than a century. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which is publishing <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> works that have been out of print for decades, thinks the new <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> editions will take the bite out of <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s essay. `` His earlier manuscripts and books were so corrupt, full of typos and errors, that people sometimes did n't know what he was writing about,'' <PERSON> Eastman </PERSON> said. `` All those funny things <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> wrote about were caused by typos. Those things are no longer relevant with these new editions.'' `` We're going back to his original manuscripts and correcting the errors,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who is working on the new editions. `` Each time they were reprinted they made new errors.'' Bypassed by railroads and canals, <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION> retains many of its 19th century landmarks. Businesses along the village's narrow streets also help remind visitors of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s legacy _ <LOCATION> Glimmerglass </LOCATION> Restaurant, <PERSON> Mohican </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>, Leatherstocking Travel. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> lived most of his life in <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION> and is buried in his family's private cemetery there, 100 miles northeast of <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s grave in <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> died in 1851. <LOCATION> Otsego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> has largely escaped the 20th century, as well. With no large industries and much of the lakeshore acreage owned by large landowners, the lake remains pristine compared to those in the Adirondacks to the north. Credited as the first conservation writer, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> urged preservation of natural resources in many of his books. `` Would <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> be pleased at the condition of his lake? Compared with other lakes today, yes. Compared with the lake he remembers, probably no,'' said biologist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harman </PERSON> heads <ORGANIZATION> Oneonta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s Biological Field Station on <LOCATION> Otsego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> became irascible and wrote little in his last years, instead suing critics for libel and neighbors for trespassing. It would have been time better spent writing, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> never endeared himself to his public in the way that turned <PERSON> Alcott </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thoreau </PERSON> into tourism industries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, he said. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has not treated its literary lights well, not as well as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` Had <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> been less of a curmudgeon and more in tune with public relations, his fate would have been better today.''

<TEXT>
 She held her own against a bombastic education secretary and turned her huge union into a force for school improvement, challenges almost equal to her growing up poor and black in the segregated South. Now the 2-million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> must choose a successor to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, the voice of the teachers union for six years and, some say, the best spokesman it ever had. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> should light a candle to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The organization owes her a great deal,'' says <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, president of the Princeton-based <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> is credited with shifting the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s focus from self-protection to a more professional concern for better education. Under her leadership, union delegates approved a Carnegie plan for a national board to set standards and certify teachers. The union started spending its own money on curriculum innovations and a foundation for education improvement that makes grants for dropout and illiteracy prevention programs. It also cooperated with administrators and principals on a joint guide to teacher evaluation. NEA is still a union, committed to collective bargaining and opposed in principle to merit pay plans supported by many outside the teaching field. But its recent activities have gone a long way toward eroding the obstructionist image that made it such an easy target in the early 1980s. Some conservative educators believe <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> has made only marginal progress. `` Her organization under her leadership has moved from the Middle Ages to the mid-18th century, and that's quite a lot to accomplish in six years. On the other hand, that still leaves them in the mid-18th century,'' says <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, who was an assistant education secretary in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, while admitting she would have liked to move faster on some issues such as child care and school restructuring, defends the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s pace. `` We would be the first to admit that our efforts are just the beginning,'' she said. `` What's important is that we're taking the steps We've said we know we must change and let's try it incrementally at first.'' Nevertheless, when she presides over her final convention next weekend, <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> says she will tell the 8,000-odd delegates that `` you have to do more. You have to be bold and you have to take more risks. What we've done is good, but it's not enough.'' The far-flung union has had a reputation, not entirely undeserved, for cumbersome bureaucracy and resistance to change. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and former Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> hammered at those flaws in repeated attacks on <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>, using it as a symbol of all that was wrong with American education. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> denounced the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> as intransigent and said its repeated calls for more education spending revealed `` a cash-register mentality.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> gave as good as she got, pointing out that demands for higher <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending never inspired that type of rhetoric from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. But out in the field, she found teachers in despair. `` The depression was so heavy,'' she recalled in an interview. `` You'd go in and it was like you were there as a missionary to try to boost the morale of the school, month after month after month.'' The years under administration fire turned out to have some positive effects. There was a backlash of sympathy for teachers and a new unity within the NEA. There was also a key decision by <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> about three years ago to take the offense, to move ahead with an <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> agenda rather than keep responding to attacks. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> says now that had she known what her first three years would be like, she would not have wanted the job. But, relying on the survival skills she learned as a child, she proved a match for both <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` When you live with adversity ... you force yourself to stand up,'' she said. `` You force yourself to persevere. You force yourself to see positive things.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> was raised in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, by a mother who had dreamed of becoming a nurse but was forced by the deaths of her parents and later her husband to work as a maid and short-order cook. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> was not yet 5 when her father died. Her mother supported two daughters and two foster daughters on $ 15 a week, sometimes working 18 hours a day, but always found time to attend PTA meetings. She brought home books her employers had discarded, held weekly spelling bees at home and punished <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> when her grades were not satisfactory. As a little girl, <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> wrote in an autobiographical essay, her clothes sometimes had more holes than fabric and she once had to go to school without shoes. At 8 she started helping her mother dust church pews and office desks. By 12 she worked full-time during the summer. When she graduated from her segregated high school, her teachers raised scholarship money through local churches to enable her to go to college. She honored them by becoming a teacher herself, a business teacher in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Moving from state chapter president to national secretary-treasurer to <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> president, <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> emerged as a charismatic leader so respected by her members that a room will be set aside for tributes to her at the NEA convention next weekend Her achievements win praise even from <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, her counterpart at the rival <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. He took her to lunch this month for the first time in six years, `` to tell her what a great job I think she's done,'' according to <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>. `` The people before her were not willing to take the risks or do the hard work. When she did, she got results.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> says she'll stay active in international education when she steps down from her NEA post this summer. She also wants to spend more time with her family and may pursue a graduate degree. The men vying for her title are <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON>, currently vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a member of the executive committee. The outcome is expected to hinge on last-minute campaigning at the convention. There are those who think it is impossible for <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> to be at once an aggressive union and a respected professional association. But <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> says she has spent six years balancing those roles, `` forging a marriage that will last for a very long time without sacrificing the integrity of either.'' Chances are excellent that whether <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> or <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> is elected, her legacy will endure. It's all been part of her plan, one of the reasons she moved more slowly than she would have liked, taking the time to educate and persuade and convert her members to each new idea. `` I wanted to make sure that when I walk away on Aug. 31, that change is in place, that the changes we've made will have roots,'' says <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>. `` If you agitate people and encourage them to be part of it, then they have ownership. And they will implement those changes when you're long gone.''

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> became president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, she often found herself overshadowed by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, the longtime president of the rival <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would make a statement and it was like you made a statement. Half an hour later, <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> would come back and say the same thing and people acted like he was a guru,'' she said. `` He is the AFT. It is like a cult.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> says she learned not to compete with <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, a philosopher and provocateur with a knack for grabbing headlines, and instead to talk and react from a teacher's perspective. `` Now a lot of those people have come to respect and appreciate me,'' she said. The AFT, which claims about 700,000 members to the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s 2 million, embraced the education reform movement from the start, while the lumbering <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> edged onto the bandwagon late and largely due to prodding by <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>. The two union leaders `` had some really bad clashes at the beginning,'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, the AFT president since 1974, now calls them `` the usual clashes of two rival organizations trying to pick up members.'' Now, <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> says, `` we get along fine.'' Both insist the other has changed. `` He has promoted himself to the position of statesperson so he ca n't fight like he used to. It would not be becoming to him,'' says <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>'s heavy involvement with the business community and the political establishment. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> contends that <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> started off with the typical NEA view of reform _ `` Why are these people criticizing the schools? Make them go away. Everything is pretty good.'' Unlike many, he said, <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> eventually became convinced that improvements were needed. `` She underwent a change, a growth,'' <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON> said. `` She's a different person today ... than she was three years ago. She's been the best spokesperson for the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> that I've ever known.''

 The three education secretaries of the last nine years would get grades ranging from A-minus to D from <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, the outgoing president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> gives her lowest mark of D to former secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who made repeated assaults on her organization during her six-year tenure. `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> did n't know how to get people to work with him,'' she said in an interview. `` He reminds me of the person who desperately wants people to work with them and like them but does n't know how to do it. He knew how to give the speech but he did n't know how to get the people to follow him.'' <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> reserves her highest mark of A-minus for <PERSON> Terrel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first education secretary. `` Bell was the leader, the one who had the vision, the substance. He understood education,'' she said. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> instituted the annual `` wall chart,'' a state-by-state comparison of education indicators, and commissioned the `` Nation at Risk'' report that fueled the education reform movement. `` He saved the department,'' she said, alluding to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign pledges to abolish it. The current secretary, <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, receives a C-plus or B-minus from <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>. `` He's not being allowed to do well,'' she said. `` Like <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> understands the issues. But he does not have the kind of support he needs to do the job. He's being hamstrung right now.''

The liberalization of the Reagan-era Caribbean Basin Initiative also would establish a guaranteed minimum floor for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of sugar from the region at present quota levels. Some committee members expressed concern Tuesday that the bill could work to the disadvantage of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and other sugar-exporting nations.

<HEAD>Tensions In International Trade Increasing, Says Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tensions have increased in international trade and the commitment of governments to free trade talks is facing its `` sternest test,'' says the organization sponsoring the talks. The 1988 U.S. Trade Act could have the greatest short-term adverse impact on the world trading system, the secretariat of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in a six-month review. The so-called Section 301 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law could lead to moves aimed at pressuring countries into bilateral trade accords outside <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>'s international trade rules, the review said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month singled out <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for priority action under the law that calls for penalties against countries deemed to be especially protectionist. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will raise the issue at the two-day council meeting beginning Wednesday, which is part of the latest four-year <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks known as the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round, a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> source said on condition of anonymity. The review said although much progress had been made in the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION>, there had been `` a further increase in the uncertainties and tensions affecting trade policies'' in the period reviewed, the six months until last February.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> exported a record 23.5 million cartons of grapefruit this year, up 14 percent from the 1987-88 season, citrus officials said. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwell </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the sharp rise to favorable currency exchange rates and increased spending on foreign promotions by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>ABC Radio to Run Abortion Special Despite Lack Of Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> officials say a special program on abortion hosted by <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> will run today even though national advertisers refused to buy time on the program. The 54-minute special airs starting at 2:06 p.m. EDT on about 144 radio stations across the country, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Severine </PERSON>, senior vice president of sales for the network, said Tuesday that he was able to find only one buyer _ <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' television show, which also features Ms. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> _ for one minute of the six minutes that were allocated for national ads He said advertisers `` are scared to death of the abortion topic. ... They just do n't want to be involved with any controversy.'' But <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, senior vice president at the radio network, said the program was so important to the network's objectives of providing timely programs on compelling topics that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was prepared to absorb all of the costs of producing the show. The costs can run to $ 12,000, he said. It is the latest example of advertisers backing way from programs that have either offended or risk offending individuals or groups who have become increasingly vocal in complaining about controversial subjects on radio and TV. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television network, for instance, had to cut prices to find buyers for ad time on the made-for-TV movie `` Roe Vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' which ran last month and dealt with the case that led to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 decision that legalized abortion. Advertisers have backed out of shows such as <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live'' and the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> television network's `` Married ... with Children'' after individuals or groups complained that they were offended by sexual references or profanity in the shows. The <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television network canceled two reality-based shows earlier this year because no advertisers signed up. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, executive producer of today's radio special on abortion, said no one has called for a boycott because of the topic. `` This is different. This is the news. It will be a straightforward, fair and balanced discussion of the issues,'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said. The show will feature Ms. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> as moderator of a panel that will include two people from each side of the abortion question. Listeners can call in with comments. <PERSON> Severine </PERSON> would not identify any of the national sponsors refusing to buy time. He said the unfilled national ad time will be used for public service announcements such as anti-drug or anti-crime messages. The time was being offered at a rate of $ 6,000 per minute, he said. No effort was made to reduce the price to attract sponsors. `` It was never really the money,'' <PERSON> Severine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON> said stations in 21 of the nation's 25 biggest radio markets have agreed to carry the special, which should attract an audience of 1.1 million adults. He said there were some local stations that were reluctant about carrying the program because of the topic and others did n't like giving up midday programming time, although they get to sell eight minutes of local ad time in the show. One of the stations planning to carry it is KOA in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, whose manager of operations, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, applauded <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts and said his station plans its own two-hour discussion on the issue moderated by a prominent psychologist immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> special. He said <ORGANIZATION> KOA </ORGANIZATION> expects to fill its ad time on the special with previously-purchased advertising commitments. The show is the first in what <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> says will be a series of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agenda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specials </ORGANIZATION> hosted by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s top TV news figures, including <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and newsman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON>. `` I'm certain that as we continue this series that it will get wider acceptance,'' <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON> said. The next program is tentatively set for August and will deal with juvenile crime.

<HEAD>LIN's Board Rejects McCaw's Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it was disappointed that the <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> board rejected as inadequate its $ 5.85 billion takeover bid, but said it is willing to discuss the offer. `` We remain confident that our $ 120-per-share price is full and fair,'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s vice chairman, said in a letter Tuesday to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pels </PERSON>, chairman and president of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The deal would be the biggest to date in the emerging cellular telephone business and would extend <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s reach as the industry leader. Cellular franchises have become increasingly lucrative as improvements in technology have boosted customer demand for mobile phones. LIN, which has interests in cellular telephones, television and publishing, said in disclosing its board's decision Tuesday that it was exploring alternatives including staying independent, recapitalizing or selling itself to other potential buyers. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, noting LIN's apparent willingness to talk to potential suitors, said he hoped LIN would make available to <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> any non-public information that it shares with others. `` As we have previously stated, we are genuinely ready and willing to meet with you to discuss our offer,'' he wrote. In national over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 2.62 -LCB- a share to $ 125.62 -LCB- on Tuesday while <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> rose 75 cents a share to $ 41.50. Analysts said they suspected <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, Wash.-based McCaw would eventually sweeten its bid. `` <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> wants LIN badly and will make counteroffers,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, a telecommunications analyst for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Among those rumored to be interested in LIN have been the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies, although some analysts have said it is unlikely any one of them could afford the earnings dilution that would result from buying LIN. `` For any one <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company to buy all of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> would be considerable dilution and these companies have promised 6 percent to 7 percent to 8 percent earnings growth,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, telecomunications analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. A bid for LIN could drag down earnings for years as the debt associated with making the acquisition would have to be repaid, he said. If a <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company were to get involved with LIN, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said, it was more likely that the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company would buy a partial stake in LIN. LIN said its board decided unanimously that the unsolicited offer from <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> was inadequate and not in the best interests of the company or its stockholders. In an effort to increase share value, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> said, the company intends to pursue its previously announced plan to spin off its seven TV broadcasting stations into a new subsidiary. It also said it was studying steps to make sure its shareholders would realize the extra value that would be created if LIN prevails in its legal fight with <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> over the right to buy <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION>'s interests in cellular systems in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> said some industry analysts have estimated a victory for LIN in that case would boost its stock value by $ 40 a share. LIN also said in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that it had contacted potential buyers and had met with them. It did not identify any of the potential buyers but said they included some that have `` initiated preliminary contacts in the past.'' Bear <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>' <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> said LIN and its financial advisers had done `` a brilliant job of getting investors excited and confusing them on what they are offering'' in the latest filings. `` There is very slim chance that anyone would top <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>,'' he said. Analysts have valued <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s bid at as much as $ 290 per potential cellular phone customer, or twice the $ 145 per potential customer price that <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay earlier this year for a 20 percent stake in McCaw. <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> announced separately Tuesday that they had concluded the deal under which a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary paid $ 1.37 billion for the stake in <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION>. LIN's interests include cellular systems serving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Its seven TV stations are network-affiliates and it owns a specialty publishing house that provides hardcover tourist guides often available in hotel rooms. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> has major cellular franchises serving customers in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore.

<HEAD>Checchi Says Questions About Debt In NWA Deal Are `Laughable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, who expects to meet this week with <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> about his proposed $ 4 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, says fears about debt in the deal are `` almost laughable.'' `` The amount of debt in this proposal is not the least bit excessive,'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The hardest part of my day was turning down all the banks that want to be part of this credit.'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s investment group, <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, signed a deal Monday to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 121 a share in cash. The financing includes $ 700 million in equity and $ 3.35 billion borrowed from a syndicate of commercial banks. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> wrote a letter May 15 to <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> saying the department was concerned about any acquisition that would have a `` substantial adverse impact'' on the company's financial structure. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said he expects to meet with <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> today or Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> To complete a transaction by the Sept. 18 deadline imposed by <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> needs a license from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which will examine the financial package to determine whether the group is financially fit to safely operate the nation's fourth-largest airline. Similar reviews have ranged in length from two months for an extensive fitness check last year of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> airlines to a six-month examination of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> that ended earlier this year, a department spokesman said. `` People who are sophisticated in the area of corporate finance, they're going to find that it's almost laughable that people are bringing this up as a concern,'' <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said, `` but certainly it's understandable. But concern about debt in the <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> deal prompted <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to annouce Tuesday that the buyout would likely result in a lower rating on <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s senior debt. The acquisition would raise total debt at <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to $ 3.7 billion from $ 945 million, second only to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> among airlines, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's said. The added annual interest expense of about $ 300 million would consume most pre-tax earnings and almost cut operating cash flow in half, the credit-rating agency said. It also said <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` weakened financial strength'' would make the carrier's plans for fleet modernization more expensive under the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's has not seen the details of his group's deal. What's more important, he said, is that bankers are lining up to get a piece of it. Despite skepticism, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union District Lodge 143, emerged Tuesday from a meeting with <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> confident that the airline could carry through its plan to double in size in the next five years. `` I think it's probable at this point that we can establish that,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, who heads a 20,000-member union, the airline's largest Not as confident were leaders of the 5,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> pilots union, who also met with <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> on Tuesday. `` Basically he said he feels that debt is his expertise and he only talked about it in general terms,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> unit. `` He said all the things you'd expect him to say. He told us not to worry.'' The pilots, who have an open contract and have threatened to strike if they do n't receive competitive wages and job security, have said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s deal would add debt that would be troublesome in an economic downturn and possibly lead to layoffs. But <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said his group's financing package is strong enough to carry the company through a recession as severe as the 1980-81 downturn. `` I would not enter any kind of transaction where the downside was not provided for,'' he said. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> promised to provide pilots with details of his financing package later in the week, <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> made a friendly gesture by saying he would consider giving <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> employees a stake in the company. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, 41, said the concept proved popular at other companies where he has worked, including <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But he said he wo n't discuss the measure until the pilots settle on a contract because it may be viewed as an attempt at gaining employee concessions <PERSON> Cheechi </PERSON> said he hopes to close the deal within about four weeks after the $ 121-a-share tender offer is launched Friday.

<HEAD>Lorenzo Greets New Pilots, Says He's Confident About Rebuilding Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> spoke with confidence about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' future as he personally assured new pilots of a deep commitment to see the carrier succeed, despite a crippling 3-month-old strike `` Every day that goes by, you see more and more realization of what we're doing,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday following graduation ceremonies for a group of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> recruits. `` An airline can be rebuilt, particularly an airline like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, because of the tremendous strengths and the tremendous assets that the company has. I've been very encouraged by what I've seen. While Eastern, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, is selling assets to reduce its debt, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the carrier is moving ahead with rebuilding and has begun discussions with aircraft manufacturers on buying new aircraft for the 1990s. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said he thought the federal bankruptcy court overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization will approve the airline's plan to rebuild at two-thirds its prestrike size. He called the plan `` very, very reasonable ... a much more practical solution'' than the unions' call for a new owner or the leanings of some creditors toward complete liquidation. `` You do have creditors who are frustrated and they'd like to get their money,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. `` We intend to make sure the company honors its contracts and provides the creditors what they're due.'' He called the union-backed buyout effort by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> `` a joke'' and said there were no legitimate buyers for Eastern as a whole. Eastern has `` been overwhelmed by the interest in most of these assets'' it's offering for sale, but he declined to discuss pending transactions. Earlier, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> and other executives were all smiles as they handed out diplomas and congratulations to 18 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot recruits who completed training. `` We are very, very committed to the success of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told them. Company spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has graduated 108 new pilots since it began seeking recruits about a month after the strike began March 4. He said there were 259 pilots who crossed the picket lines, not including 17 more veteran pilots who have told the company in the past week that they wish to return to work. There are 527 recruits in training, he said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said Eastern is well on track toward having enough pilots to carry out the airline's planned schedule expansion this summer. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> disputed that claim. `` We're not contradicting the statement in itself,'' said the spokesman, who asked not to be identified. `` But by numbers and by their own information, they are going to be able to fly the first days of the schedule, but they're not going to be able to continue to fly it'' due to lack of pilots. Eastern also announced Tuesday it will lease an A-300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> jet to <ORGANIZATION> VIASA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 1.4 million over four months. `` It's consistent with our announced business plan to make $ 1.8 billion in assets transactions and use more than $ 900 million to pay down debt,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Eastern is about $ 2.5 billion in debt. Earlier this month, its Northeastern Shuttle service was handed over to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days after its pilots and flight attendants unions joined a <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike that crippled the airline. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> must approve any asset sales. He approved the shuttle deal and the $ 277.5 million sale last week of 15 planes and six aircraft engines to a company that buys and resells airplane equipment. Eastern last week announced a deal to sell eight <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport gates, 16 jets and other assets to <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for $ 206.5 million. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> must approve that transaction, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions say they will challenge it.

Traders said the dollar's strength followed its higher trend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight. <PERSON> Yutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> trader, said the currency stayed just below 145 yen most of the day. `` Selling for profit-taking also helped to halt the dollar's further rise,'' he said `` Toward the end of the day, the dollar moved slightly up against the yen as it rose against the major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies,'' <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> added. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> sold an estimated $ 200 million in efforts to curb the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's rise, but it did not have much impact on trading, <PERSON> Nakamura </PERSON> said. The central bank does not comment on its foreign exchange market activities. Trading was inactive mainly because of uncertainties, he added. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 220.29 points the previous day, added another 111.81 points, or 0.34 percent, closing at 33,345.28. After early losses, the index reversed the trend and rose in the afternoon. <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the index began to climb when institutional investors bought `` a substantial amount'' of cheaper issues. In addition, he said, foreign investors were buying in arbitrage deals between the spot and futures markets. The dollar's rebound had no negative impact on Wednesday's stock trading, but trading was thin, <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> said. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 600 million shares, down from Tuesday's 700 million. `` Investors would not panic over dollar-yen fluctuations between 143 and 146 yen. But they are little motivated in buying at the moment since last week's wild fluctuations,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> added. Last week, the dollar closed at 151.30 yen on Thursday, its highest level in almost two years. It then lost 6.25 yen on Friday. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> lost more than 1,100 points during the week. Among today's gainers were steel and shipbuilding issues.

<HEAD>Some Rural Areas Left Out of Redevelopment Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of most economically depressed rural areas of the country may be left out of a key part of legislation promoted by the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, say officials of local development commissions. The bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., would provide $ 300 million to start a revolvng loan fund, but requires local matching funds for communities to receive any of the money `` It's OK to an extent, but when you get into the hardest hit rural areas, the reason there's no economic development there in the first place is because they ca n't afford it,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Alford </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama-Tombigbee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said he is disappointed the bill does not link the local match requirement to each community's ability to pay <PERSON> Alford </PERSON> said his agency ca n't use existing federal economic development revolving loan funds because most of the communities the agency serves do n't have the resources for the local match. The only exception to the matching fund requirement would be for communities with per capita income that is less than 70 percent of the national average. Then, only a 50 percent local match would be required. <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Braaten </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counties </ORGANIZATION> said her group is happy the bill requires applicants for revolving loans to notify county governments and work with state, regional and local governments in investment strategies. But she said her organization is disappointed that there is little funding for infrastructure. `` This is clearly the No. 1 need in rural counties,'' she said, adding that her group hopes more money will be forthcoming to rebuild rural roads and bridges. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Braaten </PERSON> were among dozens of local economic development officials from across the country at a news conference arranged by <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> to tout the bill he calls `` landmark legislation.'' Other key provisions of the bill would set up satellite educational and health communication systems and provide funds for improving drinking water. Despite their complaints about the local match requirements, both <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s legislation would provide a needed shot in the arm to rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They said they hope to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> that will work out final details of the bill to ease the local match requirements for distressed rural areas. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said he expects the measure to be approved by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> next month and would like to see it used as a model for the House. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., whose <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural development is working on its own bill, said he had seen a version of the Leahy measure `` There are some good points about that legislation, and I think it is fine as far as it goes,'' English said. `` I do n't think legislation drawn up by any one house is going to be the best approach to all the problems in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' English's subcommittee is half through a lengthy series of hearings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and will hold more in August in five regions of the country. He said legislation will be crafted after all the witnesses have spoken, probably early fall. He said a bill could be passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by December but his goal is sometime this session, which does n't end until December 1990.

 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> dissident group lost a third, key battle at the union's constitutional convention, but despite the outcome, the group's leader says he is happy with the way it went. About 2,000 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s constitutional convention turned back an attempt Tuesday by the New Directions movement to limit Japanese-style labor-management programs on factory floors. The decision came on two show-of-hands votes in which no more than 20 percent of the delegates supported the New Directions effort. Today, delegates are scheduled elect top national and regional officers. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> faces no opposition to a third, three-year term. The convention also will elect two vice presidents to replace retiring vice presidents <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>. Later, <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> will assign the vice presidents to head the union's various departments, including one for each of the Big Three automakers and another with administrative responsibility for agricultural implement and aerospace workers covered by the union Despite the overwhelming loss Tuesday, New Directions leader <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> said he was happy with his troops and their reception. `` I think it was a good debate,'' he said. `` Debate on the floor today was healthy.'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> held out the possibility that there would be more from New Directions forces, especially next year when the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> plots its strategies for negotiations with the Big Three automakers. Contracts between the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expire Sept. 14, 1990. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said he was pleased with the way <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> handled the debate, which sometimes got a little rowdy, and hoped that delegates would take the New Directions message back to their locals. `` The rank and file will ultimately find ways to express themselves,'' he said. The loss Tuesday was the third by New Directions forces since the convention opened Sunday. It winds up Friday. During the first two days of the convention, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directions </ORGANIZATION> backers failed in an attempt to require rank-and-file referendum voting for top national officers, instead of a vote by convention delegates, and lost a credentials fight for seating some delegations. Members of the movement made a loud entrance to the convention hall Tuesday. About 250 delegates and alternates paraded in carrying signs and shouting: `` What do we need? New Directions. When do we want it? Right now.'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> ignored the parade as it passed in front of the stage. Delegate <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> of Local 653 in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, stood on a chair in front of <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, waved a New Directions placard and shouted, `` We do n't have to go to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; Injustice is right here.'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> watched the demonstration from the stage. When asked how it made him feel, he said, `` Bigger.''

 Stock prices moved higher Wednesday as the market seemed unperturbed by the fall of the pound and a nationwide transportation strike. Volume was low as today's national rail strike, combined with a walkout by subway and bus drivers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, left many brokerages and institutions understaffed. Much of the trading volume was in the pharmaceutical and electronics sectors, dealers said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index was up 11.6 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,176.4 at midday. Volume was a scant 176.1 million shares. The pound was quoted at $ 1.5345 and 3.0514 West German marks around midday Wednesday, down from $ 1.5475 and 3.0632 marks late Tuesday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, who would become the new deposit insurance czar under legislation moving through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is conferring with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration about an idea that would enhance his power over the savings and loan bailout. Under the plan, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would have greater authority than originally envisioned by the administration within the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a new agency being created to oversee the closing or sale of insolvent thrift institutions and of real estate repossessed by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls. Under bills passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> will be run by a board headed by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. It would have an oversight staff, headed by an executive director. But, as the administration envisions the structure, most of the work would be contracted out, presumably to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. According to an industry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> wants the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to report directly to the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> oversight board rather than through a staff working for the board. Ultimate authority would still rest with the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> board, but without the separate staff there would be less opportunity for administration second-guessing of <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>'s agency. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> _ not the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> board _ in practice would choose which private firms are hired for the lucrative job of assisting the government in the huge undertaking. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, in a telephone interview Tuesday, declined to say his agency is advocating the idea, but he described it as `` worth exploring'' and `` feasible.'' `` It's not our idea. It came from a suggestion that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- made. We have been talking to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> about it,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, under legislation that passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in April, will have the mammoth task of spending $ 50 billion in new bailout funds and of handling $ 300 billion to $ 500 billion of bad loans and property. That would make it, if it were private, the largest corporation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The legislation does not spell out how the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> will be structured beyond the composition of its board and the fact that it must hire a chief executive officer. It does not define the relationship between the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and RTC. However, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> has said he does not want his agency to get expanded responsibility without added authority to control the conditions and terms under which it does the additional work. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said if the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> were not given the added authority, and were simply a contractor of the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, it would want to pick and choose what S & amp; L liquidation work it wanted. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> said the administration has planned all along for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to take the lead role in disposing of failed S & amp; Ls. At issue, he said, is the vigor of administration oversight. `` No one likes the idea of a full-time person overseeing them. But our view is we're required to have oversight,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> `` wants as much independence as -LRB- it -RRB- can get, but there's a limit as to what can be done on that.''

 H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings jumped 15.2 percent as its sales increased 11 percent. The food company reported earnings of $ 117.2 million, or 89 cents per share, in the quarter ended May 3, compared with $ 101.6 million, or 77 cents per share, for the same period a year earlier.

Improved volume in Italian baby food and Weight Watchers brand food products, primarily in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, and higher prices contributed to the sales increase, the company said. Net income for the full fiscal year increased 14 percent to $ 440 million, or $ 3.34 per share, compared with $ 386 million, or $ 2.91 per share, for fiscal 1988. Sales for the year totaled $ 5.8 billion, a 10.6 percent gain from $ 5.2 billion recorded in 1988. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said the sales increase was due to price increases, significant volume gains, and acquisitions in the pet food area and foreign markets.

The same workers face a wider array of employer-sponsored savings plans, and are increasingly being asked to take a more active role in designing their own benefits packages. `` There is a desire among employers to involve employees more in all aspects of benefits,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a partner in <ORGANIZATION> Hewitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, the suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> consulting firm that conducted the survey of 227 major employers. `` There's a sense that when employees participate, they get involved more and have a greater appreciation'' for their benefits, <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Lincolnshire </LOCATION> office. The study will be released publicly early next month, said <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. Medical plans are paying more catastrophic-illness costs but employees are paying a larger share of other medical expenses, researchers discovered. <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> found that just 29 percent of the survey respondents' medical plans covered 100 percent of hospital room and board charges, compared with 53 percent in 1984 The more typical practice is for the plan to cover 80 percent of hospital charges and require employees to pay 20 percent up to a specified maximum, usually $ 2,000 or less. The plan then kicks in and pays 100 percent. Employers also are trying to better manage medical costs by encouraging employees to seek second surgical opinions and have medical tests done on an outpatient basis. In 1984, <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> found that 62 percent of companies surveyed offered the same medical coverage for surgery whether or not the employee got a second opinion. In 1988, only 29 percent of the respondents offered the same coverage regardless of whether a second opinion was obtained. `` Cost-sharing causes people to be more careful consumers of health-care services,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. `` The employee who has to pay for part of any service they use is going to use more discretion.'' The survey revealed a dramatic increase _ from 56 percent in 1984 to 82 percent in 1988 _ in the prevalence of employer-sponsored 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plans. These optional savings plans usually supplement traditional pension plans and offer tax benefits superior to individual retirement accounts. Among retirement savings plans, the survey found a trend toward more investment options such as company stock, stock-market mutual funds and guaranteed-income instruments. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said retirement savings options have grown in response to the changing demographics of the work force, which was once composed mainly of married men with families but now includes large numbers of both sexes, married and single, some with children, some without. `` We have a work force with a much broader diversity of needs,'' he said. `` Some have high retirement-income needs, some have low-retirement income needs.'' In addition to providing a new way for employees to set aside money for retirement, a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- plan `` takes some of the pressure off of employers to funnel more dollars into the pension plan, no doubt about it,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened slightly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, continuing a retreat prompted by forecasts for scattered thunderstorms in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Traders are keeping a close watch on weather conditions in western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and southwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where rain was expected today. The threat of precipitation _ with expected amounts ranging from \ inch to 1 -LCB- inches _ is alleviating the drought fears that prompted a strong rally in the crop markets during the past week. Prices began falling on Tuesday. The showers are expected to move across the <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION> over the next several days, with clearing skies and cooler temperatures predicted for the weekend. The wheat market continued to be pressured by selling linked to harvest activity in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and uncertainty over U.S.-China relations. Some experts fear tensions between the two countries may impede sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In early trading, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 1 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.94 a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.65 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 cents lower with July at $ 1.67 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 4 \ cents lower with July at $ 7.33 a bushel Cattle futures were little changed while pork futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 A wildcat strike inflamed by two shootings spread to more than 35,000 miners in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> by today after thousands of miners in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> joined the work stoppage. At least 40 <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> mines reported a total of more than 8,000 miners who failed to show up for work, and hundreds more joined the walkout in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. But employees at four small <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mines returned to work at midnight Tuesday after the release of three jailed union leaders. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported that the railroad's coal loadings were down about 1,000 cars per day because of the strike, putting 300 workers at least temporarily off the job `` If the strike continues and spreads, the jobs of as many as 2,500 employees could be affected,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Walston </PERSON> estimated the miners' strike has reduced by by 15 percent the number of cars loaded daily by the company Some union and industry officials had predicted an end to the walkouts with the release of the union leaders jailed in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> for their actions in a strike against the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, - based <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The three were released Monday night. On Tuesday, they promised a federal judge they would abide by his order banning sit-down demonstrations to block coal trucks at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> plants. But today, more than 200 cars and pickups drove up and down the roads in front of the entrances to the plants, continuing a convoy tactic that resulting in the ticketing of 22 people Tuesday for impeding traffic. Nearly 1,700 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members walked off their <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> jobs in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on April 5 after working more than 14 months without a contract. The strike spread to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> operations Monday, idling 200 more <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> had dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate independently. The unauthorized walkouts began June 12 after a UMW rally in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> to protest <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s action and to protest the fines and jail terms assessed union members in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Shootings were reported Tuesday in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Sumiton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacks </PERSON> said a coal truck was hit by five bullets. He said the driver, whom he refused to identify, was not struck by any of the .22 - caliber rounds, but did complain of grittiness in his eyes, possibly caused from the broken The truck belongs to Black and <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION>, an independent Sumiton company. <PERSON> Jacks </PERSON> said the shooting was strike-related and police were investigating, but no arrests had been made. `` At this time, we are working closely with some union people to try to get some tempers down,'' Jacks said. `` I think we are making some gain and can come to a neutral standoff.'' In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where almost two-thirds of the wildcat strikers are located, strike-related gunshots were reported in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but no arrests were made and no one was reported injured. Wildcat strikers also headed to southwest <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coal fields to try to slow <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> coal shipments. `` They've just got the place saturated with people; it's pretty well blocked up,'' said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state police Lt. C.F. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>. One of the freed union leaders, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, field commander, said he's optimistic miners can beat <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said the wildcat strikers fear a <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> victory could set a precedent. `` They see what <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is doing as a threat to their unions,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is successful, it will directly affect their lives. A union official in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said the release of the union leaders may help take the steam out of the strike in his state. `` That's real helpful to me,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmons </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Local 1791, which represents 655 wildcat strikers. `` That is a step in the right direction in getting my people to work.'' Wildcat strikes also were being conducted in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> moved today to get a court order blocking <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 14 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount, an entertainment and publishing concern, has launched its own $ 10.7 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>, a leading magazine publisher and cable operator Time has rejected Paramount's bid. In trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> was up $ 3 a share to $ 155.50. Time had fallen more than $ 18 a share over the past three trading days since it launched its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and rejected <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was down 12 -LCB- cents a share at $ 59.37 -LCB- at midday while Paramount was down 75 cents a share at $ 58.62 -LCB-. In a revision of an earlier suit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> asked for an order voiding the Time tender offer and merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. It also asks for nullification of any vote to elect directors at <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, which is scheduled for June 30. Among the directors up for election are Time's chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>, and its president, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Time said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations in the new complaint were `` without merit'' and said the amended complaint `` appears to be designed to provide copy for the press rather than to make a case before a court. Time stock, which was trading at $ 126 before <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> announced its bid June 6, has climbed as high as $ 182.75 during the past two weeks. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Appert </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price could turn around again if the market perceives that the advantage in the struggle for Time was shifting toward Paramount. Time stock has fallen because investors believe `` the odds are greater or improving that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> is going to succeed with its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'' and that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for Time will fail, <PERSON> Appert </PERSON> said. But, <PERSON> Appert </PERSON> said, the market had no concrete information or developments to support its speculation, and it was still widely expected that courts in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ where all three companies are incorporated _ ultimately would decide the outcome of the takeover fight. Paramount has bid $ 175 a share for Time, which rejected the offer and said it would continue to pursue a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> announced it was revising its earlier stock-swap merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and was launching a $ 70-a-share tender offer for the company. Time contends the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> offer is uncertain because it is dependent on obtaining financing and because <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> must obtain regulatory approval before it can acquire the franchises to about 800 cable television systems <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> owns. <PERSON> Appert </PERSON> said the takeover fight could turn on whether Time, in agreeing to the merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in March, effectively put itself up for sale. If the courts decide that is the case, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> directors could be forced to seek the highest price for the company's stock and the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> bid might then succeed. Wall Street _ in depressing <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s stock _ is betting the courts will side with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and allow the directors to pursue an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, in filings with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> charged that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for Time violates the 1984 Cable Act and FCC rules and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> told the commission it should set aside a ruling allowing Time to transfer control of its cable TV systems to <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount said Time had misrepresented to its stockholders the nature of the transfer and that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> had written to state attorneys general asking them to oppose <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal without notifying Paramount of the letters. These actions raise `` questions about Time's character qualifications,'' <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said, asking the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to set aside its approval of the license transfers pending an investigation. Paramount earlier this month asked the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> for permission to give control of Time to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> pending <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and licenses held by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Tuesday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s request `` would violate the recent Cable Act because <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> has n't gotten consent from any of these cities for the <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, echoing assertions Time made against <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> in a June 13 <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> filing, said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s plan would `` undermine the delicate balance'' established in the 1984 Cable Act for regulation of cable systems by local authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> late Monday to deny the application made by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> KDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for expedited consent to transfer control of Time to <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> and then to Paramount. In a separate development, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> canceled the June 23 shareholder's meeting it had scheduled for a vote on the original merger plan with Time. Time earlier had rescheduled its June 23 shareholders' meeting until June 30 and said it would deal with election of directers and nothing related to the merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the one-time stock baron at the center of Wall Street's fraud scandals, is pumping iron and growing a beard at a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> prison, a published report says. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> also is deeply tanned and jogs daily on the outdoor track at the minimum-security federal prison camp in <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> inc. </ORGANIZATION> magazine reports in its July issue. The 52-year-old former speculator in April completed one year of a three-year sentence for pleading guilty of conspiracy to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in connection with allegations of insider trading. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> paid the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> $ 100 million in alleged ill-gotten profits and penalties in late 1986 to settle charges he used illegal inside information to profit on securities deals. He was eligible for parole in March, but declined to apply. A federal judge recently rejected his appeal for a reduced sentence, and his earliest possible release date based on good behavior is April 4, 1990. Quoting unidentified visitors to <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> inc. said the convicted arbitrager whose confessions have spawned several other Wall Street fraud prosecutions has grown a full white beard and is `` impressively muscled.'' `` <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> works out every day at the outdoor weight area <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> provides inmates, and he has built himself up substantially,'' the magazine said. `` He jogs daily on <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>'s makeshift track.'' The magazine said that <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s bodybuilding `` is probably in part to insure that he is able to defend himself'' because he feared for his safety when he entered the prison 15 months ago.

 A group of semiconductor companies today announced the formation of a manufacturing corporation that expects to raise more than $ 1 billion over several years to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of memory chips. The plan, which sets up a corporation named <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, calls for the venture to be funded by microchip makers and their major customers. Companies which contributed `` seed money'' to form the corporation include <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and National Semiconductor. `` The time is right for a collective memory manufacturing venture in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to improve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s market position in what is truly a critical technology,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the newly formed corporation and a former vice president at <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. The venture is aimed at lessening the dependence on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for DRAMs, the dynamic random access memory chips that are important to computers, consumer electronics and advanced military hardware. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, which once led the DRAM business, account for about 15 percent of the $ 12 billion North American market. Another chip consortium, called <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>, researches new manufacturing technologies but can not build commercial products. It is funded with $ 100 million annually from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and an equal amount from 14 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chipmakers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memories is expected to begin by setting up a high-volume plant to make a new generation of DRAM that can store 4 million bits of information. Japanese companies are just beginning to ship samples of the four-megabit varieties that offer four times the storage of the one-megabit chips often found in personal computers. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has been organizing the consortium. `` Any consortium that brings together <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics companies to further our global advantage is a step in the right direction,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I find this to be a very positive step.''

 Japanese businessmen cautiously are returning to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, hoping to resume the business that they long have conducted in that market while remaining wary of another outbreak of unrest. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON> has criticized businessmen for returning too quickly _ saying they invited charges that they are `` trying to make money like a thief at a fire'' _ but the government has not formally asked firms to refrain from business. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been more cautious in its criticism of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which is pushing for the suspension of all new <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans to protest the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations two weeks ago. `` For the time being the Japanese government is not considering sanctions,'' but is continuing to gather information, Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Masajuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiokawa </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday. Nevertheless, on Tuesday Foreign Ministry officials said negotiations on a new five-year, $ 5.6 billion loan package to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were not being conducted, but <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would decide whether to resume talks after watching the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Sanctions by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could be more serious than sanctions by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is larger _ $ 19.3 billion last year _ and because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> provides 80 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign loans Prime Minister Sousuke Uno has expressed regret at the Chinese crackdown but so far has stressed maintaining good long-term ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He and other officials have cited <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s pre-World War II invasion of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a major reason for reluctance to criticize the Chinese government. The government's cautious attitude has been criticized as too weak by some of the Japanese press and some business leaders. But many businessmen want the government to help smooth resumption of business. They fear that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions could harm the general business environment and the suspension of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans could hurt <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ability to conduct trade with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut trade ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` some Japanese companies might take up the slack,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> VanDenBerg </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` However, it's unlikely they would take up the slack in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> direct investment in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions would be a disincentive for anyone else to invest,'' she said. The Chinese government has been trying to woo foreign businessmen back with reassurances that its economic open-door policy remains intact. Some traders say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> even has speeded up the normally glacial paperwork required to do business. Japanese traders view these assurances with skepticism, but like many Americans are trying to maintain business ties while carefully watching the situation, said <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasahara </PERSON>, general manager of the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> department at <ORGANIZATION> Marubeni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. Major trading houses have sent limited numbers of staff back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to carry out existing contracts and monitor the situation, said a trader who declined to be named. Trading houses said that even at the height of the unrest, shipments in and out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> did not stop, although there were some slowdowns. Production at a number of joint-venture factories far from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> were undisturbed by events in the capital. Japanese banks and securities houses do not plan to send staff back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for now, while a number of manufacturers plan to proceed with plans for joint ventures, <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Kumagai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumi </PERSON>, a major construction company, said it has not resumed work on a 51-story <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> building stopped during the unrest. `` We're not sure yet if there are workers and materials available,'' said <PERSON> Makoto </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON>, a company spokesman. None of the company employees who were evacuated have returned to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and it is unclear if they will, he said. But <ORGANIZATION> Yokogawa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, a major electrical machinery manufacturer, said its joint venture factory in <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION> resumed production last week following a temporary shutdown during the unrest. Half of the Japanese China-based staff have returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the company hopes to send the rest back later, said <PERSON> Tatsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ando </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Yokogawa </ORGANIZATION>'s public relations office. `` We have a very long history in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and we are not considering fundamentally rethinking our plans in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> just because of recent events,'' <PERSON> Ando </PERSON> said.

 Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly mixed Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with rainy weather helping to buoy up wheat prices and depress the corn and soybean markets. Rain is slowing the winter wheat harvest in the Southeast but aiding newly planted corn and soybeans in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Scattered showers were expected to spread eastward from western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> over the next couple days, ending about a week of dry weather in the Corn Belt. Wheat prices fell early in the session on rumors of a possible embargo on grain to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but closed higher after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they did not plan to cut off grain sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to protest the executions of pro-Democracy dissidents.

 A <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> frozen food company known mainly for its chicken and barbecue is selling its new Japanese food in a crowded market _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But the overseas competition does n't worry <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is exploiting it's product's cost advantages to carve a niche in the market. `` It's cheaper to produce in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Savannah-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H Food. `` Our labor is cheaper. Our costs of goods are cheaper. And even if you add in the shipping charges, it's still cheaper. Since Hall's company was established in 1981, it has produced chicken and dumplings, chicken pot pies, pork barbecue and such frozen rice dishes such as seafood and catfish gumbos. In 1987, <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H joined <ORGANIZATION> Nitto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading Japanese food manufacturer, and <ORGANIZATION> Nozaki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Japanese trading company, in forming <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Nitto sent <PERSON> Hideo </PERSON> <PERSON> Saga </PERSON>, a consultant for a Japanese company with which <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H markets the U.S.-made frozen dinners, to <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> to develop test products, including `` beef-rice,'' a popular Japanese dish of rice, beef and vegetables <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s 50 employees ship 80,000 pounds of cooked beef a month to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the maximum allowed under a government-set quota. The beef, cooked and packed in six-pound pouches, is used in various Nitto products. Pro Foods also ships 40,000 pounds of frozen beef-rice a month, packed in plastic pouches that can be heated in boiling water or microwave ovens. To assure the authenticity of the dish, the rice is steamed in a Japanese rice cooker resembling a large safe, complete with a wheel to bolt it shut. Another Japanese machine keeps the beef slices to a thickness of between 1.5 and 2.5 millimeters, a tolerance specified by <PERSON> Nitto </PERSON>. A third Japanese machine known as a nitrogen tunnel cools the beef-rice pouches to minus-10 degrees Fahrenheit. The blast of nitrogen keeps the rice from clumping when heated and served. `` We send it to small restaurants and cafeterias. The people in the back know it was made in <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, but not the customers,'' said Saga. Saga, who spent six years developing frozen and canned foods in <LOCATION> Nitto </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yamagata </LOCATION> headquarters, has been assigned permanently to <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>. He is one of two Japanese quality control consultants at Pro Foods. Nitto sends a new assistant every three months. Japanese consumers eat rice about three times a day, but have to pay about five times more than their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts, said Saga. To protect growers, the Japanese government bars imports of cheaper foreign rice but permits foods containing rice. Beef, the second-most popular meat in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after fish, must be imported because the Japanese can not produce enough to meet demand, said <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. As a result, the wholesale price of beef is $ 8 to $ 12 a pound in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, compared to about $ 3.50 a pound for prime filet mignon at American grocery stores, he said. Saga is developing additional products for Pro Foods to export. His countrymen like Italian food, but probably would not enjoy chili and tacos, he said. Saga also does n't see a future for Hall's catfish gumbo, because in Japanese mythology catfish are thought to cause earthquakes. `` There are many catfish in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but they are never eaten,'' <PERSON> Saga </PERSON> said. Hall believes there are many untapped opportunities for small companies such as <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; H that want to sell to the Japanese. But the firms will have to supply products that meet their needs and specifications. `` The future is in small ventures,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` There are 124 million Japanese living in an area the size of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. They all eat, they all sleep and they all drink ... The items that can be manufactured here to Japanese specifications are just unlimited.''

 <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that they have moved back to Dec. 31 the deadline for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> to buy the Richmond-based pharmaceutical company. Under the orginal purchase agreement, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> could terminate the purchase and withdraw from the Chapter 11 reorganization of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> if all appeals of the plan were not cleared up by July 26. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> is purchasing <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> through a $ 700 million stock swap. Last week, the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> affirmed a lower court ruling approving the reorganization plan. Part of the plan includes a $ 2.5 billion trust fund to pay off the claims of nearly 200,000 women who claimed physical injury from the use of the Robins' Dalkon Shield intrauterine birth control device. Both <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> and <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the pharmaceutical company, said the extension of the termination date would allow sufficient time for any appeals of the appeals court decision. `` We would like to get on with the completion of our acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> said. `` We believe doing so promptly would be in the best interests of all concerned. If no appeals of the orders ... are taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, our present anticipation is that the transaction will be complete early in the fourth quarter of this year.'' <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> sought federal bankruptcy protection in 1985 in the wake of mounting claims from the use of the Dalkon Shield, marketed by the company in the mid-1970s. Women who used the IUD said they suffered injuries ranging from internal bleeding to sterility. After three years of hearings, the reorganization plan was approved by federal District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and later by <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' creditors. That approval was challenged by attorneys representing some of the claimants, who argued votes from women who claimed the greatest injury should be given a greater weight than other claimants.

 The dollar ended lower against all major currencies in thin, nervous trading Wednesday following a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices rose sharply in reaction to the decline. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said the late bid for a troy ounce of gold was $ 371.25 a troy ounce, up $ 6.25 from Monday. Currency dealers said the dollar started out stronger overseas but slipped back after failing to sustain higher levels that are important to chart-watching analysts. The decline accelerated following reports of quiet dollar-selling intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, they said. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said traders also were concerned that interest rates may soon rise overseas, especially after the European parliamentary elections, depressing the dollar's value. He said that feeling was underlined by remarks from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank indicating dissatisfation with the recent high dollar levels. Trading was particularly quiet in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where markets were affected by strikes on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s railways and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s buses and subways. Some dealing rooms in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> operated with skeleton staffs and very little business was seen during the day. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the pound. One British pound cost $ 1.54675, down from $ 1.5553 Tuesday. Sterling fetched $ 1.5553 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from $ 1.5405. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before the European markets open, the dollar closed at 144.95, up 1.15 yen from Tuesday. The dollar traded slightly lower at 144.90 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 142.55 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from 144.90. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday's rates, included: 1.9610 West German marks, down from 1.9870; 1.6905 Swiss francs, down from 1.7205; 1.19325 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19875; 6.6565 French francs, down from 6.7315; and 1,423.50 Italian lire, down from 1,440.00 Late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Tuesday's late rates: 1.9680 West German marks, down from 1.9775; 1.7005 Swiss francs, down from 1.7110; 6.6795 French francs, down from 6.7025; 2.2375 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2255; 1,439.50 Italian lire, up from 1.431.75; and 1.19675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2000.

<HEAD>Hooker Selling Stakes in U.S. Stores; Shopping Malls to Be Sold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian property developer and retailing concern, hopes it can quickly accomplish a plan to sell stakes in its American stores and sell shopping malls it owns in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> executive said Wednesday. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Haasbeek </PERSON>, president of L.J. <ORGANIZATION> Hooker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Atlanta-based holding company for <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, said <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> wants to act swiftly in arranging the sales, which are aimed at lightening the company's debt load. `` We would like to accomplish a lot in the next three to six months,'' <PERSON> Haasbeek </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> announced earlier this week that it is seeking joint venture partners to invest in its Bonwit Teller department store chain, <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> stores, <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON> and Parisian stores. The Merksamer Jewelers chain, which is 80 percent owned by <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, has been put on the sale block by <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> and the other owners. <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> also said it will divest its <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fashion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> Town Center outside <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. In addition, partners are being sought to invest in malls <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> plans to build in <LOCATION> Cary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A 20-story office tower <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> has under construction in midtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, called 10 <ORGANIZATION> Peachtree </ORGANIZATION>, also will be sold. <PERSON> Haasbeek </PERSON> declined to identify parties that have expressed interest in investing in Hooker's department stores or buying the shopping malls. He said the malls have attracted many potential purchasers and <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> is negotiating with a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> builder about making an investment in the sites on which <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> plans to construct new shopping malls. Announcement of the planned sales followed word from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, Australia-based Hooker in late May that it intended to sell $ 750 million of holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to raise badly needed cash. Much of <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>'s financial difficulty stems from three years of rapid expansion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing and real estate development, a recent slowdown in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail sales, a sharp rise in Australian interest rates and tightened credit. Since 1986, <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> has acquired: Bonwit Teller and <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, department stores located in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; 80 percent of <PERSON> Sakowitz </PERSON>, a small chain of department stores based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; a majority interest in <LOCATION> Parisian </LOCATION>, a chain operating in the South based in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; and 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Merksamer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewelers </ORGANIZATION>, a string of jewellery stores with headquarters in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. At a meeting in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> asked about 40 creditor banks to support a four-month moratorium on principal payments on its loans <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> would pay only interest during the period. The lenders were asked to decide by Friday whether they would agree to the temporary reprieve for <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>. After Wednesday's meeting, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grellman </PERSON> of the accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Peat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marwick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hungerfords </ORGANIZATION>, an adviser to <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>, said there is `` a general level of support'' for the moratorium proposal among <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>'s creditors. If the creditors go along with a postponement in principal payments, <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON> will draw up a restructuring plan within three months for approval by the lenders. <PERSON> Grellman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>'s directors remain in charge of running operations and all <PERSON> Hooker </PERSON>'s businesses continue to be operated as usual.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> sipped a glass of water and briefly closed his bloodshot, travel-weary eyes. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s trade minister knew the questions were coming over how the blood spilled in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> would wound the freewheeling British colony that becomes part of Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> eight years from now. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> predicted any wounds would heal, but admitted uncertainty about what looms ahead. `` Those were very sad events indeed,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> during a visit that followed the Chinese government's crackdown on a pro-democracy movement. `` It is time to be humble about our lack of knowledge about what is going on in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' For the frenetic territory of free enterprise that sits like a fragile egg along the southern Chinese frontier, the bloodletting fractured a veneer of confidence that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will permit <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to maintain its way of life for 50 years after the 1997 takeover, as promised under a historic Sino-British pact. The June 3-4 killings and their aftermath devastated prices in the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> stock market, weakened property values, led to record requests for emigration visas and drained bank vaults as many depositors spirited their money abroad, fearing more turmoil. Even <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> optimists began to quietly question whether <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> made a grave mistake five years ago by agreeing to surrender the colony, a vestige of the Opium War days that has since blossomed into one of the most fabulously successful industrial and financial centers of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. For Chan, a 46-year-old, native-born <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Chinese who speaks flawless British-accented English, the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crackdown and its impact on the colony have presented the greatest challenge of his career and personal life. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> must try to convince Americans and other foreigners with billions of dollars invested in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> that their money and property not only are safe but will grow in value in the pre-takeover years and beyond. He also must try to persuade <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s 6 million people to hope, to trust that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will honor its pledge to basically leave them alone after the scarlet hammer & amp; sickle flag replaces <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s union jack on July 1, 1997, the official termination of British authority under their joint declaration `` What gives the Sino-British agreement its teeth is that it's a binding agreement,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said during his trip earlier this month to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he expounded on the virtues of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s economy to lawmakers and business groups, and rejected suggestions that the territory is doomed. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has an excellent track record of honoring its international commitments,'' he said. `` Even in the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese honored their agreements. They kept <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> supplied with food and water.'' In his view, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> not only will protect <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s way of life, but will continue exhorting its entrepreneurs to share their expertise with the rest of the country. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> is a senior native <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> member of the British administration and has been a career colonial official for the past 25 years, with posts that have ranged from government spokesman to the governor's private secretary. Perhaps for that reason, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> has no choice but to put the best face on a potentially explosive problem and has gone out of his way to show he wants to stay in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, whether he really believes in its future or not. He was deeply involved in the negotiations that climaxed with the Sino-British agreement in 1984 and is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Sino-British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a body established under the agreement to oversee the sale and allocation of property in the years up to 1997. In March 1987 he became deputy chief secretary and was responsible for formulating constitutional reforms aimed at giving <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> a democratically elected government prior to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> takeover. He became trade and industry secretary this past March. His responsibilities now include <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s international trading relations and its involvement in world commercial organizations, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Unlike his British colleagues, however, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> does not have a British passport or right of residence in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. He grew up and went to school in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. He lives there with his wife and two children. He just purchased an apartment in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and said he does not keep any overseas bank accounts. `` My family and I remain committed to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I was born here, my father was born here.'' <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, he said, `` is not <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It is not going to be run by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It will be run by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people under the agreement.'' Nonetheless, events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> over the past few weeks have jolted many other <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people into concluding that the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government has no regard for international opinion when confronted with a threat to its political supremacy. In their view, if <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> eventually is seen by the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as a destabilizing influence on the rest of the country, it would use whatever means necessary to fortify itself at <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s expense. This scenario strikes the deepest fear into the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government because it raises the possibility of chaos. Many <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents are refugees of past <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> political convulsions and now have no place to go. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has made no special arrangements to accept them. For that reason, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> and other members of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s colonial administration recently began to press <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to reconsider its immigration policy concerning <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has a moral obligation to the people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said. `` They want to acquire an insurance policy, a home of last resort, if things really turn bad.'' The lukewarm response of the British thus far, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said, `` indicates this is not an easy matter for them.'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> admitted he is not a trained Sinologist and the stunning crackdown on political dissidents in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> took him by surprise. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said, if it had to happen, he was grateful it happened in 1989, not 1996. `` One of the silver linings on this dark cloud is that it's given <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> people a hard shock _ like an injection, an immunization against the next rude shock,'' he said. As for his own future under the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> umbrella, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> smiled philosophically. `` If I do well in the next eight years,'' he said, `` maybe I'll get a promotion.

 The stock market gave ground for the third straight session Wednesday, faced with a declining dollar and rising interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.97 to 2,464.91, bringing its loss since the start of the week to 21.47 points. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 617 up, 842 down and 495 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 168.83 million shares, against 167.65 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 201.21 million shares. The dollar fell Wednesday afternoon against leading foreign currencies. And prices of long-term government bonds dropped about $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the 8.33 percent-8 .35 percent range Many Wall Streeters lately have speculated that stock prices might be due for a pause or pullback after their strong advance since late last year. Analysts said a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report on economic conditions around the country helped ease market concern that the central bank might need to drive interest rates higher but did n't inspire stock-buying enthusiasm. The report, known as the `` beige book,'' indicated that growth is slowing and inflationary pressures have eased in response to an anti-inflation campaign waged by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>.

 Share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed firmer on Wednesday despite further signs of weakness in sterling and the disruption to trading caused by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first national rail strike since 1982.

The pound fell sharply overnight, though it recovered somewhat later in the day, helped by modest intervention by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The Stock Exchange shortened the trading session about an hour because of the chaotic traffic conditions in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as a result of the strike. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 7.4 points, or 0.3 percent, higher at 2,172.2.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board member pleaded guilty Wednesday to illegally passing on confidential interest rate data in the first insider trading case involving government securities. In a plea agreement, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> A. Rough, 50, pleaded guilty to a single bank fraud charge and the government in exchange dropped two insider trading charges and four related counts. Rough admitted leaking confidential data while he served as a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board member from 1982 to 1984 to a securities firm that made about $ 50 million from the information. As part of the plea deal, prosecutors also agreed to recommend a prison term of under one year for the former banker. Rough faces a maximum five years in jail and $ 10,000 fine. Sentencing is set for Aug. 18. Rough's attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON>, said his client had sent letters of apology to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` To me, it's certainly a step in the right direction, an example of contrition,'' <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> called the apologies a `` good step.'' Rough admitted giving a <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> brokerage confidential data about the discount rate set by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and 11 sister regional banks make regular recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on the rate, which has a powerful bearing on government securities. Rough sat on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s board as president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Branchville </LOCATION>. He admitted leaking recommendations as well as advance word of a change in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate The allegations surfaced during the 1987 trial of a <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, president of the brokerage firm of <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bresler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Schulman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He and three other <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON> officials were imprisoned for the firm's $ 144 million collapse in 1985. Rough admitted that he passed on the data to <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, a longtime friend and business associate, and other principals. The government said the information allowed the firm to make an estimated $ 50 million in profits and avoid losses. In exchange, Rough allegedly received $ 47,000 in interest deferred loans. After the charges were disclosed, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightened its procedures regarding the discount rate. <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON> said Rough's disclosures were `` not done out of any motivation for greed or to line his pockets'' and blamed `` pumping and prodding by <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>.'' He claimed Rough probably would have received the loans from <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bresler </PERSON> regardless of whether he provided the information. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> had agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of Rough. <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON> said Rough, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, admitted the facts outlined in those charges even though he was not required to plead guilty to them. In pre-trial arguments, <PERSON> Himmel </PERSON> argued the discount rate data had no inherent material value and was not comparable to information about stocks. But <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> disagreed, ruling that insider trading laws could apply to Rough's case. The insider trading charges would have carried a fine of $ 100,000 per count.

 When <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> triumphantly led <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through a revolution a decade ago, oil output tumbled, world prices soared and shock waves hurt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy.

With the quick transfer of power to President ere have so far been no reports of instability that would threaten the flow of crude from one <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, thof the world's major producing nations. `` There does n't appear to be any civil disruptions which could unsettle the oil sector,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlotok </PERSON>, head of energy research at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The 1979 revolution, which brought <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to power and ended the reign of <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>, was marked by unrest in the oilfields and a sharp drop in production. World oil prices soared, roiling the economies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other indus recently that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could produce 3.5 million barrels a day without any problem. `` We want to keep onshore and offshore production capacity for the next five years at a level of 4 million barrels a day,'' he said. Repairing its damaged industry would boost the slumping economy. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> earned an estimated $ 9 billion last year from oil revenues, compared with $ 23.6 billion in 1977. With increased production and higher prices, 1989 earnings should climb to about $ 12 billion, analysts predict.

 Energy futures prices rose Wednesday, led by a rally in the heating oil market. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July heating oil contract jumped 2.29 cents to finish at 47.98 cents a gallon, while the August contract closed 2 cents higher at 48.07 cents a gallon. All other contracts posted healthy advances. Crude prices also made strong gains. The August contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, rose 43 cents to close at $ 19.31 a barrel. Contracts for later delivery showed similar increases. Among other refined oil products, meanwhile, unleaded gasoline for July fell 0.7 cent to 59.10 cents a gallon, but other contracts rose. Analysts said crude and heating oil prices got a strong boost from weekly <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> statistics that showed a sharp decline in stocks from last year's levels. Crude oil inventories plunged by 25.2 million barrels from 1988 and were off 1.2 million barrels for the week ended June 16, the <ORGANIZATION> API </ORGANIZATION> said. Heating oil stocks fell 11.5 million barrels from last year and 1.6 million barrels for the week, according to the API report released after the close of trading on Tuesday. `` After the APIs came out and people saw that heating oil was running so far below last year, those who had been cutting back started to look at buying it again,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, oil broker with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. Unleaded gasoline stocks, meanwhile, rose by about 63,000 barrels last week and by 819,000 barrels from 1988 levels.

<HEAD>Heller Resignation Sparks Rally In Precious Metals Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The resignation of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> sparked strong rallies in the gold, silver and platinum markets Wednesday amid uncertainty about his departure's impact on interest rates and inflation. On other markets, copper futures plummeted, cotton and heating oil surged, pork bellies plunged, and grains and soybeans were mixed. Gold futures prices rose $ 6.10 to $ 6.90 on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in August at $ 375.70 a troy ounce; silver settled 4.7 cents to 5.1 cents higher with July at $ 5.298 a troy ounce. Platinum finished $ 6.90 to $ 7.70 higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with July at $ 501.80 a troy ounce, the contract's first close above $ 500 since June 8. The news that <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> was leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to join the credit-card company <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> triggered heavy buying during the last 10 minutes of trading on all the precious-metals markets, which benefit from inflation worries. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s attempts to fight inflation by raising interest rates have generally been seen as effective. The propects of a change in the board's composition sent a buying panic through the precious-metals markets, which were already trading higher in reaction to a continued weakening of the dollar's value against other major currencies. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>'s resignation, while not likely to change the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s course, adds to the murkiness of recent economic indicators `` There are a lot of cross-currents out there and people are very uncertain about what is being said by the markets,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziemian </PERSON>, a precious-metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Analyst <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Platinum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a platinum trade association, said platinum's close above $ 500 an ounce signaled `` a real turning point'' for all the precious metals, which had been trending lower since late last year. But <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> saw no such signs in the gold market. `` The market is not showing any sort of independent strength,'' he said. Copper futures plummeted on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following news that the Canadian copper refiner <ORGANIZATION> Noranda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> had reached a new labor agreement with workers. Major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copper producers are also negotiating new labor contracts, and the <ORGANIZATION> Noranda </ORGANIZATION> settlement might portend easier going for those talks, <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said. Copper settled 6.2 cents to 8 cents lower with June at $ 1.077 a pound. Some cotton futures soared the 2 cents-a-pound daily limit on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid fears that persistent rain in the Southeast was hampering planting and care of the crop. Cotton settled .93 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 68.80 cents a pound. Heating oil futures skyrocketed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, partly on a weekly <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report that showed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of petroleum distillates had dropped by 1.6 million barrels last week. Heating oil settled 1.83 cents to 2.29 cents higher with July at 47.98 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 39 cents to 45 cents higher with August at $ 19.31 a barrel; unleaded gasoline was .07 cent lower to 1.06 cents higher with July at 59.10 cents a gallon. Frozen pork belly futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in line with weaker cash prices, which helped to drag down the related livestock markets. Frozen pork bellies settled .60 cent to .98 cent lower with July at 33.52 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent lower to .17 cent higher with July at 49.07 cents a pound; live cattle were .20 cent to .60 cent lower with August at 70.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .42 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at 81 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with rainy weather helping to support wheat prices and depress the corn and soybean markets. Wheat settled 1 \ cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.99 \ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with July at $ 2.65 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 5 \ cents lower with July at $ 1.63 a bushel; soybeans were 3 \ cents lower to 2 \ cents higher with July at $

 The champagne and string quartet are gone from the busy terminal at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and even <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> ca n't master the weather to make the flights run on time for his newly acquired <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle airline But passengers say they like the service and the Trump Shuttle meets their needs as business travelers _ for them, the frills are secondary. The billionaire developer launched his new airline two weeks ago with a blitz of trademark Trump glitz, soon after a federal bankruptcy judge approved his $ 365 million purchase of the New York-Washington-Boston shuttle from strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates a rival shuttle and gained a big chunk of business from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, concedes that curiosity about <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s new service has robbed it of some passengers _ at least for a while. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the shuttle market `` has definitely come down, as we expected,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. That share was around 75 percent two weeks ago but has slipped since <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s startup to 65 percent to 70 percent, she estimated But Trump Shuttle President <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> claims a bigger share for the new service, around 45 percent to 55 percent. `` I'm very pleased with the way the operation is running,'' he said Wednesday. <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> added that he has been disappointed by the recent run of unseasonably stormy weather in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, which has caused many delays and cancellations. On Wednesday, the Trump Shuttle terminal at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> was back to normal. The red and white balloons, Mozart-playing string quartet and buffet tables laden with champagne and finger food present for its inaugural day were gone, although new fresh plants and big red T's remained as permanent touches. Thunderstorms in the Northeast snarled the shuttle's hourly schedule and shattered <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s advertised claim for getting the flights off precisely on time. The red neon advisory warned of runway delays of up to 90 minutes. Passengers on the 7 a.m. EDT flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> LaGuardia </ORGANIZATION> did n't arrive until 10:40 a.m., after a detour to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, for refueling. Some of the travelers arriving at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> were exasperated but conceded that the weather is beyond even <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s control. `` I do n't know how Eastern would have handled it,'' said a young woman traveling on business to Mt. <PERSON> Kisco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> On Tuesday, with good weather, flights were running closer to schedule although still not always exactly on the hour as promised by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. The 7:40 a.m. New York-to-Washington run left only five minutes late and arrived 10 minutes early, while the 5 <ORGANIZATION> p.m. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> flight left only a few minutes late and arrived on time at 6 p.m. `` The service was fine; it's like any other airline,'' one young businessman said Wednesday. `` It did n't seem any different to me. It got me here, that's the main thing.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has promised his shuttle will be a `` diamond'' service, but a number of passengers indicated they cared more about transportation than about <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s planned refurbishing of the jets in burgundy and saddle-brown tones with chrome and maple wood veneer accents. On the outside, only four of Trump Shuttle's fleet of 21 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s have been repainted in the new color scheme: white fuselage with red, black and gold stripes, the word `` Trump'' above the stripes and a red ` T' on the tail. Except for a `` Trump'' hastily painted in red on the rest of the planes, they still sport the familiar Eastern silver and blue. The food is pretty much the same, too. On a recent morning flight the offering was a bagel, a dollop of cream cheese, a few grapes, a strawberry, half-frozen orange juice that had to be eaten with a spoon and coffee served in paper cups. Evening fare consisted of three pieces of barbecued chicken breast, corn-tomato salad and a slice of rye bread in a plastic box, along with free beer, wine and soft drinks. Most of the 1,000 or so Trump employees were formerly with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, and many of them are enthusiastic and visibly happy to be working again after more than three months on the picket line. `` It's a world of difference,'' said first officer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, an 18-year Eastern pilot, comparing the two airlines. `` Better working conditions, more flexible management.'' A young woman selling tickets at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>, also a former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employee, said, `` <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is a perfectionist. And now we get our paychecks on time!''

<TEXT>
 The government locked the doors of the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hempstead </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday morning and federal investigators said they would seek evidence of criminal behavior in the bank's failure. While <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents executed search warrants to look for evidence of fraud, 80 staffers from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> began the work of liquidating the bank and preparing checks for federally insured depositors, federal authorities said. In a related action, the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> ousted <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgagee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> GNMA </ORGANIZATION>'s program of mortgage-backed securities. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasper </PERSON>, executive vice president of GNMA, said his agency declared the New York Guardian in default and took over its multibillion-dollar portfolio because investors were not being fully paid. <PERSON> Gasper </PERSON> said beginning next month investors will be paid in full and on time and those shortchanged in the past would be reimbursed. `` We believe there will be substantial losses that the government will have to make up here and we will do so promptly,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said investigators obtained search warrants based on allegations of self-dealing and misuse of bank resources. They cited transactions made by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> and the largest shareholder of <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said that among the allegations was that <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> was involved in a sham divestiture in which $ 5.4 million was improperly transferred from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guardian </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Mebco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION>. The Swiss bank than lent $ 5 million to <ORGANIZATION> LBB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a company owned by <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> LBB </ORGANIZATION> bought <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> and another <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 1 million. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, said an announcement would be made in a few days about when checks covering insured deposits would be issued to the bank's 12,000 depositors. All deposits are insured by the government up to $ 100,000. Customers with accounts of more than $ 100,000 will receive $ 100,000 and a certificate for the balance that represents a claim against whatever assets remain after the bank liquidation, <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> said. The bank was declared insolvent by <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marriott </PERSON>, senior deputy comptroller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Guardian Bank came under the scrutiny of the comptroller's office in 1984 because of what the government described as deteriorating asset quality, poor earnings and declining capital. Despite prodding to correct the problems, the losses continued and the bank went under with assets of $ 420 million and deposits of $ 390 million, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1973 as <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a minority-owned company. Other stockholders took control in a proxy fight in 1976 and in 1979 <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> bought the bank, merged it with his mortgage company and changed its name.

 The leader of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union dissident group lost a bid Wednesday to stay on the union's <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, and the man who defeated him said the dissident movement is dying <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> 5, lost a re-election bid to <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>, a member of Local 249 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. In sometimes-noisy regional caucus balloting, <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> received 438.351 votes and <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> got 233.627. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who became a regional director last year in a federally supervised election, said he had not decided whether to go to court to challenge the convention delegate elections that led to Wednesday's vote. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> said delegates from the eight-state region `` saw through the New Directions movement. They saw they had questions but no answers. `` I think it's the beginning of the end for the New Directions movement.'' The blow was the latest <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s forces have received at the convention, which concluded Friday. Delegates rejected three New Directions-backed resolutions; at no time did New Directions get more than an estimated 20 percent in the show-of-hands votes. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, who ran the Region 5 caucus and the Tucker-Wyse election, said afterward that he was happy with the results. There was a possibility that New Directions forces could attempt from the convention floor Thursday to have the delegate elections set aside. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and his slate of national candidates were declared elected to lead the 1 million-member union after no other candidates were nominated. The election showed endorsement of the policies <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> has charted since becoming <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> president in 1983. The election came during the fourth day of the union's weeklong triennial constitutional convention. The <ORGANIZATION> Anaheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was festooned with balloons, signs and <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> members sporting buttons, hats and jackets emblazoned with their candidates' names. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s movement has been pressing <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and the Administration Caucus he leads to dump recently enacted joint labor-management agreements. It's the most serious challenge to union leadership in 40 years since the early days of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuther </PERSON>'s 24-year tenure as <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> president. `` This group was perhaps better organized than -LRB- dissident -RRB- groups of the past,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said during an impromptu news conference Wednesday. But <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said he expected the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> to emerge united from the convention. `` There has always been ample room to debate the issues,'' he said. Joining <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> in the union's leadership ranks as vice presidents were incumbents <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Odessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kommer </PERSON>. The delegates elected two new vice presidents: <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> 1C in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lofton </PERSON>, director of Region 1A in a part of metropolitan <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. The delegates also re-elected <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON>. Each officer will serve a three-year term. None of the candidates faced any opposition. Incumbent vice presidents <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> are retiring. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> also will assign the vice presidents to head the union's various departments, including one for each of the Big Three automakers and another with administrative responsibility for agricultural implement and aerospace workers covered by the union <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON> was expected to succeed <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON> as the head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the union's largest; <PERSON> Lofton </PERSON> to follow <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kommer </PERSON>, the union's most senior vice president, will remain in charge of a variety of smaller departments. After the nominations of <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON>, delegates staged an hour-long demonstration in which they paraded across the dais, shaking hands with the two leaders.

 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s cable television arm said Wednesday that local opposition is growing to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s cable franchises as part of its hostile $ 10.7 billion offer for the media giant <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is 82 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>, has said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of Time would be illegal because the change in control would place <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> in violation of many of its cable franchise agreements. It said officials from the states of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and 16 cities, including <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, have complained to federal officials that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover plan would abrogate the local right of prior approval for cable franchise ownership in their areas. <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, for instance, told the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in a letter that the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover plan `` is fundamentally at odds'' with <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION>'s franchise and local laws as well as federal laws on cable regulation It said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleaver </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the mayor pro tem of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in another letter, `` This intended action by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> unquestionably will violate the express terms of our cable television franchise.'' <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> also said that Paramount has indicated in a court filing in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> is based, that it will be unable to meet the July 5 deadline it set in its $ 175-a-share tender offer for Time. Time had said in rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s offer last week that the bid was highly conditional and subject to delays. Asked for a response, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said it intends to extend the expiration date of its tender offer until after <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> issues a decision in a suit <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> filed Wednesday against Time. Both companies are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. On the issue of the cable franchises, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to get cable franchise approval `` where required by state and local law in an orderly and expeditious way.'' <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is the nation's second-largest cable operator. with about 4.1 million subscribers.

<HEAD>Kentucky Fried Chicken To Install Computers for `Smart Kitchens'</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced its latest recipe Wednesday in the fast-food competition: a `` smart kitchen'' built on personal computers from <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and software from <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> will not only be able to say, ` We do chicken right,' it will also be able to say ` We do it intelligently,''' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION>'s personal computer division. The $ 19.5 million system will use <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION>'s OS-2 software to control data in virtually every operation of the 1,262 company-owned stores, from the front counter and kitchen to inventory and sales. The system will also be offered to franchise holders who run another 3,600 <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> outlets. The first three installations in the $ 19.5 million contract will be this summer in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, with complete `` rollout'' to all stores expected in early 1991, said <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> KFC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of information resources. As a management tool, the `` smart kitchen'' eliminates much of the guesswork involved in the $ 5 billion annual sales based on pressure-cooked fried chicken with `` 11 secret herbs and spices.'' Ultimately, the computer system will keep a minute-by-minute record of sales, employee hours, a running inventory of all supplies, and a 10-week sales history, among other things. It will also track the supply of cooked chicken and side dishes on hand, tell management when to cook more and when to discard food that is past its prime. For customers, the computerization will cut time spent in line about 3 percent and make it easier to change orders, said the company, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.
