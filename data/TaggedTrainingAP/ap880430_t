 The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> had a winning ticket but no winners in the fledgling <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery's first computerized numbers game. A photo at the top of the front page of Friday morning's newspaper showed the numbers 8-0-6, which turned out to be the winning combination in the first Cash 3 contest that night The photo, used to illustrate a story about the lottery, was of a sample ticket sent to the paper a month ago. `` This was entirely coincidental,'' City Editor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. `` It does n't seem like that should need to be said, but we've gotten so many calls. The first daily contest produced 859 winners but none in the Times newsroom. `` In fact, I do n't know anyone that played daily game in the newsroom,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. A spokesman for the lottery said the first Cash 3 game drawing went off without a hitch. Pingpong balls with the winning numbers were selected in only 60 seconds. The payout totaled $ 94,090. Ticket sales are expected to top $ 10 million in the first week. By 7:30 p.m. Friday, $ 616,543 had been wagered on Cash 3 and $ 345,377 on the jackpot Lotto game. Thirty-five percent of all lottery revenues are earmarked for public education. The first Lotto drawing will be held May 7. The prize will be at least $ 2 million but could reach $ 4 million. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> joins 27 other states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> that have legalized lotteries. Law enforcement officials hope the legalized <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> numbers games will help undermine illegal numbers rackets.

 Juveniles cause more than 60 percent of the crime in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> the crimes they commit are becoming more violent, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jian </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delinquency </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the rate of juvenile crime is 12 per 10,000 of the same age group. He said that was more than double the overall crime rate of 5 per 10,000 people, but still much lower than in developed countries. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> gave no figures for juvenile crimes or what age group is classified as juveniles. He said youths who in the past mainly committed minor offenses such as petty thefts and fighting are now engaged in robberies, violent assaults and rapes. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> attributed the rise in juvenile crime to the lack of proper laws, the spread of pornography, the increasing numbers of working parents and divorce. Girls, mainly involved in hooliganism _ a general term for unsocial behavior _ or sex crimes, made up 18.6 percent of juvenile criminals in 1985, up from 10 percent in 1983, he said. <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> said juvenile delinquency would continue to rise in the near future and called for a national network to educate and prevent youths from committing crimes.

<BYLINE>Proposed Oil Deal Hinges On Saudi Assent</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> moved one major step closer today to an agreement that could slightly increase oil prices and set the stage for closer coordination with oil producers outside its ranks. But clinching the deal required the approval of oil ministers from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and its three <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> allies, who said they needed to consult their governments first. A meeting of all <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers was set for tonight at cartel headquarters, but it was not certain a final decision would be made then. Eight of the 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> agreed in a meeting that ended early today to a proposed 2 percent cut in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s total oil production, according to oil ministers from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The cuts would be for May and June only, said Venezuelan Oil Minister <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisanti </PERSON>. The Saudis earlier indicated they opposed production cuts, believing prices would rebound soon anyway since oil demand is likely to rise this summer. Saudi King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> said in a newspaper interview Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> should simply stick to its current set of production quotas, which often are exceeded. He did not explicitly rule out cuts as small as those proposed in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Besides <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the others saying they wanted to think it over were <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which is not party to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s existing agreement on production limits, was not expected to take part in the proposed cuts, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. The eight that tentatively accepted the deal this morning were <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. The proposal was put on the table by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. The proposed cuts in output, in conjunction with similarly small cuts by a group of six independent oil-producing nations, would remove a total of 500,000 barrels a day from the world oil market. The goal is to lift oil prices to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s target of $ 18 a 42-gallon barrel from the range now of between $ 14 and $ 16. Oil prices on the open market moved erratically in nervous trading Friday. Prices fell more than 60 cents a barrel in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but recovered in later <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, June contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grade of oil, closed at $ 17.99 a barrel, up one cent from Thursday. At one point, the price was off 43 cents but then recovered. The proposed <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cuts are so small that analysts said the main effect on the market would be psychological. For <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, the principal benefit would be establishing closer ties to rival oil producers, who in recent years have weakened <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> by taking away its market share. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC producers have never before formally agreed to mutual cuts in production, although <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has informally sought to align its policies with <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. The non-OPEC countries involved in the current proposal are <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Representatives of these independent producers were in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> earlier this week for talks with a committee of six <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers. They left before <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting began Thursday, so it was not immediately clear if they would be satisfied with the proposed cut of 2 percent, or 300,000 barrels a day, in <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production. The non-OPEC group stipulated it would cut its oil exports by 5 percent, or 200,000 barrels a day, only if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> made `` similar, proportional'' reductions. It was not more precise about the reciprocity. Regardless of the outcome of the talks on production cuts, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> intended to step up contacts with the non-OPEC group in hopes of establishing a regular dialogue that could lead to more coordination of production and pricing policy in the future, several oil ministers said. `` We must send a positive signal to them,'' said <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON>, the oil minister of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Panamanian Opposition Angered by Reported Deal on Noriega</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Panamanian opposition leaders are reacting angrily to a proposed deal under which military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would resign his post but remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at least temporarily instead of going into exile. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials confirmed Friday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> agreed during negotiations with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to step down as commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> but that he had rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to persuade him to leave the country immediately after resigning. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is expected to step down in a matter of weeks and would prefer to live in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> if he is forced into exile. Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, a leader of the anti-Noriega forces in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, reacted sharply to word of the proposed agreement. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of going beyond its authority in trying to negotiate <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political future. That issue, he said in an interview, `` has to be negotiated by Panamanians.'' He said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, by remaining in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, would be able to `` wield his considerable influence'' because of the many Panamanians in the Defense Forces and in other key positions who are loyal to him. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, insisting on anonymity, acknowledged that the arrangement was `` less than ideal'' because it does not contemplate <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s short-term departure from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> has remained on as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, refusing to relinquish the embassy to a replacement envoy named by Panamanian President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> share the view that President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, deposed on Feb. 26 by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s supporters, continues to be the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON>, exiled publisher of the closed independent newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` This sounds like a surrender with cosmetics. This is the same mistake all over again _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervening in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, ignoring totally the political forces of the country.'' <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> representative of the Panamanian opposition umbrella group, the Civic Crusade, agreed. `` This cosmetic solution will only take the country down the road to disaster,'' said <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has no right to decide <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> can remain in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Mallol disputed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contentions that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will be out of power as soon as he is out of uniform. `` Obviously, this deal shows <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is making conditions. He will continue to interfere and continue the militarization of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mallol </PERSON> warned that the deal could backfire on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, causing a wave of anti-American sentiment among <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents. The administration has been seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster since he was indicted in early February on drug smuggling charges by two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has offered to give <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> political asylum and, as an inducement to him, the administration has said it would make no effort to extradite him if he accepted the Spanish bid. The administration has refused to recognize <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 2-month-old government and has frozen Panamanian government assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, among other measures. These steps have contributed to the collapse of the Panamanian economy.

<HEAD>New Persian Gulf Policy Will Put Pressure On Iran, Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is expanding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military role in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, saying it will not `` stand by and watch innocent people be killed or maimed'' in attacks on neutral ships. Under a policy announced Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces will go to the aid of non-communist, neutral ships that are fired on and ask for help. Previously, the umbrella of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protection had covered only American-flagged vessels and 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers that were allowed to register last summer as U.S.-flag vessels. The new policy, approved by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a White House meeting Friday, is aimed chiefly at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials blame for nearly all of the attacks on ships outside declared war-exclusion zones. However, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the policy should not be viewed as `` a tilt in either direction'' in the nearly eight-year war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s order came 11 days after American warships and aircraft clashed with Iranian forces in the gulf, sinking or disabling six Iranian vessels. The battles erupted following a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> attack on Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate. Describing the new policy, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said: `` We are not the policeman of the gulf, nor do we wish to be. `` For over 200 years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has been to help protect freedom of navigation in international waters. This -LRB- new -RRB- assistance is a logical and humanitarian outgrowth of recent events in the gulf which further strengthens our adherence to this principle. `` We can not stand by and watch innocent people be killed or maimed by malicious, lawless actions when we have the means to assist, and perhaps prevent them. We do not intend to describe our specific rules of engagement or the methods we plan to use in rendering this assistance.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the new policy will be provided to `` friendly, innocent neutral vessels flying a non-belligerent flag, outside declared war-exclusion zones, that are not carrying contraband or resisting legitimate visit and search by a <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> belligerent.'' An administration official said the policy will put `` a little more pressure'' on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept a cease-fire and withdrawal to pre-war borders. Most of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s attacks on ships have been in open, territorial waters that will be covered by the new policy, said the official, declining to be identified. By contrast, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s attacks have been confined largely to so-called exclusionary zones that are not covered. The official noted that the protective coverage does not apply to ships from communist countries, and emphasized that skippers must request aid before an American ship renders assistance. Currently, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has 17 ships in the gulf, including six mine-sweepers, and 10 others in nearby waters. The current protective effort costs $ 1 million a day. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said that he does not anticipate the new policy will require an increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, declared that two officers who were listed as missing after the fighting 11 days earlier were `` killed in action'' and disclosed that they had reported a hostile radar had locked on their helicopter gunship before it disappeared. In a statement, the corps refused to say the AH-1T Cobra gunship flown by Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, had definitely been shot down by Iranian forces, as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has claimed.

<TEXT>
 The House says the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ought to talk with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> about spending more for defense, but has rejected calls to bring <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops home if that is n't done. The decisions were part of the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to write a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 359-0 late Friday afternoon to approve a proposal calling for the administration to initiate talks with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> member nations about sharing the burden for defense. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote came as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> released its 1988 report on `` Allied Contributions to the Common Defense,'' an annual assessment mandated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The report was accompanied by a personal pledge from <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to `` press at every opportunity for progress'' in sharing the burdens of the alliance. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the report's `` principal conclusion'' is that the allies are making more of a contribution than they receive credit for, but he said `` there are substantial variations in performance among individual allies.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote echoed a similar proposal approved last summer by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but the administration has n't yet pushed hard for the talks. Both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members have criticized <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for failing to spend more on defense. They note that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends about 6.9 percent of its gross national product on defense, a far larger share than other western nations. Despite the criticism, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has refused for three years to order sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the alliance, a refusal that was continued Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 326,000 troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and 63,000 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. By a 240-120 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected a proposal by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, to bring 30,000 troops a year back from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and 7,000 troops a year from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> starting in 1991. Minutes later it voted 332-21 to reject a plan by Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., to withdraw 70,000 troops a year from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` Let's get smart and begin to tell our allies that we expect them to pay their fair share,'' <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. `` We are subsidizing their defense.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> made a similar appeal, telling his colleagues: `` The real purpose of this amendment is to demonstrate to our allies that we've had it. These people are stealing our jobs because we have been suckered into paying for their defense.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., said the issue should be `` considered in a clear process and not on an emotional basis. `` It is simply not possible to maintain the viability of a voluntary alliance of free countries if one of those countries tries to impose standards on the others,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. But Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., said, `` It's time Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> quit being taken for Uncle Sucker. The spending bill would authorize the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 299.5 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which is the same amount proposed by the separate bill that will be considered next month by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Differences between the bills eventually will be reconciled by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report said that the 6.1 percent of gross national product spent by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for defense in 1986 was the closest to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was third with 5.1 percent, followed by <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> at 4.8 percent and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at 3.9 percent. `` All of the remaining nations have shares of 3.2 percent or less,'' the study found. The report used 1986 data because that is the most recent year for which figures were available.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics panel says comments by Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> on an espionage case hurt relations between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and intelligence agencies, but <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> says the harm already had been done by the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> was chastised Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as it closed an investigation that began last year after the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Republican publicly discussed an espionage case involving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The committee told <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> in a letter: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has determined that your statements gave the appearance that you were disclosing sensitive national security information and such appearance jeopardized the mutual confidence which must exist between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the intelligence community. ... `` Because the committee has concluded that your actions were not intentional, deliberate, nor attended with gross negligence, and because of the particular facts of this case, we will not recommend that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> take institutional action against you. However, the committee wants to make it clear that it does not condone your actions.'' The ethics investigation centered on comments <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> made at an event sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on March 15, 1987. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> reportedly disclosed to the group that <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> in 1982 had `` changed the rules'' under which allies did not spy on each other by recruiting an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military officer to spy on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>'s comments were said to be aimed at giving context to the case of <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, an American convicted of spying on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said he based his remarks on newspaper accounts and maintained that he exercised `` due care'' in preparation for the speech. The former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying he was pleased that the committee had concluded its investigation and determined that no action was necessary. But he added: `` The late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s fundamental disagreement over the philosophy of congressional oversight led to frequent clashes with the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Director <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> was a strong leader, loyal to his own view of the public interest, but his belief that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should play little or no role in intelligence oversight led to a lack of mutual confidence long before March 1987.'' He added, `` I respectfully disagree with the ethic committee's conclusion that my statements gave the appearance that I was disclosing sensitive information. Sources present at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> meeting and who said they took careful notes reported that <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> recruited its Israeli spy after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1982 invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The spy passed along sensitive information about the invasion, <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> reportedly told the group. In a separate statement Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> `` was an excellent chairman during one of the most demanding and crucial periods for intelligence oversight I had just as much confidence in <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> before the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> examination as I do right now.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> wants employers to put warning tags on machinery that has been shut off to prevent injuries and deaths caused when the machines are turned on while being cleaned or serviced. Nine years and 1,000 deaths after unions first pleaded for action on one of the single biggest causes of industrial accidents, the agency issued proposed regulations Friday on so-called `` tagouts'' and `` lockouts.'' The proposals appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> a week after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the delay showed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` decision to let workers die while waiting on a standard. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> officials testified last week at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing chaired by <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> that the proposed regulations had been completed by the agency in early 1987 but had languished at the White House for nearly a year. About 7 percent of all occupational fatalities and 2 per cent of accident-caused injuries in the workplace occur now because such equipment is inadvertently restarted while someone is working on it. The agency estimated Friday that the so-called `` performance-oriented'' regulations will save 122 lives and prevent 60,000 job injuries a year. But they would require employers only to follow certain steps in turning off equipment and `` minimize'' the potential for inadvertently reactivating it. `` Very simple lockout, tagout measures, which taken only a few minutes, can prevent up to 10 percent of all the serious injuries in some major manufacturing industries,'' said Assistant Labor Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pendergrass </PERSON>. Agency officials estimated it will be a minimum of another year before the regulations are actually enacted. Unions had begun petitioning the agency for the regulations in 1979. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Molovich </PERSON>, a safety specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, predicted employers will ignore the guidelines and `` take the cheapest way out'' by using cardboard warning tags instead of locks to prevent a machine from being turned on. `` There will be no positive means of assuring that the equipment wo n't start,'' he said. The regulations, if adopted in current form, will apply to only 1.6 million employers and cover only 39 million workers, most of them in manufacturing. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the annual cost of compliance to businesses at $ 135 million. Exempted are millions of companies and workers in agriculture, oil and gas drilling, electric utilities, the maritime industry and construction. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> said protections for them will be included in other regulations to be proposed later. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scully </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> official who worked on the regulations for more than a decade, testified at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearings last week that the agency had first seen a need for them back in 1977. But <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> took no serious action until 1979, when the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, reacting to the deaths of 22 of its members in related accidents the previous five years, formally asked the government for emergency action. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> denied that request and similar pleas in 1982 and 1986 from other unions.

 Tens of thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> activists braved cold, damp weather to hear a message of support from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as they prayed for `` the sins of the nation'' and the scandal-plagued evangelical movement. `` It has been prayer which has strengthened this nation to weather storms both here and abroad,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the group Friday in a videotaped message. `` I am convinced that prayer has made it possible for me to continue in this office.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the dawn-to-dusk `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in'88'' rally attracted 150,000 people. Organizers emphasized the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of the crowd. They said they hoped the gathering would show all Americans that Christians remain as ardent and unified as ever, despite the well-publicized downfall of television evangelists <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` The world thought the scandals of the last year brought the church to its knees,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbyterian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> said. `` The church will arise from its knees, cleaner and purer and stronger.'' The gathering was meant to be non-political, which was why organizers said Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was not invited. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was one of the main speakers at a similar rally in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> eight years ago. In fact, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was the only national political figure to speak to the crowd. `` Today, American society must face serious problems, from within and without, which threaten to steal our liberties and destroy our freedoms,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Abortion, child abuse, pornography and drug addiction eat away at our most precious national resource _ our children. `` Yet we do not falter in the face of such evil for there is a wind of prayer blowing throughout our land.'' Earlier, evangelist <PERSON> Oral </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, made a brief speech recalling how `` a man of God'' laid hands on him and cured him of tuberculosis when he was 17. `` I stand here today, 53 years later with my lungs sound and whole, my body healed by the power of God,'' he said as members of the audience applauded. One of the first speakers of the day was the Rev. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Derstine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who urged `` Christians to offer prayers of `` repentance for the sins of the naion.'' `` I am talking about drug addiction, alcoholism and suicides. We feel prayer in the schools is still an important issue and we believe abortion still is an issue,'' <PERSON> Derstine </PERSON> said. Such sentiments were echoed in the banners and signs carried by rally participants. One banner said, `` Take drugs out of our schools and put God back in.'' Another sign said, `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> forgives sinning, let him.'' One of the rally-goers, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldbloom </PERSON>, assistant pastor of Full Gospel Tabernacle in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he thought it significant that the rally was being held in the nation's capital. `` I believe a public display of prayer and repentence will let <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> know and the country know that people still love God,'' he said.

 An indicted <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> mobster says <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nostra </LOCATION> families use murder to enforce their internal rules, but insists, `` We do n't kill innocent people.'' <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> `` The Fish'' <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON>, who was a `` soldier'' in the Genovese organized crime family, told senators Friday the organization was `` very disciplined'' and members paid a high price for breaking the rules. `` Killings were mandatory'' for fooling around with another member's wife and dealing in drugs, he said. `` When it comes to an amico nostra's wife or ` junk' there was no talk,'' <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said. An amico nostra is a member of a mob family, and `` junk'' means narcotics. <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said mob members also could get murdered for `` ratting, refusing to go on a ` hit' if asked or knowingly killing a cop or other law enforcement agent.'' To win approval to carry out a murder, <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said, mob members had to go through the chain of command, right up to the boss of the family. But he insisted, `` We do n't kill innocent people.'' Unlike witnesses who spoke from behind a screen, <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> _ a thin, balding man with glasses _ testified in full public view before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> on Investigations. He currently is in custody while awaiting trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on racketeering, extortion and conspiracy charges. After his arrest in 1986, he cooperated with federal authorities and even carried a concealed microphone while talking to other mobsters. But <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said personal safety concerns have persuaded him to end the effort, and he was heavily guarded in the hearing room. `` I'm fair game, no question about it,'' he said. <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said he had worked for the mob since 1958, as an associate of `` Fat Tony'' <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, a major figure in the Genovese family. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON>, who <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said was `` like a father to me,'' is now on trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on charges related to mob activities. <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> also told the committee, headed by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., that four organized crime families run the high-rise construction industry in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> through control over the concrete industry and construction unions He said bids were rigged, and that contractors and unions winning construction jobs had to kick back 2 percent of the contract price to the mob. <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said the system was arranged through the `` ` 2 <ORGANIZATION> Percent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' an organization run by the Genovese, <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON>, Lucchese and <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> families. He estimated that at least 50 percent of the high-rise construction in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had a mob connection and added, `` Legitimate guys ai n't got a chance'' to win contracts for those buildings. <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said each of the four mob families had an expert on the construction business in the organization. Members read the Dodge Reports, a construction trade publication that lists upcoming jobs, he said. `` The club members split up all of the jobs over $ 2 million,'' he said. But if the contract went over $ 5 million, it went to a mob-run company, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; A Concrete, he said. When the smaller contractors complained of the arrangement, he said, they won the right to split all jobs over $ 3 million. As a mob soldier who turned down promotions because he did n't want the added responsibility, <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said he preferred to run the numbers business in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> `` I had some bad years, but in a good year I could make as much as $ 2 million or more,'' he said. When <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> asked if he kept the money, <PERSON> Cafaro </PERSON> said: `` I spent it. I gave it away. I loaned a lot of money to people and never got it back.'' The mobster said he only carried cash.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Unchanged From March To April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A preliminary report for April shows that prices farmers got for raw products were unchanged, on average, for the second month in a row but were still 4 percent above a year ago. But the report Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also said that farm production expenses have crept higher in recent months. `` Prices were higher for soybeans, cattle, hay and oranges, and lower for lettuce, eggs, milk and strawberries,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet expenses were up 1.8 percent from January and averaged 3.7 percent more than in April 1987. `` Higher prices for feeder pigs, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals, tractors and other machinery contributed most to the increase from January,'' the report said. Department economists say net cash income of farmers set a record in 1987 of about $ 57 billion. This year's net _ the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the range of $ 50 billion to $ 55 billion. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this year, compared with a 4.1 percent average increase in 1987. According to the preliminary April figures, based mostly on mid-month averages, the index for livestock and livestock products was unchanged from March but was up 0.7 percent from a year ago. `` Higher prices for cattle, calves and broilers were offset by lower prices for eggs, milk and hogs,'' the report said. Crop prices overall were up 0.9 percent from March and averaged 9.9 percent more than a year ago. The price index for oil-bearing crops, which consist mainly of soybeans, was up 3.3 percent from March and averaged 22 percent more than in April 1987. Soybeans prices, at $ 6.36 per bushel, were up 30 cents during the month. Prices paid to commercial vegetable growers, overall, dropped 4.4 percent from March and also were down 4.4 percent from a year ago. The prices of most individual vegetables rose from March to April, but those increases were more than offset by a sharp drop for lettuce and a seasonal decline in asparagus prices. April farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures, the same as in March and February. A year ago the April index was 125 percent. The quarterly parity ratio was reported at 51 percent in April, down two percentage points from the revised January reading of 53 percent. The revised parity ratio for April 1987 also was 51 percent. Although many economists say the old parity standard is outmoded because it does n't take into full account changes in farm productivity, others contend the ratio is useful in comparing year-to-year changes. Under the parity formula, prices farmers get for commodities are compared with prices they pay to meet expenses. It then uses a 1910-14 measurement to express what happened. At 100 percent, the indicator would theoretically mean farmers had the same buying power as they had in 1910-14. For example, the average price of wheat in April was $ 2.81 per bushel, according to the preliminary figures. That was 40 percent of the parity price of $ 7.07 per bushel. The report also said: _ Cattle averaged $ 68.90 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 68.30 in March and above the $ 62.60 reported for April 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 41.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 42.20 in March and $ 50.80 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 1.85 a bushel, was down from $ 1.86 in March, but was up from the average of $ 1.52 a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 2.81 per bushel, compared with $ 2.74 in March and $ 2.63 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 8.41 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 8.79 in March and $ 3.63 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 6.36 per bushel, compared with $ 6.06 in March and $ 4.90 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 57.3 cents per pound, compared with 57.7 in March and 50.4 cents in April 1987 _ Eggs were 45.5 cents per dozen, compared with 50.8 cents in March and 54.8 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 11.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 11.90 in March and $ 12.20 a year earlier _ Broilers were 28 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 27.5 cents in March and 29.2 cents a year ago

 The senior prom returned to <ORGANIZATION> Forrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, more than 25 years after it was banned by school officials. `` I'm gon na do Da Bump,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an 18-year-old senior, said as he made his appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> Forrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> dressed all in white but for a black snap-brim hat and black cane. The last prom was in 1962, said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who helped plan the last one as a senior class sponsor early in his career. He said he did n't know what had prompted the ban _ `` I was just a teacher at the time'' _ noting that it would n't have been a racial issue because the first black student did n't enter the school until 1965. `` That was before integration. After that, the board voted not to have them any more,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. However, the student council officers decided not to have a king and queen for the new prom partly because the couple might be racially mixed, the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The newspaper's assertion was disputed by <PERSON> Kaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 17, recording secretary for the council. `` We decided not to have a prom king and queen because we feel that we're all kings and queens,'' she said. `` We talked about it and said, ` No, we do n't want to do that.' More than half the 355 seniors were expected to attend the dance in the <ORGANIZATION> Forrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, Student Council President <PERSON> Tangella </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Assistant Principal <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON> said he expected the crowd to be about evenly divided between black and white students, like the composition of the 1,450-student school. `` I do n't think that's even been thought about,'' Bridges said. The town of about 14,000, 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, is about evenly divided between black and white. The boys wore black, white or gray but the colors of the girls' gowns ranged across the spectrum and skirt lengths were anywhere between the ankles and the knees Three couples stepped out of a stretch limouisine from a funeral home, the driver holding the door. Then, at the request of a TV crew, they got back in and did it again. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, 18, sharply dressed in an Army Junior ROTC uniform, came all the way from <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION>, 125 miles to the west, to escort his cousin, <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 18. Precautions were taken to avoid any problems at the prom, Bridges said. `` There'll be strictly no drinking,'' he said. `` We do n't allow smoking anyway, at the school, so there'll be no smoking at the prom, no drinking, no drugs.'' Students who leave the prom will not be able to return, he said. `` And there wo n't be any press or anything like that,'' Bridges said. `` It's going to be strictly for the kids.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Forrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> voted last fall to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to sponsor a prom for 1988's graduating seniors. `` We just thought it was time for us to do like other folks,'' school board member <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said after that meeting. `` It's a milestone,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, a 1967 graduate of the school. `` People in <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> are pulling together to project a positive image.'' No dances have been sponsored by the school since 1962, not even informal hops in the gym, Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said this week. `` They've had them, but they were provided by different fraternities or different sororities,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 17, who is black. `` But as for those provided by the school, this will be the first.'' The private dances, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said, have been strictly black or white affairs, none of them integrated. The theme chosen for the prom was `` A Night on the Town,'' said Bridges. `` They've got skyscrapers and all that,'' he said. `` It'll look pretty good.''

 Health Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, in a move acknowledged by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to be `` a little unusual,'' is taking public issue with the assertion that the administration is winning the war on drugs. `` Generally speaking, Mr. President, I prefer optimism to pessimism, as you do,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and three <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> colleagues at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` But today, I do n't know how I can honestly be very optimistic about the war on drugs.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s leadership has resulted in `` major gains.'' `` We're winning some battles,'' he said, `` but it's difficult for me to say we're winning the war, especially when we consider drug dealing and use in our streets and our homes.'' A text of <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>'s remarks at the private <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting on Thursday was made public Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged afterward that it was `` a little unusual'' for a Cabinet officer to go public with remarks delivered to the president in a private meeting. But he sought to soft-pedal any differences between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>. `` That's the same thing the president said _ we've made progress but obviously we need to do more,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` I do n't know what he's up to,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>'s action `` On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with it.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> often has been upbeat about the war on drugs. `` With all the headlines about how we're losing the drug war, let's keep in mind the progress we've made,'' he told a White House Conference for a <LOCATION> Drug-Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Feb. 29, adding, `` We've strengthened the laws'' and `` drug seizures are at an all-time high.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> backed the administration's call for tougher law enforcement in his Thursday presentation, but he also called for more attention to effective treatment and strong federal leadership to establish additional treatment clinics. And he made clear there was a pragmatic political component to his appeal. `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, there are political dangers as well,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> chief. In a clear refererence to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said, `` One of the two remaining Democrat candidates for president is getting some of his highest marks for his passionate and creative oratory on the drug epidemic and is poised to steal from our party what has been a traditional Republican issue _ law enforcement.'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> supported aggressive law enforcement and other approaches such as first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Just Say No'' campaign, but he said `` some'' are using the first lady's campaign `` as a political football, saying it's an empty slogan, however unfair that characterization might be.'' He went on: `` I believe as we approach the end of this second term, we need to take a fresh look at what we're doing to secure a lasting end to the demand for illicit drugs.'' He called for more research to improve the efficiency of treatment strategies and expanded treatment facilities. `` On the topic of treatment,'' <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> said, `` we also need to talk turkey with big-city mayors, councils, and suburban jurisdictions as well, who often knuckle under to pressure from those who are, quote-unquote, ` all for treatment, as long as it's not in my backyard. `` Communities and neighborhoods need to be willing to accept treatment facilities,'' he said. `` In some instances, -LRB- federal -RRB- funding is available, it's just not being used.'' Among those at the Thursday meeting were Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON>.

 The gunmen who hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet for 15 days remain in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, where the ordeal ended last week after a <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> promise to give `` early release'' to a handful of Shiite Moslem prisoners, according to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> account. On Thursday, Algerian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON> said the hijackers had left <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> without getting what they wanted and without obtaining any concessions for freeing the 31 remaining passengers. But two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday the hijackers had been promised that five or six of the 17 prisoners held in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for bomb attacks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies in 1983 would be released early. However, the prisoners have not been released and the gunmen, who had been promised safe passage, remain in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, the officials said on condition of anonymity. According to this account of the negotiations, Algerian intermediaries faithfully conveyed <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s promise to the hijackers. But the officials said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, which has a firm policy of not yielding to terrorism, may not have had any intention of letting the prisoners go in the first place. `` They have stood so fast for so long, they probably had no intention of letting them go early,'' one of the officials said. The five-year prison terms of three of the 17 Shiite Moslems are due to expire at the end of the year. During the long ordeal, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> repeatedly urged <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> publicly and privately not to yield to the hijackers. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was not aware of the terms to end the siege because they were worked out through Algerian intermediaries, the officials said. The account was provided by <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, which has played a role in resolving several hijackings, in diplomatic contacts with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the aftermath of the hijacking. <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON> also said that while his government would have liked to apprehend the hijackers, such a move would have damaged its credibility as a mediator in international crises such as attempts to obtain the release of the eight American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sahnoun </PERSON>, addressing reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> here, said the hijackers `` went back without achieving anything.'' The Kuwaiti press agency also said on April 20 that the hijackers _ there were believed to be eight or nine _ had probably been flown to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the gunmen had remained in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, interviewed separately, said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had assured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that despite reports to the contrary, the hijackers had not been flown from <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. Reports from <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> had said the terrorists were flown to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, from where they made their way by land to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has identified one of the hijackers as <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Izz-al-Din </PERSON> and said he might have been involved in the killing of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> in the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in 1985. He was charged by a federal grand jury in seizing the plane. This raises a possibility of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for extradition. Also, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has said one of the passengers may have had dual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. He condemned the hijackers last week as murderers. The plane, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 with 112 passengers and crew members, was hijacked April 5 on a flight from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and spent several days in Meshed, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, before flying to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Two Kuwaiti passengers were killed and their bodies dumped from the plane while it was in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The hijackers' principal demand was the release of the 17 prisoners in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The freed hostages included three members of the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family.

 The <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> prime minister has a message for Americans who think <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is a sleepy, dusty country crippled by years of dictatorship. <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who was elected in 1982, is in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> making what amounts to an announcement that his country should no longer be considered the <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> wants some respect. `` We'd like to change the nature of relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said Friday, speaking through an interpreter in his hotel room. `` Above all, we want <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to be accepted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as we are now. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is going to be economically sound by the end of the century.'' The year 1992, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said, marks <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s `` awakening'' from <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s 36-year rule that ended with <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s death in 1975. In four years, the Summer Olympics will be held in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, a World's Fair will take place in <LOCATION> Seville </LOCATION> and the 500th anniversary of <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON>' voyage will be celebrated in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The year 1992 also marks the completion of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s integration into the European Economic Community. `` Over the last 10 years that have gone by, the economy has begun producing rapidly,'' said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for over half a century had a hyper-protectionist economy but now that it's opened up we've seen rapid development and economic growth. This is what we want to communicate to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' On Thursday, speaking at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was part of a growing political and economic union in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that could lead to a stronger <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. However, the 46-year-old prime minister said it will take time for <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to recover from <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>'s regime. At present, the per capita income in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is less than half of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s, he said.

 A judge Friday allowed <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to bar students who owe more than $ 300 in overdue fees from taking final exams, a school spokesman said. Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> dissolved the restraining order he had issued Wednesday against enforcement of the policy, said <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Students who owe more than $ 300 on Monday _ when final exams begin _ will not be allowed to take their tests, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. University officials testified Friday that 600 students owed more than $ 300 in fees, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pintard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The judge ordered Tuskegee to open its business office all day Saturday and part of Sunday so students could make payments on overdue fees, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The university announced earlier that abuse of an installment plan had prompted it to enforce its policy barring students with overdue fees from attending class or taking exams. Officials estimated 2,000 students owe almost $ 1.5 million. The crackdown had sparked a week of protests, including a sit-in at the administration building last weekend. Student leaders said the university should have warned students earlier about the crackdown and should have allowed students in financial difficulty to work out a timetable for repayment. <PERSON> Pintard </PERSON> calling the judge's ruling Friday a `` serious miscarriage of justice.'' University President <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said the ruling `` underscores the fact that when students make loans they have to pay them.'' `` What everybody needs to be clear about, however, is this is not a case of <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fighting its students,'' <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said. `` It's a case of <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> insisting that students learn very important lessons for life.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed at a record high Saturday for the second consecutive trading day. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 242.15 points Thursday, added another 75.42 points, or 0.16 percent, to finish Saturday's half-day session at 27,509.54. `` The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market has been in good, stable condition without any bad news to prompt selling,'' said a stock analyst for a major brokerage, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Japanese yen's stability on foreign exchange markets also has helped boost stock prices, he said. Trading was a relatively quiet 450 million shares on the market's first section Saturday because of the holiday-studded `` Golden Week'' which started Friday, traders said. During Thursday's full-day session, 800 million shares were traded. Popular issues included electricals, machineries and chemicals. Foodstuffs, textiles and real estates also gained ground, while some drugs and banks declined. Most major Japanese financial institutions will be closed Wednesday through Friday because of holidays.

 The first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor conceived in captivity hatched Friday, its keepers using tweezers and their fingertips to help the newest member of the nearly extinct species break free from its shell, officials said. `` It's alive and it looks healthy,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's resting now. We do n't have any other details.'' The hatching represents a tremendous boost to efforts to save the species. It brings the known population of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land bird to 28, all in captivity _ 15 at the park here and 13 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo The squawking infant, named <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON>, an Indian word for `` condor,'' was swaddled in a towel and placed in the same type of incubator used for premature infants. `` Early this morning there were 27 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors left in the world,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Toone </PERSON>, curator of birds at the park. `` This afternoon there's 28 of them, and we could n't be more excited about that. `` When the numbers are so low, one bird is seen as a very big step away from extinction,'' <PERSON> Toone </PERSON> added. Although the tiny bird was not brought forth to `` meet the press,'' its history-making birth was recorded on videotape and shown at a press conference Friday night. Earlier, the chick had become stuck in dried membrane and albumen and could no longer rotate in the shell to peck its way out. Its keepers removed it cautiously because of the danger of rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes. A recording of vultures making hissing and grunting sounds was played at intervals to duplicate the sounds the chick would hear in a natural setting. Park officials had said they intended to intervene by Saturday if the chick, which began hatching Wednesday, had n't emerged from the shell. Allowing the hatching struggle to continue would overexhaust the bird. The chick, conceived by the only known activing breeding pair of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor, was expected to weigh about 9 ounces, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. The species has a wingspan of up to 10 feet at maturity. The 10-ounce blue-green egg, about 5 inches long, had been under a 24-hour watch since Wednesday, when keepers noticed `` pip'' cracks in one end signaling the start of hatching, which can take three days. After the egg was laid March 3, it was taken away from the parent birds and incubated artificially in hopes that the female bird would produce a second egg. So far, this has not happened. It will be a while before the sex of the bird can be determined through a blood test, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said that representatives of the Chumash Indian tribe had been enlisted to select the name for the chick upon hatching. The tribe inhabited the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> area that most recently served as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor habitat, and the bird figures prominently in the tribe's religion.

Stark is the head of <ORGANIZATION> Rastar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, which produced the film. In an April 20 letter to <PERSON> Siskel </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, Stark recounts several positive reviews of `` Biloxi Blues'' that appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. But `` there on television was <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON> saying ` I realized to my shock that his -LRB- <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> -RRB- career has gone nowhere in recent years. ... What has happened to him as a director? ...

I was very shocked at how dull the film was,''' Stark wrote to <PERSON> Siskel </PERSON>. `` For such men of the world, the two of you shock very easily,'' said Stark in the three-page letter, listing a number of problems such as <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> tensions, AIDS, and homelessness. The letter was sent to the heads of several major studios. In a letter obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Siskel </PERSON> replied to Stark and referred to an earlier, apparently friendlier, letter. `` I think you should know that someone using your name and good stationery has just violated the reasonable opinions of the earlier letter you sent me,'' <PERSON> Siskel </PERSON> wrote. `` I suggest that you have someone stand guard at your desk to make sure that no crackpot gets ahold of your letterhead.''

 Workers glared with icy determination at platoons of plainclothes police as they streamed out through the gates of the huge strike-bound <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> steelworks during a shift change. Striding toward a bus stop, a few flashed the V-for-victory sign once out of sight of police. Their strike at the plant in the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> has shaken the government at the highest level. At the bus stop 100 yards from the gates, a knot of workers began to talk freely with foreign reporters. `` They have to give people what they deserve,'' A beefy man in a shiny tan jacket said of communist authorities. He punched the air angrily with his finger as he spoke: `` We are working. Prices are going up. We have no money.'' Others murmured agreement and nodded. It was Friday night and workers had occuped the plant for four days, demanding pay raises, the restoration of union rights and reinstatement of dismissed Solidarity activists. A worker on the edge of the group said he made $ 107 a month, half of which he must spend on the maintenance and mortgage on his home: `` We are working all the time, on Sundays too. And we can hardly live.'' Prices have gone up 42 percent so far this year as the result of government reforms aimed at making the economy more market-oriented. `` We do n't believe them anymore,'' a middle-aged man with a quiet manner said of authorities. `` They keep promising -LRB- that things will get better -RRB- and yet we ca n't earn in one day even enough for two kilos -LRB- 4 pounds -RRB- of herring. `` They share millions and we are near starvation.'' The workers have been inside the plant for 16 hours at a stretch during the strike, the nation's worst since martial law stifled the Solidarity independent labor federation 6 -LCB- yearss ago. Strikers spend their day at the plant sitting, talking, tinkering, but not working. They said some workers have not joined the stoppage and toil while their colleagues in a neighboring department sit idle. The strike committee says it represents half the plant's 32,000 workers, and from 12,000 to 14,000 workers are in the plant at any one time.

<TEXT>
 As spring returns to this rugged country, plants, bushes and trees that have evolved to live with fire are sprouting among ruined woodlands charred by <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s worst forest fire in 50 years. One of the patches of color dotting the shiny blacks and dull browns of burned trees in the <LOCATION> Kalmiopsis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION> is the pink flower of the <LOCATION> Kalmiopsis </LOCATION> bush, which needs periodic fires to survive. `` It lives in some pretty rough places,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe what happens is it lives where the fire does n't hit. You expect fire to burn places it's been before. `` It grows in the harshest sites because it ca n't compete. As things go on and sites become better, it loses ground to other plants. When the fire comes through and it is growing in these little sanctuaries, it has a competitive edge.'' He and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Atzet </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regional ecologist, scrambled down a steep slope of crumbling rock recently to a dead canyon of live oak marked with white flags. The clump of <LOCATION> Kalmiopsis </LOCATION> that survived was sheltered by the seared leaves of the oak trees. In other parts of the wilderness, the forest is healing itself as loggers and environmentalists fight over whether to salvage the 96,500 acres of burned timber and replant the land or leave the job to Mother Nature. <PERSON> Atzet </PERSON> stopped to dig out a fawn lilly, also known as a trout lilly, blooming where just months before fire seared the soil's surface `` The lillies are just loving it,'' <PERSON> Atzet </PERSON> said. `` They store all their energy underground in this bulb. Whether there is a fire or not during the summer, it does n't care. `` We are finding that leachates from the ash left by the fire stimulate these things to grow. That gives them a competitive advantage -LRB- against plants knocked back by the fire -RRB-. It's a war out here for every bit of nitrogen and every bit of water.'' <PERSON> Madrone </PERSON> and sugar pine on one slope had been killed by a fast-moving wall of flame that roared down <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. But now many of the plants show tiny green sprouts around the bases of their trunks. Throughout the North Kalmiopsis Roadless Area of the <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, these evergreen hardwoods valued as clean-burning firewood are grouped in rings, evidence that fire has been a frequent visitor. Each time the sprouts return after a fire, the ring grows wider. Where the fire overran the remains of a cleared area near <LOCATION> Chinaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hat </LOCATION>, new <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir seedlings already have been planted for a new forest. <PERSON> Atzet </PERSON> stopped again to drill into the bulging `` cat face'' of a sugar pine. The cat face is a ring of bulging bark that has grown to heal a scar left by a previous fire. Because the healing bark is loaded with pitch, it tends to burn more intensely each time fire sweeps past, and the cat face grows. `` I've found trees here that are 200 years old that have burned four or five times,'' <PERSON> Atzet </PERSON> said. By examining the older trees, <PERSON> Atzet </PERSON> has found that fire returns to the Kalmiopsis an average of every 50 years. `` It could be 150 years or it could be 25, but the average is 50,'' said <PERSON> Atzet </PERSON>. `` If we look at our records, we find that there was a fire in the <LOCATION> Kalmiopsis </LOCATION> area in the 1930s, so this one was right on schedule.'' He bored into a sugar pine that was blackened around the base but retained a green canopy. He pulled out a core of damp wood and examined the largely undamaged cambium layer beneath the bark, which allows a tree to form new bark and wood. `` What fire?'' he exclaimed.

With more than 1,250 delegates in the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> total, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> enjoys a lead of roughly 400 over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is insisting `` it's not all over'' and urging <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> supporters to ignore polls and other signs that he is advancing strongly toward the Democratic presidential nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, expecting to add to his string of victories in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> primaries on Tuesday, all but ignored his remaining party rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> while campaigning across <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Friday. Instead, he focused on criticizing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on trade legislation and other issues. He was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> before traveling to next-door <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where he planned events in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. At every stop as he criss-crossed <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told crowds, `` I hope you wo n't pay attention to these polls.'' He recalled his 1978 race for re-election as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> when he lost despite a huge lead, as much as 50 points at one point in the polls. `` What I am concerned about,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` ... is people looking at polls and taking them seriously and assuming that it's all over `` It's not all over, and I know that better than anybody from rather painful personal experience.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who holds a commanding lead in the delegate race and is the undisputed front-runner, has come under sharpened criticism from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> over the past two days. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned aside questions about his rival's charge that he would only `` manage'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s ecomomic program, not change it. `` I just do n't talk about those things,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I have a record. The White House would be very much surprised if they learned all of a sudden <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was going to manage Reaganomics _ they do n't believe that for one minute.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is seeking to make a major issue in industrial <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> of the president's vow to veto the trade bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because of the provision requiring companies to give 60 days notice before closing plants. He said a similar law in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> had `` cushioned the blow'' and `` helped us to save thousands of jobs and hundreds of companies.'' However, because the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law requests _ but does not require _ companies to provide workers with 90 days warning before a plant closing, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration officials in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> have been unable to offer evidence the notification provision has accomplished its goal. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state officials say the plant closing law has not `` saved'' workers' jobs but has helped some 24,000 find new employment after plant closings. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> appeared with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> before a union audience in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, but did not endorse him and planned to appear with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said he wanted `` to ensure an open, enthusiastic primary in the state, in which Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> knows he's as welcome as Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at every place, including the governor's office, and his supporters know we expect them to be part of a unified effort in the fall.'' Despite his insistence the race is not over, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> struck an optimistic note as he urged a lunchtime crowd in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> to help bring a large voter turnout. `` If we do, we're going to win in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, we're going to win in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, we're going to win in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and win this nomination,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rebels Drop Demand; 11 Arrested In Demonstrations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rebel leaders dropped a demand that their fighters receive ammunition and weapons after moving into cease-fire zones, removing a major obstacle in peace talks with the government. Also Friday, the leftist Sandinista government's labor troubles persisted and police used rubber truncheons to quell protests by striking auto mechanics and construction workers, arresting 11 demonstrators. The decision by leaders of the rebels, known as Contras, not to demand arms supplies after their fighters move into the seven cease-fire zones removed a key barrier to achieving a lasting peace under accords signed March 23. `` We have desisted from receiving replacements of weapons and ammunition in the zones and we accept the concept of sovereignty and indivisibility of national territory,'' top <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> told a news conference. The Contras had also insisted that the cease-fire zones be autonomous. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said, however, that the Contras rejected the government's demand that more than $ 17 million in humanitarian aid to the rebels, recently approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, be channeled through the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> The aid was to be funneled to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Under the March 23 agreement signed in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, only neutral parties may distribute the aid. The rebels have been supported by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since 1981, when they mounted the insurgency that has claimed more than 26,000 lives. The Sapoa accords promise them a role in the political process in a more democratic <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Earlier Friday, the rebels turned down a government proposal to extend by a month a 60-day cease-fire that began April 1. They said the Sandinista offer showed `` a lack of good will to fulfill the agreements.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Friday he would continue to apply economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to counter the `` unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' posed by the Sandinista regime. In a semi-annual report required by law, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said trade sanctions `` complement the diplomatic and other aspects of our policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' One of the two labor protests in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Friday came outside the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for anti-Sandinista unions, where 38 construction workers and auto mechanics went on a hunger strike Sunday. On Friday night, about 80 university students staged a march in sympathy with about 1,500 workers from both industries who have been on strike for higher wages since Feb. 25. The students passed near the union headquarters, chanting `` A Free Fatherland!.'' Riot squads standing by did not interfere, but the police cordoned off the building's entrance. A banner strung across the building said: `` We prefer to die of hunger fighting with dignity than to die working as slaves.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Osejo </PERSON>, an opposition leader and director of privately-owned <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, claimed Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> summoned him to his office, berated the radio for its reporting of the demonstrations and punched him in the mouth. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, a leader of a private human rights group and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> later apologized.

 Officials of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will meet for the first time to discuss a peace settlement that will include the possible withdrawal of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> when they join delegates from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> next week. The delegations also will confer on other regional issues, including the status of a parallel effort to bring about independence and black majority rule in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which is under South African administration, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation to the May 3-4 talks will be headed by Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. Cuban officials will join the talks as part of the Angolan delegation. South African and Angolan forces have been intermittently involved militarily since the Marxist government assumed power in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION> in 1975. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> sent troops into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> last summer in support of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s U.S.-backed rebel movement. South African officials have said the number of troops has been sharply reduced from a peak of 3,000. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has given high priority to reaching an agreement that would lead to the withdrawal of the estimated 40,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, a close ally of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were encouraged last January when <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed for the first time to the principle of a total Cuban withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. There has been no agreement, however, on a timetable. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s main interests are an end to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assistance to the rebel movement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and to the withdrawal of South African forces in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. A delegation from the Organization of African Unity met with <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> two weeks ago and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should end all aid to the Angolan rebels as a means of helping the peace process but officials said <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> turned down the request.

He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lacks understanding about southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, particlarly in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is to the right of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also vowed Friday to intensify his quest for the nomination after a string of primary losses to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He told a labor rally in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>: `` I'm not behind. I'm so far in front of where I started. We've come too far from where we started and I do n't feel no way tired. We're going all the way.'' It was clear <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s strategy is to paint sharp distinctions between himself and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, criticizing his rival as lacking in clear policy positions. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would not give military aid to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> in the face of <LOCATION> South-Africa </LOCATION> backed rebel brutality against civilians. That is someting even <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> favors, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters traveling on his campaign bus that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does not understand the policy options in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but that he was not questioning the governor's motivation. `` His intention I'm convinced would be to end apartheid,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` But we need a plan and a commitment to end apartheid ...

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a rowdy and contentious convention, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chose wealthy businessman <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> as its candidate in next year's presidential elections. The choice Friday set off a controversy that could split the party. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister, was chosen by acclamation as the sole entry in the convention marked by insults, boos, whistles and catcalls. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, his bitter rival and a former foreign minister, boycotted the convention and so did President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. The president, the party's honorary chairman, had urged both contenders to step aside in favor of a `` unity candidate.'' The two rivals, as well as the convention, ignored a dramatic appeal earlier in the week to put aside their differences and back <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a party veteran, in order to maintain unity within the centrist organization. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> warned that a rift in <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> ranks will weaken the party and leave the field wide open to its chief rival, the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which has already won control of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and a majority of mayorships in mid-term elections March 20. By law, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> could not run for a second five-year term. He won the presidency in the midst of a leftist civil war against the U.S.-supported conservative government that began in 1980 and continues. Months ago, <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> wrested control of the party machinery from the <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> factions, so <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> was at big disadvantage throughout the race. <PERSON> Aquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a nephew of the president and member of the party's 10-member directorate, predicted the choice `` is going to shatter'' the party. Also addressing the delegates before the acclamation vote, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Vieira </PERSON>, another directorate member, warned amid boos: `` If we make this decision and the party splits, the people will not have a democratic option in the presidential election.'' Rey Prendes expressed hope there will be no split. `` I'm sure that once tempers cool, we'll all be together again in the struggle. Let the anger end today,'' he said in an acceptance speech. `` My arms are open. There is no need to exclude anyone,'' he said in what was taken as a reference to <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> is a former presidential press spokesman, a Cabinet-level job, a former mayor of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and a member of the directorate. He and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> helped found the party in 1960.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says that if the Democrats want to talk about sleaze, he is prepared to `` have some fun'' with corruption in their own backyards. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was campaigning today in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, planning stops in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and at an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> spring football scrimmage. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has already amassed enough delegates to capture the Republican nomination, spent Friday in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, which, like <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, holds its primary Tuesday. Before more than 4,000 supporters who packed the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> Friday evening, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to `` bring new people to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ... people who come there to serve and not to profit.'' But in interviews with <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is not worried about his campaign being hurt by current investigations into Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s business associates. `` I hear -LRB- the Democrats -RRB- talking about it. But there is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a guilt-by-association mode where we can find in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politics or campaign staff or things of that nature,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a thinly veiled reference to Democratic presidential front-runner <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I hope we do n't have to do it,'' he said. Asked by television reporters if the `` sleaze'' issue hurts him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't think so. I do n't think anyone has ever accused me of any conflict of interest. I think the Democrats are trying to make it that.'' But depending on whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wins the Democratic nomination, `` We will have some fun, too, trying to look into what is going on in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He added, `` We've got some cannon fodder, if you want to get into that. At the big convention center rally <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also responded to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticism of his backing a threatened veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of the trade bill passed this week in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not talking about pink slips. We're not talking about closing factories. We're talking about opening factories until every man and woman that wants a job has a job.'' `` It's going to be the classic confrontation between one who respects the federalist approach and one who wants to see a return to the misery days,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, clearly spoiling for the general election fight during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` I did n't like the primary part. I did n't like going out nitpicking, trying to find minutiae differences with my fellow Republicans,'' he added. At a fund-raising breakfast in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> waffled on whether to support President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s retaliatory strike against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and he accused both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of being soft on penalties for drug-pushers. `` Let me throw this challenge down'' to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I favor the death penalty for narcotics kingpins. Now will the Democrats join us on that or not?'' He defended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admistration efforts to cut off the supply of drugs, but told reporters, `` I'm taking a look now at changing the whole structure of how the government is set up'' to wage the drug fight. Asked why President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not yet endorsed him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm sure he has in his mind as long as there is any vestige of the primary, I expect he wo n't. ... I think he will give me full, unqualified support at the appropriate time.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has a major rally scheduled in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for Tuesday, and there have been reports <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may announce his support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said Friday that was not yet certain.

 Here is the text of the statement released Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announcing a change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy regarding the protection of commercial ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` The president has decided to provide assistance under certain circumstances to ships in distress in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> in keeping with longstanding, time-honored <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and maritime tradition. `` Such aid will be provided to friendly, innocent neutral vessels flying a non-belligerent flag, outside declared war-exclusion zones, that are not carrying contraband or resisting legitimate visit and search by a <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> belligerent. `` Following a request from the vessel under attack, assistance will be rendered by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship or aircraft if this unit is in the vicinity and its mission permits rendering such assistance. With this assistance, we anticipate no increase in our current force levels. `` We are not the policemen of the gulf, nor do we wish to be. `` For over 200 years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy has been to help protect freedom of navigation in international waters. This -LRB- new -RRB- assistance is a logical and humanitarian outgrowth of recent events in the gulf which further strengthens our adherence to this principle. `` We can not stand by and watch innocent people be killed or maimed by malicious, lawless actions when we have the means to assist, and perhaps prevent them. `` We do not intend to describe our specific rules of engagement or the methods we plan to use in rendering this assistance. We see no reason to give advantage to those who wish us ill. `` With regard to mines, I have consulted with our allies who were attending the Nuclear Planning Group meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> this week We all agreed that we should provide each other mutual support and cooperation in the interest of keeping the international waterways free from this threat. `` Finally, this policy should not be construed as a tilt in either direction in the war. `` Our policy has been and will continue to be one of strict neutrality. We, along with the rest of the civilized international community, want this war to end. `` In this respect, we strongly support implementation of <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598 and passage of a second resolution imposing an arms embargo on that belligerent that does not accept 598 as a means to reach a diplomatic settlement of this tragic war. `` We also want to see an end to the wanton waste of human life that has characterized this war. In that regard, we especially deplore the use of chemical warfare by either belligerent, which has become one of the most regrettable developments in this protracted conflict. `` This policy will go into effect once we have informed those free world, non-belligerent countries that maintain shipping interests in the gulf.''

 Underground Palestinian leaders urged <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths to keep up the 5-month-old uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and stepped up threats against Israeli-appointed mayors in the territories. `` Boys and girls of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, we need more attacking forces, more giving to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' said the latest underground leaflet, released Friday. `` Every strike at the body of our enemy will bring the day of victory nearer.'' The leaflet said `` the blood of our martyrs must not be spilled for nothing.'' It was released on one of the quietest Moslem Sabbaths in months. No injuries were reported despite calls for protests to honor the 175 Palestinians killed in the anti-occupation violence since it began Dec. 8. Israeli officials, encouraged by the relative quiet this past week, have claimed the `` intefadah'' _ Arabic for `` uprising'' _ was fading. The latest leaflet, signed as usual by the `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Uprising,'' called for more general strikes and `` days of confrontation with occupation forces.'' It also named four Israeli-appointed mayors who have refused the underground's demands to resign, urging `` our masses to strike the severest blows against those ... who are violating our wills and orders.'' The leaflet singled out the mayors of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Bireh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. Scattered protests were reported following Moslem noon prayers Friday. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, soldiers fired tear gas to disperse several dozen youths who hurled stones after prayers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Troops also fired rubber bullets at worshipers in the nearby <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp, the reports said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Friday, hundreds of Moslem worshipers waved outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags on the sacred <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> chanting: `` Jews leave! The prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s army is coming!'' The protesters chanted praise for <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military leader who was gunned down April 16 in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Israeli sources have confirmed that Israeli commandos were responsible, but the government has denied comment. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and their Lebanese militia allies raided two villages on Friday, questioning residents about two guerrilla attacks in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> this week. The army said two militiamen from the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> were killed when their vehicle ran over a land mine on a side road in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed `` security zone'' north of the border. On Tuesday, two Israeli soldiers and three Palestinian guerrillas were killed in a clash after the Arabs crossed into northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In a second incursion Wednesday, two guerrillas were killed. Gen. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peled </PERSON>, head of the army's northern command, pointed a finger Friday at <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for helping the guerrillas. `` Without a doubt, these recent operations came from an area under Syrian influence,'' <PERSON> Peled </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said troops entered the villages of <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rachaiya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Foukhar </LOCATION>, four and six miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, to question residents about the attacks. Security sources in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said they were told five Lebanese had been detained. The army declined comment on the report. Military officials have linked the recent guerrilla raids to the uprising in the occupied lands, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

 A structural failure, not a bomb, likely caused the `` big bang'' that ripped open an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet, injuring 61 people and apparently sucking a flight attendant from the cabin to her death, a federal official said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, which was cruising at 24,000 feet on an island hop from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, made a safe emergency landing at <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> airport Thursday, after flying about 15 minutes with 20 feet of its upper fuselage _ just behind the front passenger door _ torn away to the floor. Witnesses said one engine was on fire. `` There was a big bang when it happened and everybody looked up and we were looking at blue sky,'' said passenger <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. At a news conference late Friday night, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said investigators believed the cause of the accident was a structural problem with the aging jet. `` I think it's fair to say the focus of the investigation is on the structure itself, the hole itself, and what if any causes might have been to create hull fractures or hull fatigue,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON>. The possibility of a bomb having exploded aboard the aircraft has been ruled out, said one source in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. However, <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said, `` We ca n't rule anything in or anything out.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> had ordered a close inspection of the upper skin of older model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s _ including the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> jet _ in October because of cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap and had warned such cracks could cause rapid cabin decompression, according to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We are in full compliance with the October directive,'' <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Friday. She said the inspections have been done as outlined by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and turned up nothing unusual. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records also showed that the Aloha plane had extensive repair work done to mend cracks and corroded metal twice in 1983, but most of that work involved problems with the lower half of the plane, which seemed not to be involved in Thursday's incident. A source close to the accident probe in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said investigators are focusing on whether a structural failure such as metal fatigue or corrosion might have caused the airplane's skin to tear, causing rapid decompression. One theory is that strong winds may then have ripped away the huge upper section of the fuselage from just behind the front door to within a few feet of the wing, sources said. Investigators also believe that it is unlikely that an engine failure played a significant part in the plane tearing apart, a source said. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter and helicopter searched the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> south and southeast of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> for `` anything associated with the explosion of Flight 243,'' according to spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. Searchers had been unable to locate flight attendant <PERSON> Clarabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, a 37-year veteran with the airline, or any debris from the plane, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> officials said they believe <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON> was sucked out of the plane when it rapidly decompressed after the explosion. Passengers held onto another flight attendant so she would not be sucked out of the open plane, according to passenger <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> salesman. Seven of the injured remained at <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Friday. One was in critical condition and one in guarded condtion. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> area coordinator for <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, said some <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators arrived at <LOCATION> Kahului </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Thursday and would hold a news conference Friday. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said he could not confirm whether investigators suspected a structural failure caused the fuselage to tear away from the airplane. `` It stands to reason that they're checking everything _ structure failure, explosive devices,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. The plane was carrying 89 passengers, five crew members and an air traffic controller when the explosion occurred around 1:45 p.m. HST. The plane, traveling about 345 miles per hour, was 25 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. `` There was a blast ... a whoosh, like someone popped a bag ... and the air rushed out immediately,'' said <PERSON> Dennin </PERSON>. `` A third of the roof was gone. ... I looked up and saw blue sky. `` Everybody screamed,'' he said. `` However, it was very brief _ the panic. ... The rest of the plane was intact. ... I think that people realized the plane was still flying and they quickly went about the business of doing whatever they could do to save their lives.'' Passenger <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, said she put on a life jacket and put her head between her knees. `` I sang all the hymns I knew,'' she said. `` That kept me busy.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberly </PERSON>, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he dropped to his knees in shock as he watched the plane land with one of its engines smoking and the section of fuselage missing. `` I saw hair flying in the wind and arms dangling,'' he said. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrant </PERSON>, a tour van driver who helped take the injured to the hospital, said he was struck by the silence of the passengers after the plane landed. `` I guess everyone was so shocked out, everyone was silent,'' <PERSON> Hildebrant </PERSON> said. `` They were very calm, I guess, to compensate for what they went through.'' Passengers praised the pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>, a 12-year veteran of the airline, for a remarkable job in making a safe landing. `` He brought that plane down so smoothly,'' said passenger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>. `` It was just like riding in a Cadillac.'' A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, the main subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said there were no fuel lines or other potential sources for an explosion in the front of the airplane. `` To have it just explode in the air is just unheard of,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. He also said that in the unlikely chance that a turbine blade tore loose from the engine and ripped into the fuselage, it would not have hit forward of the wing. <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> President <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> that nothing is stored in the area where the fuselage was ripped apart. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 was delivered to <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> in 1969 and apparently has been in service ever since, according to Cole. The 737 is one of the oldest of the 737-200 series planes in service, he said. The first of the series was put into commercial service in February 1968 at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s directive for inspection of the early-model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s was issued last year because cracks were discovered during routine inspections near fasteners that join sections of sheet metal in three aircraft. The same inspections also found fuselage tear strips coming loose on some of the planes because the lamination was no longer holding. The repair work needed on the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> jet included fixing in 1983 and several other times since then cracks and corrosion on the wings, according to <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records. A section of the right wing was replaced last year when cracks were found in the wing spar.

 <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Legasov </PERSON>, a physical chemist who led the commission the investigated the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster, has died at the age of 51, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced. Neither <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> nor the evening television news broadcast Vremya on Friday gave the cause or place of death. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Legasov </PERSON> died Wednesday, a day after the second anniversary of the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> in which at least 31 people were killed. It was not known if <PERSON> Legasov </PERSON> was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation while investigating the disaster, the world's worst nuclear power accident. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and scientists signed the obituary carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Legasov </PERSON>'s name had been absent from the dozens of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media reports on Tuesday's anniversary of the accident at the nuclear facility 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Legasov </PERSON>'s foreign colleagues in nuclear power research had praised his openness in discussing the causes and effects of the Chernobyl accident, in contrast to initial Soviet delay in releasing information about it. The accident spread radioactivity worldwide. <PERSON> Legasov </PERSON> was first deputy director of the I.V. <ORGANIZATION> Kurchatov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has asked for the view of a District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> court on whether makers of handguns like the one used to shoot President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> can be sued for deaths and injuries when those guns are used. The legal issue was referred Friday to the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in a case involving <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Delahanty </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> policeman, one of three people wounded by presidential assailant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the 1981 shooting. <PERSON> Delahanty </PERSON> had tried to sue the gun manufacturer. The action by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> raises the possibility that <PERSON> Delahanty </PERSON> and former White House press Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> may revive lawsuits against <PERSON> Roehm </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesellschaft </PERSON>, the West German manufacturer of the .22 - caliber pistol used by The federal court sought the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> court's view because federal courts must apply the laws of the states in which they are located to civil suits. The court noted that <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> law should be consulted since the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> was carved out of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> when the nation's capital was formed A 1985 ruling by <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s highest court made gun makers and sellers liable for injuries and death caused by the criminal use of so-called Saturday Night Specials. The federal court's requst _ an advisory opinion _ is merely a suggestion and does not require a ruling by the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> court. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, assistant general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said of Friday's advisory opinion, `` It's obviously disappointing that this court did n't simply say this theory is so outlandish that we're not going to pay any attention to it. The advisory opinion came a year after the same appellate court upheld the dismissal of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s suit against <PERSON> Roehm </PERSON> and its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, R.G. Industries. In that ruling, the court held <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> did not raise a valid negligence claim because gun manufacturers were not obligated `` to prevent criminals from using their products.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee says states seeking the super collider atom smasher will not have to put up at least $ 500 million in cash or services to land the eagerly pursued research installation. The Space, <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, in a 20-11 vote, rejected the minimum-funds amendment offered by Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, R-Calif., for the $ 4.4 billion superconducting super collider Committee members also voted 16-14 against an alternative that would have required the secretary of energy to report to the committee in six months his recommendations for what the winning state should pay. The amendments were offered to the $ 3.1 billion <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> research authorization bill. As it stands, the bill would authorize $ 1.6 billion over the next three years for the collider, of which $ 148 million would be for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ but with no construction funds until Oct. 1, 1989. Several amendments to the bill remain to be considered, including measures that would sharply reduce the super collider authorization or eliminate it altogether, and to make a 25 percent foreign contribution a requirement for proceeding with the giant atom smasher.

 A top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counter-terrorism expert says there is likely to be a surge in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorism as a result of the uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and the killing of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrilla chieftain.

<TEXT>
 Radio disc jockey <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> thought the idea of spending a day or on the air two waiting for the hapless <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> to win sounded like a challenge. Ten days, or to be more exact, 258 -LCB- hours later, <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> was tired and a bit haggard, but delighted to be going home after the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> defeated the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> 9-0 to break an record 21-game losing streak. `` This is a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> blowout,'' <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> said Friday night on his show at station WIYY-FM as the game neared its conclusion. `` I'm extremely happy and happening I'm going home tonight.'' Throughout the city of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Friday, fans celebrated around television sets or let loose on the streets, where they set off fire works, although police reported no problems. `` It has been outrageous. People have been going nuts,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Coster </PERSON>, a bartender at Balls, a sports bar. `` What a win. It's almost like the'83 World Series here. The <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>, once known as a powerhouse team, won that series. <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, 31, who had promised to stay on the air until the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> triumphed, popped open a bottle of champagne and drank from a plastic <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> beer cup, shouting, `` Ai n't the beer cold?'' The morning deejay's song lineup reflected his new mood. His first was `` I'm Free,'' by The Who. Then came two songs by the rock group Queen _ `` We Will Rock You,'' and `` We Are The Champions,'' marking an upbeat change from the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> lyric `` You Ca n't Always Get What You Want,'' that he played during the darker hours as the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> rolled up loss after loss to set an American League record <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> helped rally <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> fans and through a blitz of national publicity got fans from other cities supporting the home team. His vigil _ broken by occasional naps on a cot in a corner office dubbed the `` Rivers Hilton'' _ was celebrated on national television, talk shows and magazines. <ORGANIZATION> WBAL-TV </ORGANIZATION> sportscaster <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> marked his liberation as well. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> took off the shiny black and orange Orioles baseball jacket he'd worn for more than a week after vowing to keep it on until the O's posted a victory. <LOCATION> Downtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> swelled with fans anxious to see the end of the losing streak, which had gained national attention and brought ridicule to the team. `` We were psyched. I knew they were going to win because everybody wanted them to lose to break the record. Some people were disappointed, but I'm still very happy. We're no longer losers,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> stockbroker and lifelong Orioles fan. The losing streak apparently has done little to weaken the attachment the city of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> has for its <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>. A Fantastic Fans Night has been scheduled for Monday at Memorial Stadium to honor the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> in their first home game in two weeks. More than 44,000 tickets have been sold for the game with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>, which features prize giveaways and musical entertainment. `` We'll all be there Monday night,'' <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said. `` Every single person in this bar will be there.

<TEXT>
 More than a year after <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> asked to join the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, its membership prospects are distant, frustrated by its rivalry with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Talks collapsed this week after a Greek-inspired quarrel over the presence of 29,000 Turkish troops in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Relations between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, two <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies that almost went to war last year over rights to explore for minerals in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, are so poor that one diplomat of the Western alliance told a reporter at its <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> headquarters: `` Do n't ask me about <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in this building.'' On Monday, a meeting in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and Turkish officials was canceled at the last minute following the fight inspired by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> member since 1981. The bid to revive ties with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> ended in `` vituperative exchanges'' between <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and Turkish officials at dinner, one source said. A session afterwards with foreign ministers was abruptly canceled. `` I do n't think any one of us expected this to happen,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Poos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. `` It was not a failure,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The meeting simply `` did not take place.'' <PERSON> Mesud </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>, the Turkish foreign minister, refused to accept the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> view, contained in a statement, that the presence of Turkish troops in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> `` affects the relations'' between it and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON> said the Turkish troops on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> are none of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s business <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1974 to protect the Turkish Cypriot minority after a pro-Athens coup there. But <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, like <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, has an association accord with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and also aspires to join the Common Market someday. The accord gives <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> trade privileges, development aid and a forum to discuss <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> membership. The accord was suspended after a 1980 military coup in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, freezing an $ 748 million aid deal. The cancellation of Monday's meeting was embarrassing for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s staunchest <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ally. It has had good relations with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for more than 100 years. In the 1930s, many thousands of Germans fled their country's Nazi regime to find exile in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The collapse of the EEC-Turkey talks was all the more surprising as it followed recent meetings between <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>, the Greek and Turkish prime ministers, who agreed to step up cooperation. It was hoped a new meeting on the issue can be held before June 30. On that day, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> hands over the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s rotating presidency to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> for six months dimming hopes for progress even further. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is eager to join the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. It prides itself in having a rapid economic growth and liberal economic policies and sees itself as a bridge between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the volatile <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.

 A flight attendant was serving drinks to a passenger and as `` their hands just touched'' she disappeared in an explosion that ripped open the jetliner 24,000 feet above the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, a passenger said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> searchers Friday failed to find any trace of <PERSON> Clarabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, 57, who had worked 37 years for <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` She was just handing my wife a drink,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON> said. `` She had stopped and told us this was the last call. We were going to be descending. `` And then, whoosh! She was gone. Their hands just touched when it happened.'' Sixty-one people were injured Thursday in the accident aboard Flight 243. Federal investigators said they were focusing on possible structural failure in the 19-year-old plane. Passengers praised Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>, 42, who flew the badly crippled plane for about 15 minutes before making an emergency landing on <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. After leaving the plane, many of those who were uninjured sought out the pilot and shook his hand. `` It's tremendous how he controlled the plane,'' passenger <PERSON> Ignazio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinello </PERSON> said. `` The wind was so fantastic; without him we'd never be alive.'' `` I'm so amazed the pilot of the airplane did land it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Toyooka </PERSON>, who said his three days of research for a stock brokerage company went flying out the plane. `` I could n't believe it _ that people are still alive,'' he said. Passengers said that even though the plane was rocking as it headed toward the <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> airport, the landing was smooth. `` It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION>. The pilot's father, also named <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON>, said in an interview from his <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, home that his son did n't seem unsettled when he spoke with him by telephone Thursday night after the accident. `` When we talked to him he was still feeling pretty calm,'' he said. `` He said you're calm about it when you're doing it, but afterwards you start thinking about it.'' `` He says it was just something else _ all of a sudden there was this noise, and the plane's flying funny and there's a big drag on it, so he immediately decided to change the flight plan to land at the <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> airport, which was closest, and he was able to get it in and land it,'' Schornstheimer said. In spite of the passengers' praise, <PERSON> Schornstheimer </PERSON> said his son's actions were all in a day's work. `` He's pretty calm under pressure,'' he said. `` He said he was calm and did what needed to be done, just like any other pilot would have. They were talking about it on TV like -LRB- he was a hero -RRB-, but he said he just did what any other pilot would have done in the same circumstance. But of course, he's skillful enough and trained well enough to do it.'' Passengers also praised other crew members. `` Make sure you tell them about the stewardesses,'' one passenger told a reporter while being wheeled into <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> Memorial Hospitl for treatment. One flight attendant crawled along the aisle, calming passengers and trying to help the passengers put on their life vests, said entertainer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was returning from his honeymoon. `` Everyone went to work to better their chances of surviving a crash,'' he said.

 A Japanese man linked to a terrorist group traveled about 7,000 miles in the month before he was arrested on charges of carrying three powerful pipe bombs in his car, according to federal documents. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 35, pleaded innocent Friday to all charges on the 12-count federal indictment. He was arrested April 12 along the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> and is being held without bond in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. His lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, accused federal prosecutors of creating an atmosphere of hysteria and paranoia by trying to link Kikumura to the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> terrorist group. `` I'm not saying we can win on all counts,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> told reporters outside the courtroom. `` They made it so unfair to start with.'' `` There's been a lot of innuendo about Mr. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> causing a great deal of prejudice,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` References to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> are bad in a country already fearful of terrorism.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>'s charges. `` This case has a lot of international implications and we have had some contact with foreign police agencies,'' <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said later in a telephone interview. `` I'm quite sure that he'll be able to get a fair trial.'' The Japanese foreign ministry has said it suspects <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> of being a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which was blamed for the recent bombing of a USO club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Authorities have said they are investigating whether <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was linked to the group. Court documents filed Friday revealed new details about <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The documents said <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> traveled about 7,000 miles between March 14 and his arrest April 12, staying in numerous hotels and motels and in a trailer at a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> campground. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> filed a request to thoroughly search Kikumura's car, and said three mechanics at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> auto dealership reported seeing a revolver when <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> brought his brown <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> in for servicing March 14. No gun was found during a search of the interior, and authorities suspect it may be in a hidden compartment. <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> hugged <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> when federal marshals brought the defendant into the courtroom in leg irons and handcuffs. The lawyer and his associate, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, said federal attorneys, motivated by political considerations against suspected leftists, built up the number of counts by charging Kikumura for each pipe bomb he allegedly carried. `` This is virtually a triple indictment,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said. Authorities say <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> would face a 90-year sentence if convicted on all 12 counts, which also include charges involving improprieties with a passport and a visa.

 Thunderstorms swirled through the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> today after hitting central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with baseball-sized hail and 11 tornadoes that uprooted palm trees, overturned trailers and ripped roofs from several homes. There were no reports of serious injury. Most of the damage Friday was near <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, where wind tossed trash cans through windows, toppled power poles and damaged cars. `` I saw it. There's no question in my mind. It was not a major tornado, but it was a regular one.

The thunderstorms swept across the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> early this morning, but there were no reports of severe weather.

 Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> sent a telegram to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> protesting a cartoon published in the paper that depicts <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> being turned away from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, the mayor's spokeswoman said. In the telegram, sent earlier this week, <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> objected to the implication <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities closed <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to non-Jews, spokeswoman <PERSON> Sevannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Meryn </PERSON> said Friday. `` In all its history, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> has never been freer or more open to visitors to holy places as it is now,'' <PERSON> Meryn </PERSON> quoted the telegram as saying. `` Half a million Christians visit <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> each year, as well as some 120,000 Moslems from countries technically at war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Even though a cartoon is only a cartoon, it must be based on some reality, and not only on doubtful, hostile impressions and opinions,'' it said. The cartoon by the newspaper's <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, published March 30, shows <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> arriving at the gate to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on a donkey, followed by several robed figures holding palm branches. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier blocks his path, saying: `` <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is a closed military area!'' The cartoon was an apparent reference to the frequent closures imposed by the military in the occupied territories in an effort to quell the 5-month-old Arab uprising. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the cartoon was one of two that angered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzur </PERSON>. The radio said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzur </PERSON> proposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> revoke the press credentials of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>, the ministry's director general, was quoted as calling the proposal a `` stupid idea'' because <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> had nothing to do with the cartoons. The second cartoon, published April 27, depicts an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier holding a smoking rifle standing atop a pile of bullet-ridden bodies. The caption reads: `` I'm willing to talk peace, but there are n't any Palestinians to talk peace with!''

<HEAD>Large Sinkhole Swallows 1 Home, Threatens 2 Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A large sinkhole quickly swallowed a house and two others teetered on the edge in a subdivision near this central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town, authorities said today. Just two hours after it opened Friday evening, the hole had grown to 70 yards wide and 15 feet deep, witnesses and officials said. No injuries were reported, <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's dispatcher <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said `` Every once in a while you can hear a crack'' as it widens, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a 15-year-old who lives a few blocks from the sinkhole. The first home was completely in the hole. The sinkhole also swallowed a garage and was expanding toward two homes next door, Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said. `` The roof's almost even with the road around it,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, a geologist in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> who directs the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinkhole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, said he was surprised to see a large sinkhole in the area. `` We rarely if ever get any that far south,'' he said. Sinkholes are largely caused by the altering of the water table in the limestone and clay under the soil, experts say. A sudden lowering of the water table because of irrigation or drought can weaken and collapse underground limestone caverns, while too much water draining into the ground can dissolve clay-like materials and rock below.

The <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> have pleaded innocent to both the 188-count state indictment and the 47-count federal indictment. According to the indictments, the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION> allegedly spent the $ 4 million to refurbish their mansion with an enclosure for one of the estate's two pools; a breakfast room and marble dance floor on the roof of that enclosure; an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereo system; more than $ 370,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of furniture and paintings.

 A Jewish refusenik said today he had been told he will be given permission to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> temporarily to visit his wife in an American hospital. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON>, 60, said he was called to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine-Building </ORGANIZATION> Friday and told he should be able to receive his passport on Tuesday or Wednesday. The ministry has objected to the former electrical engineer's emigration on the basis that it could damage state security But <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON> said the work the ministry cites is 15 years old. He first applied to emigrate in 1977. <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON>'s 57-year-old wife, <PERSON> Izolda </PERSON>, was granted permission in late December to travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be treated for a brain tumor. She is hospitalized at the <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, where she has had several operations. The couple's son <PERSON> Igor </PERSON>, who emgrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a decade ago, went to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to be with his mother. In a telephone call to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON> said he planned to leave as soon as possible upon completing the Soviet paperwork. The ministry did not know for how long his visa would be valid, he said. <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON> said he also planned to seek medical treatment while in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Doctors have told him he suffers from gallstones and either a herniated disc or a tumor in his back, but Soviet diagnostic equipment can not distinguish which it is. <PERSON> Tufeld </PERSON> said the decision to allow him to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> temporarily showed the inconsistency of Soviet policy. If he does hold information that could compromise <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> security, there would be no sense allowing him to travel abroad, he said. Emigration has increased recently, but does not approach the level of 1979, when more than 51,000 Soviet Jews left the country.

<HEAD>Legislation To Protect U.S. Copyrights Voided After Parliament
Dissolved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dissolution of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has voided a controversial bill to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights, a legal expert said today. Prime Minister <PERSON> Prem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinsulanonda </PERSON> dissolved his Cabinet and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> on Friday after political infighting over the legislation. Elections have been scheduled for July 24. <PERSON> Kramol </PERSON> <PERSON> Thongdhamchart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chulalongkorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said the bill would have to be reconsidered by the next government since it had not passed through several required steps before becoming law. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 183-134 to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights of artistic and literary works which are widely pirated in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had indicated it might retaliate economically if the measure did not pass. The bill still needed approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON>, the country's constitutional monarch, before becoming law, <PERSON> Kramol </PERSON> said. Supporters of the 67-year-old Prem, who has served since 1980, said the action was taken because political dissidents refused to `` play by the rules of the democratic game.'' Political opponents criticized the prime minister for avoiding a probable no-confidence motion in Parliament next month. Sixteen ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ the main party of <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>'s coalition government _ resigned Friday after failing to stop party dissidents from voting against the government-backed copyright bill. The dissidents said the legislation would force <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to bow to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> bullying. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had indicated it would cut tax privileges of Thai imports if the copyright bill was rejected. Radio <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> today quoted a senior government official as saying 357 House seats would be contested in the upcoming general election, 10 more than in the last one in 1986. Representation in the lower house is based on population. <PERSON> Anak </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitthiprasart </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying that the polling would cost $ 9.9 million. <PERSON> Prem </PERSON>, a former army general, is credited with providing <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> with political stability after years of coups and rapid government changes.

 A priest who police say was caught with 46 pounds of cocaine said Satan tempted him to sell narcotics but that he used the profits to help the poor. Intelligence Police Commissioner <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Granadillo </PERSON> said Friday the Spanish-born Venezuelan priest, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 57, was arrested at <ORGANIZATION> Maiquetia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> Wednesday night after police found the cocaine packed in his suitcases. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who for 24 years has been the parish priest at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, 36 miles west of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, was headed for <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. A former priest, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 54, and his wife <PERSON> Graciela </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON>, 46, were arrested hours later in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and are alleged to have drawn <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> into the smuggling trade, <PERSON> Granadillo </PERSON> said. `` I would n't say that the Venezuelan church has been penetrated by traffickers, but -LRB- <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> -RRB- is a priest and he is involved in drug-running,'' <PERSON> Granadillo </PERSON> said in a phone interview. The priest told reporters Thursday that he had smuggled cocaine to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on two previous occasions. He acknowledged he was paid $ 9,000 for the first cargo of 19 pounds in 1984 and $ 32,000 for a second load of about 30 pounds. He did not say when the second operation took place. The 46-pound cargo would have netted him $ 50,000, he said. `` I gave it all to the church,'' <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. `` I paid for a new chapel in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, a parish boarding school, and decorations for the church altar, and I helped out the children who needed the money so much. I have n't got a penny of it. `` I repent and I want to die ... I was tempted by Satan and I know the damage I have done to the church and I deserve punishment,'' he said. He said <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON> had pressured him to carry the drugs and that he had asked his church superiors in March to remove him from the parish `` because I was horribly afraid.'' <PERSON> Fathe </PERSON> <PERSON> Amador </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday that the church is `` disconcerted and full of consternation and pain'' over the case. `` The church does not judge and will let -LRB- Venezuelan -RRB- justice follow its course,'' Merino said. `` In -LRB- <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s -RRB- confusion and good faith, I think he believed that this was the best use for the money made from this nefarious trafficking business,'' he said. He said top <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> church officials visited <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> on Thursday `` to be close to him in these moments of confusion.'' He said did n't know of any other cases of Venezuelan church officials involved in drug smuggling. <PERSON> Granadillo </PERSON> said the priest's activities had been under observation for over a year. Police said formal charges wilt be drawn up against the priest and the <PERSON> Rojano </PERSON> couple next week. Drug smuggling in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> carries a jail sentence of six to thirty years, the nation's maximum penalty.

<TEXT>
 In a rare and highly publicized <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> meeting with Russian Orthodox Church leaders, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised greater religious tolerance and sought support for his drive for domestic change. The Soviet leader also condemned past repression of religious activity. He said a law now being drafted on `` freedom of conscience'' will reflect the `` tangible results of new approaches to state-church relations in the conditions of perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB- and democratization.'' Friday's meeting was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s first with high church officials since he became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in March 1985. Such a meeting is unusual because party doctrine professes atheism. The encounter, reported by the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, was the lead item on the evening news program `` Vremya'' and a front page story in today's editions of Pravda and other Soviet dailies. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said church head Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> had requested the meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief to discuss the June celebration of the 1,000 th anniversary of Christianity's arrival in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said his campaign for the restructuring of society offers benefits to religious believers but also carries obligations that can be met during the 1,000 th anniversary celebration ` On the eve of this event I would like to express the desire that it is marked by the consolidation of our country's believers, all working people, for the sake of our common great cause of perestroika, of the renewal of socialism, complete unfolding of its humanistic ethical potential,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as telling the church leaders. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said his overhaul of society and the economy faces opposition at many levels, so the appeal to church leaders was seen as an effort to enlist the support of another element of Soviet society. He did not specify what the new law governing religion would say or when it would be completed, but said it would `` reflect the interests of religious organizations.'' The law now in effect, dating back to 1929, requires registration of all religious groups, and prevents charitable activities and religious education of the young. Archbishop <PERSON> Kiril </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> told a news conference on March 31 that the rewriting of the law `` will open the possibility for a fuller church life for all believers'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Under Soviet power, the Russian Orthodox Church has been subject at times to harassment and violent anti-religious campaigns. In 1961, Premier <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> predicted the complete elimination of religion in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by 1980. <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>, the 77-year-old patriarch of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and All <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that Soviet religious leaders `` ardently pray for the success of the restructuring process, and strive to do everything possible for its development,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. However, <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> said without elaborating that `` not all problems of church life receive their resolution so far.'' In his talk with the prelates, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged the suffering of religious believers under the late Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` Mistakes made with regard to the church and believers in the 1930s and the years that followed are being rectified,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, without referring to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> by name. Religious believers were among the millions of people killed or imprisoned under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. Churches and their property were destroyed during <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s drive to establish collectives. Under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Soviet media have been reporting extensively on <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s mistakes and repression.

<TEXT>
 The government today denied involvement in the assassination of a man believed to be the leader of an Armenian terrorist group. The man, identified as <PERSON> Agop </PERSON> <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>, was shot and killed Thursday outside his home in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, in an attack by two masked men. The group <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> founded and led, the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, accused <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and `` imperialist allies'' Friday of masterminding the killing. Greek newspapers published similar claims. But Turkish <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Inal </PERSON> <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> today said `` such claims are absurd. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> never used these methods in dealing with terrorism.'' No one claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON>'s killing. One report, from the Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Agopian </PERSON> was fired from the organization in late 1987. The organization, founded in 1975, has taken responsibility for more than 60 attacks against Turkish targets, including the killings of about 30 Turkish diplomats and dependents in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His group said it carried out the July 1983 bombing of the Turkish Airlines desk at <LOCATION> Orly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that killed eight people and injured 56. The Marxist organization seeks an independent Armenian state in eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. It also demands vengeance for what it says was the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1916. Turkish officials acknowledge 300,000 Armenians died after Ottoman Empire officials deported the country's 1.4 million Armenians to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> during World War I. Independent historians say at least 600,000 Armenians died on the trip.

 The government today released two former underground Solidarity leaders from prison in a secret deal with Roman Catholic church officials, but the activists refused to leave the country, family members said. Witnesses and relatives said the two were then returned to a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> prison, but their status remained unclear. A spokesman for the communist government declined comment. The two, <PERSON> Kornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON>, were driven to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s airport to board a flight to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but they decided to stay in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after meeting with family members. The two were released from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Rakowiecka prison early today in an apparent deal between the Roman Catholic church and communist authorities. Both men were leaders of a militant Solidarity splinter group. They were given multiple exit-and-entry passports and were supposed to go to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for unspecified medical treatment. But after meeting with relatives in an airport lounge and hearing of a new wave of strikes, they decided to stay in the country, relatives said. `` They are staying,'' <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, told reporters at the airport. `` They may go at a later date, but they want to think it over.'' <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> were driven back from the airport in two umarked cars. Witnesses who followed said they were returned to <LOCATION> Rakowiecka </LOCATION> prison by security officials. Also present at the airport meeting were three priests from the episcopate and a lawyer. The priests declined to comment. Speaking later to reporters in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>'s daughter said she was surprised that the two men were taken back to prison. `` At first, they agreed to go -LRB- abroad -RRB-. But there was no ultimatum,'' she said. `` They wanted to talk to the families, to consult with each other, because they had no such opportunity in prison.'' She said the two men wanted at least 24 hours to make up their minds. <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoja </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON>'s girlfriend, said official documents indicated the two men were being released at the recommendation of a commission of prison doctors `` due to the required urgent medical examination, which may also take place abroad.'' The two women said <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> suffered from ulcers and teeth problems, while <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> had ulcer symptoms, poor eyesight, and heart and kidney ailments. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Morawiecka </PERSON> said the release of the two men was arranged by church officials and that there had been `` some intervention'' by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>, who was was arrested Nov. 9, was chairman of the militant splinter group Fighting Solidarity. He had been in hiding since the December 1981 martial law crackdown on the labor group Solidarity. The next year, he formed Fighting Solidarity, which differs from the outlawed independent labor federation because it advocates anti-communist political goals. Solidarity emphasizes social and union issues. <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> headed Fighting Solidarity from the time of <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>'s arrest until his own capture in January. He had been in hiding since 1985. Authorities alleged that the two were part of a ring that attempted to smuggle equipment intended for terrorist use from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. They were never formally charged. In a statement in November, <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> denied the allegations. A third, less prominent Fighting Solidarity activist, <PERSON> Krzystof </PERSON> <PERSON> Szymanski </PERSON>, was also released today. In another development, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorny </PERSON>, the Solidarity leader in the southern <LOCATION> Silesian </LOCATION> industrial region, was released after an appeals court on Friday suspended his sentence, Solidarity sources said. <PERSON> Gorny </PERSON> was serving an 18-month sentence at a prison in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> after being convicted of failing to pay alimony and using false identity cards. In September 1986, the government of Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> issued a broad amnesty for political prisoners. Since then, the political activists it has jailed have been held on criminal charges.

 A judge's decision to throw out his temporary restraining order against <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> means students who owe the school more than $ 300 will not be allowed to take final exams next week. <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> had halted the predominantly black private school's crackdown Wednesday. But after a six-hour hearing Friday, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> dissolved the order. University officials estimate there are 600 students who owe more than $ 300 each, and argued that <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s original order had hampered their ability to collect. Students said the crackdown was issued without adequate notice and threatened those students who were having financial difficulties. University President <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said he was `` deeply saddened that it was necessary to go to this length to make that point.'' `` This is not a case of <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> fighting its students,'' he said. `` It's a case of <ORGANIZATION> Tuskegee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> insisting that students learn very important lessons for life.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> ordered the school to leave its business office open over the weekend so students can make payments before exams begin Monday. The university's crackdown on overdue fees had sparked a week of protests, including a sit-in at the administration building last weekend. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pintard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling was a `` serious miscarriage of justice.'' <PERSON> Pintard </PERSON> said university officials should have identified `` categories of students'' who could n't make payments because of financial difficulties, and worked out a timetable for those students. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said he agreed with the students' complaints on a personal level, adding, `` Prohibiting students from attending class is an exceedingly drastic action, with as little notice as was given.'' But he said he had no legal grounds to stop the school policy because the students did n't show that the university's policy was arbitrary or would irreparably injure them.

 Tamil rebels hiding behind bushes opened fire on a bus and its army escort Saturday, killing 10 people and injuring six others, officials said. The military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said five Sinhalese soldiers and five civilians were killed in the attack in dense jungle near <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, about 135 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. More than 50 guerrillas fired from both sides of the road, the officials said. `` The soldiers were escorting the civilian bus, and they died fighting the attackers. We believe the attackers suffered heavy casualties, but we do n't have details,'' one official said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Tamil militia, was responsible for the attack. The ambush came a day after President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a majority of seats to four new district councils The elections were boycotted by major opposition parties. Tamil militants have been fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government for a separate homeland in northern and eastern provinces for five years. In July, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed a peace accord aimed at ending the ethnic war by granting some autonomy to the minority Tamils. The accord has been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, who control major areas of Northern Province. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent more than 50,000 troops to its island neighbor to disarm the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and enforce the accord.

 <LOCATION> MAZAR-E-SHARIF </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A northern strip of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, rich in agriculture and natural resources, is being transformed into a Soviet buffer zone, despite the planned withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops. All nine Afghan provinces bordering the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently were grouped to form a new `` Northern Zone'' with a de facto capital in <LOCATION> Mazar-e-Sharif </LOCATION>, ostensibly to coordinate development programs. Virtually isolated from the rest of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by the towering <PERSON> Hindu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kush </PERSON> mountains, the ethnic minorities of the north are closer in language and culture to the Soviets across the border than to their fellow Afghans in the south. `` For several months, there has been an escalation of Sovietization of the north,'' a foreign diplomat in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said. `` Thousands of young people have gone to school in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Some come home with Russian wives. It's a very classical colonization.'' The diplomat, who spoke on condition he not to be identified further, said the Soviet military withdrawal does not mean the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is abandoning <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> while President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government is still under attack by U.S.-supplied guerrillas `` The Soviets do not want to lose <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The north is a Soviet zone,'' he said. He noted that the `` Northern Zone'' includes <LOCATION> Faryab </LOCATION> province, the Afghan oil region, and said <LOCATION> Faryab </LOCATION> `` is already completely dominated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The Soviets have pledged to start withdrawing their 115,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord signed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> two weeks ago in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mazar-e-Sharif </LOCATION>, the administrative center of <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> province, sits on a flat plain 40 miles from the <LOCATION> Amu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that forms the Soviet border. Almost every car in the dusty town is Soviet-made. Shop names are written in the Russian alphabet as well as in the <LOCATION> Arabic-Persian </LOCATION> script used by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet-style posters extolling the virtues of work and socialism loom over the streets. Early this year, references to the new `` Northern Zone'' started appearing in speeches and newspaper articles in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital. `` The main point behind such rearrangement was to coordinate projects and needs, because this area enjoys rich natural resources _ gas, coal, others,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, secretary of the <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> province central committee of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Afghan officials quickly point out that other Afghan provinces also have been grouped into regional zones. But only the `` Northern Zone'' has its own deputy prime minister. <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masir </PERSON>, minister of mines and industry and former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan-Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, was named to the post two months ago. <LOCATION> Mazar-e-Sharif </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, 180 miles south of the border, are expected to be the last cities vacated by Soviet troops before the Feb. 15, 1989, deadline for final withdrawal. According to Afghan and Western observers who spoke on condition of anonymity, <LOCATION> Mazar-e-Sharif </LOCATION> is one of the most pacified areas of the country. In 1987 the official Soviet news media acknowledged that anti-Soviet guerrillas had launched at least two attacks across the border on Soviet soil. According to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> publication, the Soviets retaliated with attacks that caused `` enormous'' civilian casualties. <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the Soviet-backed Afghan government now controls all but 80 of the 433 villages in <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> province. These figures could not be verified, but 18 months ago Afghan officials said only half the villages were under government control. The nine northern provinces have an estimated 2 million to 3 million inhabitants, about one-fourth of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s total population. Nearly all the people belong to the <LOCATION> Uzbek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kirghiz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tajik </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkmen </LOCATION> tribes _ the same ethnic minorities who live across the border in the Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kirghizia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tajikistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkmenistan </LOCATION>. Western sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> say they strongly doubt the guerrillas, or Islamic holy warriors, can take control of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. But if it does happen, they say the northern zone could serve as a refuge and restaging area for the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government. `` If the situation is very bad in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the government could go to the north for reconquest,'' a non-American diplomat said. `` But I should be very surprised if <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> falls. I think <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will be very well-defended by the Afghan army with Soviet advisers.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At 3.15 p.m. most Tuesdays and Thursdays, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> marches into <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s liveliest political traditions _ Question Time. Armed with a thick notebook of statistics, she jousts with questioning lawmakers amid the roar of others frantic to make a point. Fifteen minutes later she departs, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> begins its business for the day. The public gallery is packed for Question Time, and millions more hear the rhetorical fireworks later on radio and TV. Starting this fall, they'll be able to see the action, too, following a Commons decision to let in television cameras. Born in 1721 to allow lawmakers to obtain information, Question Time has developed into a test of ministerial mettle and, some say, a publicity show. In 1901 a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leader called it a `` scandal,'' and today, many say it is more furious than ever. `` It's turned into a kind of gladiatorial battle,'' says <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>, a specialist in Parliament. `` It's very noisy and very crude.'' `` It's become a waste of time,'' says <PERSON> Tam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalyell </PERSON>, a Laborite expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for five days last year for calling Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> a `` liar'' in Parliament. `` It's hullabaloo.'' The curtain rises on Question Time, a mixture of ancient pomp and modern informality, as 62-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> takes her seat on the government side of the House. Lawmakers lounging on their green leather pew-like benches sit up, alert. Question from <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>: `` In her endeavor to re-establish the bonds of family life, has the prime minister ever given any consideration to the value of a wife? Is she aware that the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ... is offering in compensation two pounds -LRB- $ 3.80 -RRB- per week for each keeper's wife? `` Given that the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> pays the same keepers 45 pence -LRB- 85 cents -RRB- a week for a ferret and 2.30 pounds -LRB- $ 4.37 -RRB- a week for a dog, should she not intervene?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> replies: `` I think the honorable gentleman will be aware that the budget set out considerably to help wives ... We on this side value them very highly.'' The sound and fury rises steadily, and by the time Labor leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> begins criticizing Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s welfare reforms, the prime minister's voice is barely audible. She calls <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s remarks `` utterly futile,'' as lawmakers scream `` Answer the Question!,'' `` You're Wrong!'' and Speaker of the House <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON> cries `` Order! Order!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> relies heavily on statistics for her replies, while some of her predecessors have preferred barbed repartee. The late <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> was once asked: `` Is the prime minister aware of the deep concern felt by the people of this country at the whole question of the Korean conflict?'' To which <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> sniffed: `` I am well aware of the deep concern felt by the honorable member in many matters above his comprehension.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s near-decade in power has led to frustration in opposition ranks, and her personality has caused more friction than perhaps any other <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> leader, <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON> says. `` The strategy she adopts is that you do n't worry if the opposition hates you, you worry about whether your own side thinks you've won,'' says <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>. Some say speakers tolerate more disorder both in debate and Question Time to ensure the protection of minority party rights, but that tolerance has led to increased unruliness throughout the House. One of the worst recent incidents occurred not during Question Time but at the end of a dramatic debate on taxation. In a show of anti-Thatcher rage, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> hard-liner <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> dropped and dented the gold and silver mace, the club that is a symbol of royal authority in the chamber. He was expelled for 20 working days after refusing to apologize. However, <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON> says he feels that generally `` the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proceeds in good order.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> he also believes Question Time may quiet down when television enters the chamber for six months this fall. `` I think the new stars are likely to be the reasonable members,'' he said. Opponents argue that TV will encourage showing off. <ORGANIZATION> Strathclyde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> has offered to teach lawmakers how to perform for television for $ 285 a day but says no one has signed up.

<TEXT>
 The birthplace of English had better mind its p's and q's and improve its English teaching methods at the same time, according to a government study which criticizes how the language is taught in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> The study, released Friday by a government-appointed committee, concluded that most English teachers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were not properly equipped for the job and recommended that many be retrained. Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> welcomed the report. He said his department will incorporate its recommendations into a new curriculum planned by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government in a major shake-up of the nation's educational `` Most schools no longer teach old-fashioned grammar. But little has been put in its place,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said last year when he established the committee to study the situation. The 90-page report follows a yearlong inquiry by the committee into how English is taught in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Panel members include <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, professor of poetry at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; novelists <PERSON> Antonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Byatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> Waterhouse; broadcaster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>; and poet <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kavanagh </PERSON>. They visited schools across the nation before writing the report. The report says all teachers should be trained in English and that each school should have a teacher whose sole job is to ensure that the language is used properly. It adds that national standards should be established to be met by children at the ages of seven, 11 and 16. However, the committee rejected a return to memorizing grammar rules. `` We're not anxious to go back to the idea that you simply learn these things by rote, because all the evidence is that that does n't in fact improve the effectiveness of the children's use of the language,'' said Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingman </PERSON>, vice-chancellor of <ORGANIZATION> Bristol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and head of the committee <PERSON> Kingman </PERSON> rejected the notion that the new standards would discriminate against pupils from ethnic minority groups. Of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 56 million people, about 2.45 million are non-whites, mostly immigrants from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> whose children were born and raised in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` The fact that they may speak a different language at home is irrelevant, because the English language is the way they become full members of English society,'' <PERSON> Kingman </PERSON> said. `` It is a way of ensuring that we do not have an underclass of non-English speakers who are cut off from getting a job and having a career.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the 184,400-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> also welcomed the report. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s English Center, said he was concerned about the notion that all pupils must conform to a standard form of English. `` About 80 percent of pupils do not speak standard English although they speak something very close to it. Any attempt to get kids to speak standard English will just disable them as speakers,'' he said. <LOCATION> Kingman </LOCATION>, a mathematician, said English teachers were not being trained well in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and that children were suffering. `` We take a fairly dim view of English teacher training,'' he said. The report said that by age 7, children should read passages of simple sentences, understand the spoken language, spell common words and write legibly; by 11, they should use punctuation and paragraphs, argue their case on an issue and be aware of dialects. It said 16-year-olds should be able to express feelings, ideas and arguments in writing and speech, make comparisions between English and other languages and use technical terms to describe language. English is the first language of 320 million people around the world and is spoken daily by about a billion people.

<HEAD>College Professor Accused Of Running House Of Prostitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A college professor who once claimed to operate the `` cleanest massage parlor in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'' has been charged with conspiracy to maintain a house of prostitution, law enforcement officials said. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON>, chairman of the business department at <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, is to be arraigned Thursday on the prostitution charge and two counts of income tax evasion, according to Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. The tax charges accuse <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> of failing to file a return with the state <ORGANIZATION> Franchise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for 1985 and 1986. Financial records seized at his home in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION> indicate he earned at least $ 200,000 each of those years, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON>, said his client would plead innocent to the conspiracy charge. `` <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> may have been lax, he may have been negligent in some things, but he did n't know what was going on at the massage parlor,'' <PERSON> Glassman </PERSON> said. The attorney said that while <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> had not filed state tax returns for 1985 and 1986, he was in the process of doing so when his records were seized. The <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Massage Parlor, located across the street from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, adjacent to upscale <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, was closed in February after authorities said it was being used as a house of prostitution.

A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> said the district is evaluating <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON>'s position at the college. `` Under the terms of the state Education Code, the particular charge against <PERSON> Mintz </PERSON> does not enable us to automatically suspend him,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsler </PERSON>, the district's general counsel.

 Neither <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nor his friend and money-raiser <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> assumed great success when they sat down at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's breakfast table one day in the fall of 1986. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was casting an eye toward the presidency, and he had one question. `` He said, ` Look, if I decide to go for this thing, will the money be there to wage a credible campaign?''' Farmer recalled. Farmer responded with some optimism, but a day later he had second thoughts. He called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I'm troubled by one thing,'' he told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I've never raised money for a guy who's at 1 percent in the polls.'' As it turned out, <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> underestimated. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been underestimated all along in this presidential campaign, much as his fall opponent, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has been. Critics fault <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a cold aloofness, a lack of passion, and a presence that creates barely a ripple outside a staged event. Not until <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s primary Tuesday, where he won by 2-to-1 over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, did polls show that as many as half those who voted for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> actually supported him strongly. `` This guy really is the <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON> of presidential politics,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckel </PERSON>, who managed <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign. `` This guy gets more criticism for a winner than anybody I've seen in modern presidential politics.'' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a man who is easy to underestimate,'' says his friend, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>. `` But he is extremely competent and well disciplined and has good values _ and all that comes through to the voters.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had other advantages, aside from money. He was helped by geography and a primary calender that fit nicely with his bases of support. And like any winner he was lucky. He was a beneficiary of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s political self-immolation, the disasters and missteps that befell other opponents, the reluctance of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to enter the race, and the lack of national stature of his opponents. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced his candidacy on April 29, 1987 with a direct shot at the then front-runner <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and his campaign of `` new ideas.'' `` Ask more than whether we have new ideas,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Ask whether we have already made new ideas work.'' He called himself a long-shot when he entered the race. But within a month all that was altered by the revelations of <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s relationship with a young woman `` I do n't think you have any real sense at the time you make that kind of announcement what's likely to happen,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a recent interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I said at the time it's a very, very long shot. I meant it. We're all long shots. I mean, who knows? It's a very unpredictable business. `` I thought that if we could organize well and raise sufficient funds and really work at it _ as I always have _ there was a possibility that we could do it. It's never more than a possibility when you start.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sustained his theme for a year: never mind the charisma, here was a politician who had made government work. He offered as evidence the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economic turnaround, notwithstanding critics who said he did no more than stay out of the way of a boom that was coming anyway. `` I do n't think people are all that naive _ I do n't think anybody really thought he created the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Miracle out of whole cloth,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>. `` But they knew that he'd been a part of it and that he'd seen the future they wanted to achieve.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> with the knowledge that he had a sure win a week later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, his neighboring state. He campaigned in the South, potentially hostile territory, by leaving Dixie to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and concentrating on atypical Southern voters: Jews and retirees in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, Hispanics in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, liberals throughout the region. He was credited with a strong organization and was able to withstand the loss of his campaign manager and top aide, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, in the flap over <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>'s role in campaign sabotage that revealed Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s plagiarism and lapses of judgment. He was also lucky that his third place showing in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was n't viewed as the setback it might have been <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman and longtime friend <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> finish was `` perceived as a strong showing.'' `` Part of the plan was to do well enough in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> so you could preserve the geographic advantage you have in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Had he not done well in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, his support in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> may have softened.'' Critics and supporters will argue over whether <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s belated emergence was a triumph of money over message, but it is indisputable that his financial success made much of it possible. Farmer, who had been treasurer for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> in 1984, initially thought he could raise $ 6.5 million by the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses in early February. His figure was in line with what the wealthiest of the other Democrats were able to raise. But the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign raised $ 17 million by <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucus night _ a financial triumph that gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> an enormous advantage over his rivals and paved the way for his emergence as the likely Democratic presidential nominee. His bankroll allowed him to run campaigns everywhere, and to keep staff in place while opponents were collapsing their efforts into <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. He was prepared, as a result, when the campaign moved into the foreign territory of the South and he was able to survive consecutive losses in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. He headed North after Super Tuesday with $ 2 million in the bank, while his opponents were broke or in debt. How was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> able to do it and not the others? One reason was the network Farmer built, asking not just for contributions but for each significant donor to produce $ 10,000 in contributions from their friends. He got enthusiastic support from Greek-Americans around the country, tapping an igorned but often affluent community that contributed close to one-fifth of his total. Importantly, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s own state had a booming economy and active Democrats accustomed to giving. The race for money, in fact, can be considered one of the major contests of 1988. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won it going away. `` It is n't that candidates lose heart, it's that they run out of money,'' <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said. `` Money is the winnowing factor in this process.'' Former rivals and current supporters alike say the critics of his dispassionate style have missed something that voters found in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s cool temperament. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON>, polltaker for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, said research done for that campaign found a startlingly positive reaction among voters to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on television, particularly in his commercials. He communicated, <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> said, `` an inner strength, a quiet passion, an intelligent commitment to substance.'' `` That is not the typical interpretation that's put on the guy, but I'm convinced of it from research that we have done,'' <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> said. `` Not sort of rip-roaring, table-thumping passion, but deep concern and deep conviction. That speaks well of him. That establishes a bond of trust with the voter.''

 Water rationing begins Sunday, but city residents wo n't discover how much water they will be allotted for another two weeks.

<HEAD>Economy Friendly To Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 From <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s viewpoint, the American economy could n't be friendlier: consumer spending is booming, unemployment falling and the prospects of inflation too ethereal to stir much worry. In fact, the economy's prospects appear so bright that one leading economic forecasting firm has an economic model showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will win the presidency on Nov. 8 with 53 percent of the vote. That forecast by <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> uses a computer model which combines what is already known about the economy's performance over the past six months with the firm's expectations for growth and inflation between now and election day. Using an economic model to forecast an election still six months may be going out on a limb, but economists said the exercise does highlight the importance economic issues play in voters' decisions. `` The model has been correct in the past. People do vote their pocketbooks,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION>. `` When things are going well, they want more of the same and that is what Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is promising.'' At the start of the year, things did not look as promising for the Republicans. The 508-point stock market plunge on Oct. 19 had spawned widespread fears that the country would fall into a recession in the early part of 1988. In the three months following the collapse, consumer spending fell by the biggest amount since 1980 when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was president. Consumer spending accounts for two-thrids of overall economic activity, and that decline toppled the country into a brief recession which is cited as one of the factors leading to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s re-election defeat. But this time around, the economy kept rolling. The government reported last Tuesday that consumer spending, propelled by strong auto sales, rebounded nicely in the first three months of the year, providing the momentum for 2.3 percent growth in the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product. The economic expansion, which has now lasted for a peacetime record of 64 months, has driven the unemployment rate down to a nine-year low of 5.6 percent. The unexpectedly strong growth this year and the big gains in employment are raising some concerns that inflation is about to become a problem again. Economists are worried that with job markets growing tight and many industries operating at high capacity rates, demand will start to push prices higher. Prices at both the retail and wholesale levels took a big jump up in March, raising fears in financial markets that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to step in with a dose of higher interest rates aimed at cooling off demand. Some analysts believe the central bank has already tightened slightly and they predict interest rates will be pushed up another notch if next Friday's unemployment report shows the jobless rate dipped further to 5.5 percent in April. But many analysts believe the increases in inflation and interest rates likely to occur over the next six months will be so small that they wo n't prove worrisome to voters. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that interest rates will only increase by one-half to one full percentage point and this will not be enough to curb what he expects will be generally good economic growth this year. `` If the economy does as well as expected between now and November that should be awfully good news for the Republicans because presidents get the credit or the blame for the economy's performance whether they deserve it or not,'' <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON> said The Democrats can be expected to try to focus the campaign on such problems as the huge budget and trade deficits and the unease Americans feel about the country's slide in the past eight years into the status of the world's leading debtor nation. `` Questions about whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be able to compete in the future and what Americans' living standards will be should affect the outcome as well,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, another economist forecasting firm. But other analysts said these issues remain distant abstractions when compared to such pocket-book matters as jobs and inflation. Analysts also said that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s exceptional luck with the economy appears to be rubbing off on his vice president. While the country had to endure the steepest recession since the Depression in 1981-82, the recovery was well underway by the time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had to run for re-election. Many economists are predicting the next downturn will begin in 1989, leaving plenty of time for the recovery to start before the next presidential election. `` It is almost magical the way the economy has performed the right way for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at just the right time,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a lucky man to be second in line to the luck of the Irish.''

 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has quietly expanded its troop commitment to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by up to 10,000 over the past five months while taking an increasingly active role in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> peace negotiations, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The officials made the disclosure as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, along with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, prepared for a new round of talks on an array of southern African issues. The talks, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, mark the first time that South African and Angolan representatives have agreed to sit at the same negotiating table to discuss a peace settlement. The two countries have been military rivals for more than a decade. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had not taken a direct part in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> peace negotiations until January when <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials joined Angolan negotiators for talks with a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who asked not to be identified, said that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is believed to have had between 35,000 and 37,000 troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as of last November. Since then 8,000 to 10,000 Cuban troops have been sent to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, bringing the total to between 43,000 and 45,000, the officials said. This is believed to be the largest number of Cuban troops deployed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since they were first sent there in 1975 when <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> won its independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. If the Cuban and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> populations are compared, the current <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop commitment in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is proportionally far greater than the American military involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1968 when 525,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen _ the all-time high _ were stationed there. Since early March, about 5,000 Cuban troops have been sent to the western Angolan city of <LOCATION> Benguela </LOCATION>, the officials said. The area is not close to any combat zones in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s motives for the buildup are not clear. The Cubans generally have stayed away from combat zones in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war but a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> defector, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, has said that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has suffered about 10,000 casualties since 1975. Cuban troops were initially sent to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> that year to protect the country's Marxist government against attacks from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Recently, South African forces have been assisting the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel group in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. This is one of the issues delegates from the four countries will discuss at this week's meetings in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is eager for an end to the South African presence as well as a suspension of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. The highest priority for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is an agreement for the early withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said that once that hurdle is cleared, it will implement a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for independence and black majority rule in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor which has been ruled by <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> since early in the century. However, there has been no agreement on a timetable for the mutual withdrawal of foreign forces from both <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The head of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> will be Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, who has been attempting since 1981 to negotiate both Namibian independence and a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.

 Born poor in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, 46 years ago, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has capitalized on his role as the nation's most prominent black leader to maintain a comfortable lifestyle and accumulate sizable wealth _ all without holding elected office or drawing a regular paycheck. He has kept busy, even without his portfolio as leader of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he founded and led until before his 1984 presidential campaign. In recent years his income has run into six figures, and before his current campaign <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> traveled the world far and wide, acquiring foreign policy experience during trips financed in large part by black church groups and business supporters and in some measure by sympathetic political groups or foreign nations. The Democratic contender's most recent financial disclosure form, which presidential candidates are required to submit, shows he had assets worth a minimum of $ 347,010, and possibly much more. He owns modest houses in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> home his mother occupies. His wife owns stock worth at least $ 250,000, records show. And, according to spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has signed a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster that brought a $ 350,000 advance for his soon-to-be published autobiography. Some of that money will be shared with people helping write the book, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. With the eager assistance of black churches, business supporters, special interest groups and host governments, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has managed to travel the world as a self-made diplomat on missions of his own making. He has embraced <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; accepted a cigar from <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>; conferred with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>; advocated anti-apartheid civil disobedience in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>; and persuaded <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to release <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> whose plane was shot down over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by Syrian gunners. He even showed up at the first summit meeting between <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave him an audience. The Democratic presidential contender says he has visited at least 35 countries and met with about 60 heads of state. The question _ who pays for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>? _ is difficult to answer partly because <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not released his recent income tax filings or other financial data beyond what is required by federal election law. But no matter where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> goes, someone else often pays. On the campaign trail, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> loves to tell how he allied himself with the workingman by standing with the striking meatpackers in <LOCATION> Cudahy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, in their hour of turmoil in April 1987. He does n't mention that he was paid $ 2,000 plus expenses by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for making that appearance. When he registered voters and laid the groundwork for his 1988 campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was on the payroll of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which he founded during his 1984 presidential bid to promote voter education. Between 1986 and 1987, the group paid him $ 18,750, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s financial disclosure shows. At home in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> between his 1984 and 1988 campaigns, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was protected and chauffeured by two city police officers because he has received many death threats. Police escort him when he visits <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, too. The anti-nuclear activists in <LOCATION> SANE-FREEZE </LOCATION>, a peace group, paid his fare when he jetted to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November 1985 for his informal meeting with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as the Soviet leader awaited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` All of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s thing has been a sort of whoever-will-help, but that's the nature of the civil rights movement,'' says <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> H.H. <PERSON> Brookins </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter and leader in the African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` His whole thing is a kind of get-as-get-can. He's not one of these guys who's got it built in.'' Black churches across the nation always have helped underwrite <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s trips abroad and his work at Chicago-based PUSH -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Serve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanity </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Brookins </PERSON> said. Says <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` Their congregations are supportive of our efforts. So if we need $ 8,000 or $ 18,000, we just indicate what we need.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>, for instance, said he has helped <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finance his foreign diplomacy. `` There are certain ministers that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> can call and ask for $ 1,000 and we'll give it to him without any questions asked,'' said <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>, pastor of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` We have a network. I remember when PUSH could n't make its payroll one time. I had three hours to raise $ 8,000 and I did it because of the cause.'' To illustrate his point, <PERSON> Holley </PERSON> said that in 1984 the Rev. <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> regularly donated money to help support <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s family while the candidate was campaigning and not drawing a salary. When a trip abroad was planned, <PERSON> Holley </PERSON> said, a telephone conference call was set up with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and several ministers. `` All of us would say how much we can raise and ask him things like, ` Are you sure that's enough? Who do you want to take along with you?''' <PERSON> Holley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also has accepted the hospitality of foreign governments to defray the costs of his hotel accomodations, food and in-country travel during some of his trips abroad. In August 1986, for instance, as world attention focused on rioting in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> toured <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, and met with their leaders. Nigerian President <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Babangida </PERSON> provided an airplane, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. His hotel accomodations, food and other expenses were provided by the host government in each country, he added. Interest groups also have helped finance <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s diplomacy. In December 1986, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> where he met with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> where he visited dissident leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, who was under house arrest at the time. Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahne </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> pastor who helped organize the trip, said the air fare and other expenses for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and five others were paid by a coalition of human rights groups from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The South Korean leg of the trip was paid for by that country's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ahne </PERSON> said `` Usually, when we go abroad we are the guests of some human rights organization or some church or -LRB- are at -RRB- the courtesy of some government,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Or if we must pay, we simply target the money for that particular trip and raise it.''

<HEAD>Bush Recruits Old Hands For Party And Campaign Posts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, having clinched the Republican presidential nomination, is moving quickly to fill key campaign posts and to assert control over the party structure for the fall election. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> closely identifies with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on issues, he is putting his own stamp on his campaign organization, casting a wide net in assembling a convention and general election team. And while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talks frequently about involving `` new people,'' many of his key choices are old political pros that date back to earlier administrations and campaigns. A major casualty of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reshaping of the party apparatus appears to be <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmons </PERSON>, who had been under contract with the party for help on the 1988 convention. <PERSON> Timmons </PERSON>, who oversaw both the 1980 and 1984 Republican conventions, has effectively been replaced by <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a wealthy <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> businessman and former <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration official picked to head <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention effort. `` We wanted to have our own guy running it,'' said a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign official who insisted upon anonymity. The official said <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> was chosen for his managment abilities. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> is a senior <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive. As a special assistant to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1972, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> oversaw a program of redirecting federal grants to reap political gain for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Dubbed the `` responsiveness program'' the scheme was roundly condemned by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Watergate committee. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> was selected for the convention job even before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination last Tuesday with the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, which raised his delegate total to over the 1,139 delegates needed at the convention in August in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Political consultants <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, who played a role early in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 primary campaign but left before he won the nomination, will be given major posts in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> effort, campaign sources said. <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> helped out in the Reagan-Bush 1984 re-election campaign. Black most recently had been a senior political adviser to Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who withdrew from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> contest in early March. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deputy campaign manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> has been assigned to be campaign liason to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` ` New people' means people that are n't necessarily the same people that had the same jobs in the conventions year after year,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` It does n't have anything to do with who they supported in earlier elections. The vice president's an umbrella candidate.'' Said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>: `` We're not going to bring in a bunch of novices. We want to bring in people who know what they're doing.'' At the heart of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign are six men upon whose advice <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> relies heavily and who meet regularly to plot strategy. They include <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aide who worked in the 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> pollster who has taken on the role of chief campaign strategist; <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who runs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential office; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, a wealthy <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil industry executive. Also: <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, a onetime media adviser to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> who has prepared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for debates; and former Sen. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, an investment banker and longtime friend of the vice president's. This inner circle is referred to at campaign headquarters as `` G-6,'' an apparent inside joke that draws on the parlance of international econmics and anticipates the expected arrival to the campaign of Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who ran <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1980 campaign and oversaw the 1984 Reagan-Bush effort, is expected to come aboard this summer as the campaign's senior adviser. Then the group will become `` G-7,'' the same designation given to meetings of finance officials from the world's seven major industrialized nations in which <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has been an active participant. When will <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> resin as treasury secretary to accept a campaign assignment? `` Any time he's ready to,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON>, who has served with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> off and on for many years, is also viewed as a key campaign strategist. Outside the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequently seeks the advice of Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>CHICAGO: raise it.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 During his 1984 presidential campaign, for instance, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> raised the money for two major trips to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He traveled to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in June 1984 and to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> the following month. Neither trip was paid for by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. Supporters were asked instead to donate to a `` humanitarian fund'' set up by campaign attorney <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Coaxum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Coaxum </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> attorney, did n't return repeated telephone calls seeking further information and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said he did n't know how much the fund raised or whether it was incorporated. It is n't unusual for public figures to travel abroad at someone else's expense. Foreign governments frequently invite congressmen, by themselves or in delegations, to visit, and absorb the costs. Candidates sometimes use funds from their political action committees for trips that burnish their foreign policy credentials. While <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has traveled abroad extensively, he apparently has n't drawn a regular salary since stepping down as the head of PUSH in 1983 to wage his first presidential campaign, according to his financial disclosure forms and PUSH financial records. From 1978 through 1980, he was paid about $ 50,000 a year as the national president of PUSH. He received $ 54,615 in both 1981 and 1982, the last year that he drew a salary from the organization, according to PUSH records filed with the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> attorney general's office. In 1983, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made about $ 115,000, according to income tax returns that he released during his 1984 presidential campaign. Of that 1983 income, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> earned $ 37,342 in speaking honoraria. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has parlayed his charismatic style into a prominent source of income on the lecture circuit since his 1984 campaign, according to his financial disclosure statement filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In August 1984, he started <ORGANIZATION> Personalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company run out of his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home, to receive his speaking fees and other income, according to his attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was paid $ 192,090 by Personalities between January 1986 and Oct. 6, 1987, according to the candidate's financial disclosure statement. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also signed a one-year contract in October of that year with Agency for the Performing Arts, a prominent Hollywood talent agent. The company agreed to deliver <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> $ 1 million in engagements for speeches, along with television and radio appearances as well as a newspaper column. The company's commission was to be 10 percent. The agency sued <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in November 1986 for $ 10.1 million, alleging he reneged, but the suit was settled out of court recently. Collecting speaking fees _ or honoraria _ is a common practice among politicians. Senators are allowed to keep up to 40 percent of their $ 89,500 salaries in honoraria. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> reported receiving $ 31,950 in honoraria in 1986. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the other hand, reported on his 1986 income tax forms that his only earned income was the $ 85,000 he received as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Before becoming a candidate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traveled occasionally as governor, attending meetings with other governors and making a foreign trade mission to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Those trips were charged to the state. Occasionally, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> charged trips to his political campaign committee, which dissolved only after his presidential committee was established in April 1987. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also disclosed that he has assets in bank accounts and owns stock worth at least $ 347,010. The disclosure form does n't require candidates to list the precise value of such assets One of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> family's most valuable holdings apparently is stock listed in his wife <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>'s name in <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm that owns seven radio stations, the Apollo Theater, a record company and a production firm that syndicates the television program, `` It's Showtime At The Apollo.'' On his disclosure form, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lists the <ORGANIZATION> ICBC </ORGANIZATION> stock as worth more than $ 250,000, but <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, the company's chairman and a long-time supporter of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s work at Operation PUSH, refused to say how much the stock would be worth if it were sold. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> contended in a telephone interview that recent news reports quoting him as saying the stock was worth more than $ 1 million were inaccurate. `` I have no idea what it's worth,'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` We have n't sold any on the open market. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksons </ORGANIZATION> invested with him in 1970 when he was struggling to start <ORGANIZATION> ICBC </ORGANIZATION> and have `` let their investment ride.'' He declined to disclose their initial investment or how many shares of stock they now own. <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> real estate broker, said he sold <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home in a middle-class neighborhood for $ 49,500 in 1970. He estimated that today the home would be worth about $ 175,000. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> paid $ 100,000 for his home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but he did n't know how much he paid for the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, home that his mother lives in.

<HEAD>Striking Seamen Fight on Thatcher's Battleground</HEAD>

 Hundreds of pickets who massed behind police lines as two strikebreaking ferries sailed into <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> on Saturday are on the front line in a battle against Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s labor policies. Like other unions that mounted major strikes in recent years _ steelworkers, coal miners and newspaper printers _ the seamen milling on the dockside of this English Channel port say they are fighting for survival. `` You can take our money, but you ca n't take our minds, you ca n't take our hearts,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> McCluskie </PERSON>, leader of the 24,400-strong <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION>, whose three-month strike has crippled P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION>' cross-channel fleet. `` We will stand together.'' The rhetoric has the ring of yesteryear's battles to save jobs and retain restrictive work practices that critics say slowed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economic recovery. Even as the pickets cheered <PERSON> McCluskie </PERSON>'s call for unity, P and O's strikebreaking ferries, Pride of <LOCATION> Bruges </LOCATION> and Pride of <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, were steaming toward <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>. Their crews were drawn from the 1,100 P and O ferry workers who have returned to work on company terms. The pickets are among 720 refusing to go along with P and O's plans to trim its staff and impose longer working hours. P and O has fired the strikers. The company's main rival, <ORGANIZATION> Sealink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to keep its fleet in operation by invoking union-curbing legislation passed since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> came to power in 1979. Sealink has asked a court to seize the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.3 million in assets under a 1984 law barring sympathy strikes. But the company has moved hesitantly because it does not want to trigger a nationwide strike. Sealink's nervousness and a series of delays by P and O before the strikebreaking ferries slipped their moorings showed that the union still has clout. Moreover, ships' officers are wary of sailing with non-union crews, and picket lines discourage potential ferry passengers. The Conservative government's law that makes unions liable for damages over sympathy strikes is the one that helped crack prolonged and often violent stoppages by newspaper production unions and coal miners. P and O Chairman Sir <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> says the company must slim down and relax work practices or be killed by competition from the Channel Tunnel between <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, scheduled to open in 1993. <PERSON> McCluskie </PERSON> and his strikers also see the battle in apocalyptic terms. `` When I joined the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> as a cabin boy, I thought I had a job for life,'' said a 38-year-old seaman who identified himself only as <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> for fear of losing his job. `` If we lose this,'' he said, `` that's the end of jobs for British seamen.'' For the seamen's union, the strike is the bitter fruit of industrial decline. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s once-mighty shipbuilding industry has collapsed, and many British shipowners have switched to flags of convenience and hired foreign crews to cut labor costs, as have shipowners in other industrialized countries. Its membership having fallen from 150,000 in the 1950s to below 25,000 today, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION> sees the cross-channel ferries as its lifeblood.

<HEAD>Seoul To Consider Contributing To Defense Cost In Persian Gulf</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will consider any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to contribute to the cost of protecting shipping lanes in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, a top <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Saturday. The official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sates </LOCATION> is expected to make the request when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Deputy Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on May 10-11. `` If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes a formal request, we will study it,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Korean newspapers reported from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will ask <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to help defense efforts in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by providing $ 20 million worth of free maintenance to American warships. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is guarding the shipping lanes which have become dangerous most notably because of Iranian attacks on neutral shipping. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacks neutral shipping in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> strikes on Iranian oil industry targets. The two countries have been fighting for 7 -LCB- years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which imports more than half of its crude oil requirements through the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, is obliged to contribute to the defense cost, the reports said. The ministry official denied that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has received any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request. The <ORGANIZATION> Dong-A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, a leading South Korean newspaper, said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> made an informal request through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military channels a month ago. Dong-A, quoting unnamed Korean government sources, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is also asking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to aid the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as part of efforts to step up security in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has not made any decision on the matter, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Dong-A </ORGANIZATION> said even if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> decides to accomodate the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for contributing to the defense efforts in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, it would be in the form of `` technical assistance'' rather than cash or sending troops or warships. The official said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would have to be careful about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request because `` contributing to the defense efforts in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> would consequently mean our involvement in the war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' `` Since we are in a delicate position between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, we can not accept any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request in its entirety,'' the official said. The official said, however, that <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> would favorably consider another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to provide more money for the support of 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> currently contributes more than $ 100 million annually in direct upkeep cost, in addition to $ 1 billion indirectly through tax and rent exemptions for the public lands used by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military here. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is reportedly asking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to increase the direct upkeep cost by $ 120 million a year. News reports quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which enjoyed a record $ 9.78 billion trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, can afford to contribute more.

 Steel workers at one plant ended a one-day strike today, but organizers said 16,000 others remained on strike in a larger mill in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s severest labor unrest in six years. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the government not to use force to break up striking workers. The labor crisis, now in its sixth day, is the most serious to confront communist authorities since they declared martial law in December 1981 and banned the independent Solidarity labor federation. The new strike wave began Monday, when bus and trolley drivers won a 60 percent wage increase with an 11-hour stoppage in the northwestern city of <LOCATION> Bydgoszcz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told regional Solidarity chiefs to organize protests and work stoppages if the government sends security forces against strikers. `` I am warning against the return to the policy of terror, which is apparently supposed to defend reforms, while in reality it defends the way of governing which has led <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to ruin,'' he said in a statement read Friday by an aide over the telephone from <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s apartment in the northern port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. Opposition sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said workers from the giant Lenin shipyards in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, textile plants in <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, and workers in <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> and at least two other cities warned they would stop work if force was used at the two steel mills. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said about 7,000 strikers stopped striking today and left the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> plant 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It said there had been no negotiations between the management and strikers. But <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Surdy </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, said, `` They -LRB- the management -RRB- gave in to all their financial demands.'' They had demanded a $ 50 monthly pay raise, reinstatement of coal allowances and release and reinstatement of three Solidarity activists, detained after Solidarity's call for the strike. The agency said the strikers would lose pay for the time they stopped work but mentioned no other action against them. The plant's management on Friday threatened to fire all strikers. The government has been moving to stem unrest on Sunday, which is May Day. The international Labor Day is traditionally celebrated by the government and used by Polish workers to air their grievances publicly. On Friday, police in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> detained <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a leading opposition intellectual, and six other Solidarity leaders, union spokesman <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON> said today in the capital. That brought to at least 33 the number of opposition activists taken into custody across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since Thursday. Also today, four labor leaders were released from government custody. <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, wife of Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, said her husband and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Solidarity leader <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> were driven to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by police from <LOCATION> Lublin </LOCATION> and released. The two were detained Thursday in <LOCATION> Lublin </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, two former underground Solidarity leaders were released from prison today and taken to an airport for a flight to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but relatives said they refused to leave the country. <PERSON> Kornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> were then driven back to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rakowiecka </LOCATION> prison. They had been released in a secret deal between Roman Catholic and communist authorities, the relatives said. In the southern city of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, transport workers failed to heed a Solidarity call for a strike today to support stoppages for more pay and union rights by workers who had occupied the two steel mills _ one in the <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION>; the smaller one in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, 100 miles to the east. <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON> said transport workers had postponed plans for a strike today in Plock, an important petrochemical center in central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Surdyk </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> said one shift of the 5,000-worker steel mill in <LOCATION> Bochnia </LOCATION>, just east of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, staged a brief strike Friday but later suspended their action. He said they would resume the stoppage Monday if the <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> strike is not settled. Prices have risen 42 percent so far this year because the government reduced subsidies on many consumer items as part of a program to make the sagging economy more market-oriented. Labor Minister <PERSON> Ireneneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON> said Friday the government would soon announce tax law changes and other measures that would allow enterprises to meet growing worker pressure for higher pay. He gave no details. Three times in postwar <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ in 1956, 1970 and 1980 _ widespread labor unrest has caused government shakeups. Strikers in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> are demanding an immediate 50 percent increase in their average monthly pay of $ 105 and a doubling of the $ 15 paid monthly in compensation for recent price increases to all industrial workers, teachers, health care workers and retirees. Plant deputy director <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Razowski </PERSON> told state-run radio today that the strikers' demands for more pay were impossible to meet: `` We can not allow the steelworks to become insolvent.''

 <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> police have launched a search for smuggling rings suspected of luring young Bangladeshi women into foreign prostitution, police sources said Saturday. The sources said more than 50 women, most under the age of 30, were reported missing by their families in the last two months. Most were believed to have been taken abroad as prostitutes, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Some of the women came to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> for jobs in factories or as maids, the sources said. Salaries are low, and some of the women may have sought better-paying work abroad, they said. The government is considering introducing legislation that would provide a death sentence for people convicted of human trafficking. The current maximum penalty is five years in jail.

<TEXT>
 A consumer action group has called for a boycott of <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to protest what it considers the negative effect of fast food on society and the environment. The boycott is being mounted by the <ORGANIZATION> Volksmund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes a variety of local, grass-roots initiatives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Weilandt </PERSON>, a Volksmund spokesman, said Saturday the group called the boycott because it is concerned about the effects of the fast-food chain's `` vigorous marketing efforts directed at children.'' <PERSON> Weilandt </PERSON> said the group also wants to boycott McDonald's `` to call attention to a worldwide industrialization of the food industry that is having catastrophic results on the environment and on agriculture.'' Officials of the giant <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> food concern say they plan no action against the group, but many franchise owners are upset because the group receives money from the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` We are not looking for a fight with the church at all,'' McDonald's marketing supervisor <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreiner </PERSON> was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as saying. Earlier this month, several McDonald's franchise owners threatened to stop paying church taxes because of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s support for Volksmund. <PERSON> Kreiner </PERSON> said McDonald's understood the anger of some of its franchise owners but would not undertake any action against the church, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> report, which appeared in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Rundschau daily on Friday. The Volksmund group says fast food is unhealthy and that it worsens local litter problems. The group also charges that <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> forces employees to work part-time to avoid paying them benefits. `` We are targeting <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> because it has perfected these worldwide strategies,'' <PERSON> Weilandt </PERSON> said. Officials at the Duesseldorf-based headquarters for McDonald's in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could not be reached for comment Saturday There are about 262 <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Former Stripper at Jack Ruby's Carousel Nightclub to be Ordained</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A one-time stripper and star attraction of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>'s infamous Carousel nightclub will be ordained Sunday and says she hopes to work as a jail chaplain, counseling prostitutes, alcoholics and drug addicts. `` I think that's where there's so much sadness and hurt. And nobody knows the pain unless you go through it,'' <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON> said. At 13, she said, she dreamed of becoming a nun named Sister <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>. Instead, she became a stripper named <PERSON> Shari </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON>. She will become the Rev. <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON> in an ordination service Sunday at the interdenominational Eagle's Nest Cathedral. As a teen-ager, she dropped out of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Ursuline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. She was a stripper by the time she was 22 and a prostitute by 30. She was working at the Carousel in 1963 when <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> on national television. But by that time she had started drinking heavily and she does n't remember many of the events surrounding the slaying of the man who killed President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` It was like a dream phase,'' she said. And along the way she was married five times and attempted suicide several times. Four years ago, at 50, while being treated for alcoholism in an <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> hospital, she said, a compassionate psychiatrist pointed her in the right direction. She started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and got religion. `` I'm completely delivered now from everything,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm so full of joy and thankful to heaven. I just feel like I could hang the moon today.'' Ms. <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Ursuline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> to work as a drugstore clerk and cocktail waitress to help support her 10 brothers and sisters. Her parents were divorced and her stepfather did n't have a job. Club owners persuaded her to become a stripper, earning $ 250 to $ 500 a week. `` I was good. I'm not bragging, but I was good and clean and honest and the women liked me, too. When the women like you, it's OK for their husbands to like you,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Meserole </PERSON> But when the men liked you, it was easy to slip into prostitution, she said. She did that to put food on her family's table after her mother died Her income increased to $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 a week. `` When you have to feed people, you do n't have much choice,'' she said. When she turned 40, the dream had become a nightmare, she said. She quit stripping and prostitution and `` just stayed drunk for 10 years,'' she added. When she got out of the hospital, she met the Rev. W.V. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, pastor at the Eagle's Nest Cathedral, and enrolled in classes to become a minister. She now works for a housekeeping agency, cleaning two houses a day and making about $ 400 a week. People who knew her in the past ca n't believe she's the same woman. `` My old friends think I'm square now. Square and broke,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Bishop <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, about to become the first black archbishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, returns this week to a South he believes has `` come of age'' since he left his native <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> 36 years ago bearing childhood wounds of racial prejudice. The 53-year-old <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, an auxiliary bishop in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, archdiocese since 1974, will be installed Thursday as archbishop of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, taking charge of a 69-county region of northern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> recalls a childhood in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, in which, for example, he and his sister were kicked out of a coin-operated laundry because they were black. But he said in a recent interview feels `` personally very comfortable'' about returning to the South. `` I think that the South has changed and come of age and grown,'' he said. `` In many ways, the race question has been more effectively addressed in much of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> than it has been in the North. `` I think I will be able as a black person to function better in a Southern situation, as a Southerner, than I might be able to function in some Northern situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>'s appointment by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in March came more than two years after he and other black bishops wrote a pastoral letter calling on the church to increase the number of blacks in official positions. One of only 12 black bishops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> became the first to hold an office in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> when he was elected secretary of the organization in 1985. But despite his role as a trailblazer for blacks in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church, and despite <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s long tradition in the civil rights movement, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said he does not necessarily see himself becoming a leader in that struggle. `` I certainly am open to any position that presents itself to me,'' he said. `` But I do n't think leaders go out and become leaders. I think the situation and the need on one hand, and opportunities and character and ability on the other, come together and that's what produces a leader.'' Still, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said he's `` delighted and honored and thrilled'' to be moving to a city `` with a magnificant legacy and such a beautiful tradition of leadership in this movement.'' <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> will succeed Archbishop <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnellan </PERSON>, who died Oct. 15. He said he plans to spend his first year traveling around the 21,445 square miles of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> archdiocese, which has a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> population of 156,000 out of a total population of 3.7 million. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said Catholics in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> archdiocese should not expect `` anything tremendously new or different'' under his leadership. He said his most immediate goal will be to identify the poor in the area and `` call the people of the church to a greater awareness of the presence of the poor.'' As the sixth of eight children growing up in a traditional Catholic family, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> attended elementary and high school at Our Mother of Sorrows Parish in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION> and decided at an early age to become a priest. In 1952, at age 18, he entered the <ORGANIZATION> Josephites </ORGANIZATION>, an order founded in 1893 to minister to blacks. After four years at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, he completed his studies for the priesthood at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and was ordained a priest in 1962 He taught science and religion at the minor seminary in <LOCATION> Newburgh </LOCATION>, then received his Master of Arts degree in religious education from <ORGANIZATION> Fordham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1967. He was named spiritual director of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1968 and three years later was elected vicar general of the <ORGANIZATION> Josephites </ORGANIZATION>. During his 14 years as an auxiliary biship in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> was known as an advocate for the poor, the imprisoned and the homeless, frequently serving as their spokesmen before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think that one of the principal demands that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> places on the church and upon those who are the ministers of the churches is to reach out to the poor and the homeless, to those who are without shelter,'' he said. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said he also intends to bring the message that `` we must be a welcoming church, we must be an evangelizing church,'' particularly to blacks who make up less than 3 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are not looking to draw people away from their own churches,'' he said, `` but we certainly want to invite people who have no religious affiliation to come and see what it is that we have.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

If you continue to be right, it's pretty hard for your adversary to overcome,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said in a recent interview. But although <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> quotes <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibran </PERSON> and gets misty-eyed over the selfless nobility of King <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Lancelot </PERSON> in `` Camelot,'' his favorite movie, passive resistance is not his only tactic. President of Machinists District 100 since 1979, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> represents 12,000, or more than one-third, of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s employees. He has been blamed by former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> for forcing the 1986 sale of the troubled carrier to Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. On April 13, <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, appeared with <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> at a news conference aimed at countering a growing image that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> management is harassing employees and running unsafe airlines. `` The intransigence and unresponsiveness of the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> are the most serious obstacles to a successful conclusion of Eastern's internal restructuring,'' <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> told reporters, citing his own experience of trying to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> leadership. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> responded: `` I would be delighted to sit down with <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and have an open discussion with the whole world watching. He can bring <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> along. I do n't think he'll ever have the courage to do that. He could n't deal with reality and the facts.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which teetered near bankruptcy, chilled many employees. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has become a bogeyman for airline unions, a reputation solidified in 1983 when he took his <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy reorganization. He voided contracts, slashed salaries, laid off a third of the work force and got the carrier flying again despite a pilots' strike. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, 55, sent <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> a congratulatory telegram after he took over <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and asked for a meeting. He never got a response, he said. Instead, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and flight attendants union head <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> lost their seats on the board of directors. He later received a letter threatening to fire him for meeting with union members on company property. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> had frequent meetings with <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> during the former astronaut's 15 years at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, but he says he's never heard a word from <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and has gotten no more than `` a cold-fish handshake'' from Bakes. His letters to top executives, he says, are invariably answered by staffers. `` They've tried to diminish me to the lowest common denominator,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` But if there's anything that's driven our union together, it's the way they've tried to discredit me personally.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> believes management, after failing to extract cuts of up to 50 percent in salaries for baggage handlers and other non-mechanics in his union, wanted to force a strike, keep the carrier flying with replacement workers and crush the union. He claims rising numbers of firings and grievances have been designed to `` provoke a wildcat strike so they can fire everybody.'' `` But everyone has been beautiful in following our philosophy, our direction to keep doing a good job and not react to the harsh treatment,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, re-elected last year with 82 percent of the vote. The machinists have been working since Dec. 31, 1987, under their old contract while they meet with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> under the supervision of a federal mediator. Pay and work rules are the two main issues in the bargaining. There's been more to the machinists' effort than passive resistance. The union has attorneys in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> keeping up with myriad lawsuits, including a recent machinists' suit that charged management with trying to dismantle <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and violating security and federal labor laws, and asked a judge to reverse <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s takeover. Last year, the machinists won a federal ruling preventing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> from having an outside company take over some ground service work, and in March, another ruling blocked the announced spin-off of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle into a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. And persistent charges by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and machinists were blamed by management for the current <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> safety inspections of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and for the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s unusual study of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to run airlines `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has run into a smart cookie,'' said <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> after losing a re-election bid in the flight attendants union. `` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> is not a wild man _ he's a very deliberate, intelligent, motivated man who has been carefully portrayed otherwise by corporations fearful of his populist appeal.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, a divorced father of three who says he last vacationed 10 years ago, is dedicating his 70-hour weeks _ at $ 63,879 a year _ these days to heading off <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> every place he can. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> says he wants only what's best for his members and the airline, and believes employees should have important influence in their companies. `` A lot of people identify me with <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` But I never believe any of these dreams is impossible.''

<HEAD>Private Relief Agency Negotiating For Permanent Aid Mission To
Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A private relief agency says it is negotiating with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to send the first permanent <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> aid mission to the country since the 1975 defeat of U.S.-backed forces in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. World Vision, a California-based agency with projects in 80 nations, asked leaders in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for permission to open an operation that eventually could funnel up to $ 400,000 worth of assistance to <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vision </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> said in an interview over the weekend. <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> said he was encouraged by some officials' responses during talks in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> two weeks ago, but he cautioned that further discussions were needed with the Vietnamese, whom he called `` tough negotiators.'' Since the fall of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> 13 years ago, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has received an estimated $ 10 million in assistance from private American groups. But because Americans are prohibited from trading with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, humanitarian shipments must be specially licensed by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. So far, the shipments have been small supplies of food and medical equipment arranged by delegations that visit the country for a few days. World Vision, for example, expects to ship $ 40,000 worth of resins, leather and other raw materials for prosthetic devices for the estimated 60,000 amputees in the country. <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> said his agency could do much more if it had a presence in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` They're reluctant to have anybody -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relief workers -RRB- in the country permanently,'' <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> said. `` The stance is ` you give us the money and we'll do the work.''' Unless that attitude changes however, the relief shipments will remain small, though <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> needs massive assistance because of its moribund economy, <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> won the war but is losing the peace,'' he said. World Vision would like to provide up to $ 400,000 in aid to the 1.6 million people in <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION>, a particularly deprived province in central <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the site of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operations during the war. <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> himself was based there as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilot flying combat missions during the war. `` It may not sound like a lot of money in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar goes very, very far in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s economy,'' <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> said. The mission, staffed by at least one World Vision worker, would assist the Vietnamese to improve health care, farming, literacy and water quality. The region is also hard hit by polio, which thrives in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> because vaccination programs are limited. The <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a consortium of European private agencies also want to establish a regular presence in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Indochina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> group that follows Vietnamese affairs. Besides Vietnamese approval for permanent missions, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> groups would need the usual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government licenses. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials also have noted that a permanent office in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> might require special waivers of laws against U.S.-Vietnamese monetary exchange transactions. Humanitarian assistance received a limited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government endorsement in late 1986, when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed to make its best effort to account for the estimated 1,770 Americans still listed as missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since the war. In return, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said it would encourage private humanitarian efforts. Since the agreement, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has turned over more than two dozen remains of missing servicemen, and private relief groups have sent raw materials for the production of artificial limbs. Still, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said it will be cool to further enhancement of the relationship as long as the Vietnamese continue their occupation of neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Administration officials have also said publicly they believe the Vietnamese are withholding information about missing American servicemen. The administration has been especially critical of a proposal by several senators that the two countries open diplomatic missions in each others' capitals along the lines of the `` interest sections'' the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have. <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> and other humanitarian aid workers support the proposal. `` It would be a positive step,'' <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't fight a match outside the ring. Not only would it help in the humanitarian efforts, it would probably help resolve the issue of the missing.'' `` The war is over for both sides, now is the time for peace, for reconciliation, for healing,'' <PERSON> Seiple </PERSON> said.

 Taiwanese warships fired at two Chinese fishing vessels trading illegally with Taiwanese in separate incidents, an official report from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said. Five fishermen were reported injured. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in a report appearing in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> on Saturday that a fishing boat from <LOCATION> Pingtan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in coastal <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province was chased by three navy ships near <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s northern port of <LOCATION> Keelung </LOCATION> on April 16 The warships fired from about 200 yards away, and three Chinese fishermen were injured, the report said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he would issue a fast veto of the trade bill and urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass one that `` will assist, not impede, our dynamic economy.'' In a weekly radio address delivered from the Oval Office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his objections to the bill `` range from rules on plant closing notifications to restrictions on exports.'' `` You can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto, but fast,'' the president said, adding that he would then propose an alternative measure.

 The 1,000-page bill, fashioned over three years of congressional debate, won 63-36 approval Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ three votes short of the margin needed to overturn a presidential veto. Because of the measure's length, clerical work and printing are expected to delay its delivery to the president until midweek at the earliest. The bill would overhaul the nation's system for imposing import curbs to retaliate against international trade violations and aid American industries threatened by stepped-up foreign competition. An section added to the bill requires all but the smallest employers to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. There are exceptions for companies that find themselves in serious financial trouble. The administration opposes the provision, saying it does not belong in the trade bill and would cramp <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth and encourage companies to locate elsewhere by adding new federal regulation. Supporters argue that the idea is humane and decent. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a senior administration official said Friday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto message is expected to cover at least plant closings and the bill's curbs on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil exports. `` It wo n't be a laundry list of items but we want to give <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> a clear idea of what the president will accept in a second bill,'' the official said. He said Cabinet officers were being consulted about their objections.

 The deaths of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter pilots raises to 46 the number of Americans killed during the past year in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region. The figure includes 37 who died in an Iraqi missile strike on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate Stark on May 17, 1987. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the attack was a mistake. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has 17 ships in the gulf, including six mine sweepers, and 10 others in nearby waters. The effort, prompted by attacks on merchant vessels during the 7 -LCB- - year war between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, costs $ 1 million a day The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday that the two crewmen aboard a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship had been officially declared killed in action. They had been listed as missing since April 18. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> announcement said the crew reported an enemy radar locked on their helicopter before it disappeared. However, the statement did not say the craft was shot down by Iranian forces, as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed. Its crew was identified as Capt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and Capt. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Their helicopter disappeared when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attacked and destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for Iranian mining of gulf waters and firing at American helicopters. When <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> countered later that day, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces sunk or disabled six Iranian vessels. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 44 Iranian sailors were killed. It also claimed 15 U.S. Marines were wounded, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesmen denied. The helicopter, which took part in the attack on one of the Iranian oil platforms earlier in the day, vanished during a nighttime mission off the guided missile cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> a few hours after the fighting ended. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed it had shot down the helicopter and recovered the wreckage. However, none was publicly displayed. Seven other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deaths in the region came as a result of flying accidents.

<TEXT>
 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday from the White House: This week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, trade was the talk of the town, and important talk it was. I've often mentioned trade issues in these broadcasts, and with your help during these last few years, we've been able to resist attempts to block free and fair trade It has n't been easy, because not a few politicians still think the way to re-election is to portray themselves as the great friend of the American worker by pushing protectionism. It's been up to us to point out that over the long run, this approach halts growth and costs jobs. But, as I say, with your help, this message has gotten through. Believe me, this ability to resist protectionism along with our commitment to lower taxes, less spending and fewer regulations, has made a huge difference in all of our lives. I do n't think any of us can easily forget that sense of desperation Americans felt a few years ago as they saw inflation driving the weekly grocery bill up and up, the value of their savings shrinking, jobs growing increasingly scarce and economic growth going down to virtually nothing. Well, all that's been changed around. Just this week <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the head of my <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> went down to the White House briefing room to deliver his quarterly report on the state of the economy. Some experts who had noted we're in the 65th month of our economic expansion were saying a slowdown was inevitable, and others, nothing last October's stock market plunge made dire predictions about what the economy was going to do in the first quarter of this year. But the results were exactly what we had hoped for, and, in fact, what we had predicted. The economy is moving along at a moderate rate of growth, and inflation is well under control. My fellow Americans, I remember only too well working in 1981 on my first televised speech describing the `` worst economic mess since the Great Depression,'' and wondering even then how long it would take us to repair the damage. Well, thanks to the dynamics of less government and more free markets, the damage has been repaired and repaired much faster than anyone could have originally hoped. That's why I'm certain you do n't want me or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> taking any risks with this progress. And that's also why I've made it clear that I'm going to be very severe with any trade legislation coming out of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that threatens <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prosperity. For the last year, we've all been working on a trade bill here, one that initially contained many objectionable provisions. Working with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, we managed to remove almost all of these bad provisions. Unfortunately, however, when it comes to safeguarding prosperity, `` almost'' _ well, `` almost'' can never be good enough. The current legislation, despite all the hard work, still has provisions that threaten economic growth. These provisions are comprised mainly of demands for unecessary, burdensome and costly regulation of private industry. Provisions range from rules on plant closing notifications to restrictions on exports. Unfortunately, these provisions serve the special interests and not the nation's interest. They would reduce the flexibility of our economy and render us less able to respond to the realities of the international marketplace. In short, they would make us less competitive, not more. This bill did pass the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week. But the good news is, the vote showed we have the strength to sustain a presidential veto. And you can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto, but fast. And then, all <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has to do is drop the ruffles, frills and flourishes put there for the special interests, and we can have a trade bill and have it soon. As I've stated repeatedly, I want a trade bill and we'll work vigorously to secure one. I urge the congressional leadership to schedule prompt action on a bill immediately after my veto is sustained. It is time to set aside the special interests and advance <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interest by passing trade legislation that will assist, not impede, our dynamic economy. In the meantime, I'm delighted to tell you that there was some good news on trade this week. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was in town and we discussed our two nations' pending agreement on a historic free trade zone between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. This is the kind of trade legislation we need; legislation that promotes growth and prosperity and keeps <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> away from the protectionism that once cost the world and our country so much. Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> today issued an emergency order barring older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s like the jetliner that ripped open over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> from flying higher than 23,000 feet if they have had more than 55,000 landings. The order is in effect until the affected airlines conduct complete visual inspections of the jets' first class cabin structure, which is the area that opened at 24,000 feet in the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrar </PERSON> said the order would affect 66 planes in the 737-100 and 737-200 series. The jets are in the fleets of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> and American airlines, he said. He said that at altitudes of 23,000 feet the pressure between the outside and inside of the aircraft is such that a structural weakness would not cause a failure or damage to the plane. The order, issued as an airworthiness directive by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, is effective immediately, <PERSON> Ferrar </PERSON> said. Airlines must complete inspections of the aircraft over the next 500 landings. Last October 5, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered close inspection of the upper skin of the early model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s because routine inspections had turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap, officials said Friday. The agency warned the problem could cause rapid cabin decompression, they said. The inspections also found metal strips on the fuselage coming loose on some early-model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s because the lamination was no longer holding. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> the company has issued service bulletins on the need for periodic inspections for possible cracking or structural weakening because of corrosion of the skin of the older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s. <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> said the company's most recent bulletin had been issued two weeks before Thursday's incident in which a huge upper section of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 jet tore away, leaving passengers exposed to the open skies at 24,000 feet and forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing within 15 minutes. A flight attendant was swept out of the plane to her death and 61 passengers were injured in the incident. The <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet involved in the incident was among the early 737 models subject to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive as well as to the series of service bulletins by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> outlining the inspection programs, officials said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive required operators of older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s to inspect the extreme upper sections of the planes' outer skin from just behind the front entry door to the tail section for cracks and metal strips that might be coming loose and `` could result in rapid depressurization of the airplane.'' The directive covered the first 291 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s manufactured, of which the Aloha plane was No. 152, according to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators have not determined the cause of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident, but sources who asked not to be identified said that investigators are focusing on a possible structural failure that could have caused a rapid depressurization of the aircraft cabin. However, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, manager of public relations for <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, said: `` We are in full compliance with the October directive. We did receive the directive, the inspections were carried out and we are in compliance.'' She would not elaborate on what the inspections revealed, but said nothing was found that caused alarm. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records show that twice in 1983 and several other times since then there has been extensive repair work to mend cracks and corroded metal in the lower half of the Aloha plane. This seemed not to be related to Thursday's incident.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> finished last in all nine triathlons he entered last year, but he says he was the winner. Just living is a victory for the 49-year-old heart-transplant recipient. `` I used to live for the bonus check at the end of each month,'' said the former <LOCATION> Tuscon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, insurance executive who will compete here Sunday in a triathlon. `` Now, the way I look at it, every day is a bonus check. `` I'm not out there to win any race. But I feel that every race I'm in I win,'' he said. As a successful executive, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> worked 16 hours a day, smoked heavily and never exercised. But that changed when he received a heart transplant in 1985 after a yearlong bout with heart disease. He started walking, and four months later entered a five-kilometer walkathon. Six weeks after that, he entered a 10-kilometer race, walking much of the way and finishing dead last. Triathlons _ races that combine running, swimming and bicycling _ were his next step. He started training and in April 1986 entered one in <LOCATION> Tuscon </LOCATION>. `` People were saying, ` Hurry up, hurry up!' and I was like ` I'm moving That's fast enough.' I was like the clown in the rodeo,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. As he trained for the Sunday event, he recalled a race in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> last year. While awaiting the start, he spotted <PERSON> Herschel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Tweed </PERSON>, parents of the teen-ager whose heart he received. `` I walked over and they all gave me a hug,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` Then just before the race they were yelling, ` Go get'em, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>!' I was actually crying, standing there before the start of the race.''

<HEAD>Reagan Says He Will Give Quick Veto to Trade Bill</HEAD>

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Saturday that he plans to quickly veto the trade legislation passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and that the politically touchy issue of plant closing notification will not be the only reason for his action. `` You can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto but fast,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office. The president said `` almost all'' of the provisions the administration originally objected to had been removed from the bill during negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately, however when it comes to safeguarding prosperity, almost can never be good enough.'' `` The current legislation, despite all the hard work, still has provisions that threaten economic growth,'' the president said. `` These provisions are comprised mainly of demands for unnecessary, burdensome and costly regulation of private industry.'' `` The provisions range from rules on plant closing notifications to restrictions on exports.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto could come as early as midweek, and he indicated Saturday that he expects his veto to be sustained. Although the measure won approval by a wide margin in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 63-36 vote was three votes short of the margin needed to overturn a veto `` I urge the congressional leadership to schedule prompt action on a bill immediately after my veto is sustained,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` It is time to set aside the special interests and advance <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interests by passing trade legislation that will assist, not impede, our dynamic economy.'' The plant-closings feature requires all but the smallest employers to provide 60-day notice of closings and large-scale layoffs. There are exceptions for companies that find themselves in serious financial trouble. The administration opposes the provision, saying it would cramp <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth and encourage companies to locate elsewhere by adding new federal regulation. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, delivering the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to the president's speech, said, `` It merely calls for a measure of common courtesy on the part of those companies that can afford it.'' `` One-third of all workers get no notice; they're told to pick up their pay checks and leave,'' <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. `` Two-thirds of all workers get less than two weeks' notice. They may have put in 20 years of service and have two kids in college, but they're out on the street _ just like that.'' The president's comments came after one of his strongest supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> expressed qualms about focusing on the plant closing provision in a presidential veto message. `` Frankly, some of us think there ought to be a stronger reason,'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, told reporters. Blaming the veto on the plant-closings provision, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters Thursday, `` puts Republicans on the side, at least the perception out there, of being against the poor working men and women who get only four-day notice.'' He expressed doubt, when pressed, however, that the issue would be much of a headache on the campaign trail this fall. The provision's supporters are just as sure that it will. `` It certainly gives the Democrats a huge issue for the fall ...,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. `` There are n't going to be many factory workers who think it is unfair for them to get 60-day notice before they get put out to pasture. `` There are polls out there,'' says Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people feel that it is entirely reasonable and sound. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was the most candid among administration supporters. But several <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional staffers said there was growing concern over the issue. The main provisions of the trade bill would overhaul the nation's system for imposing import curbs to retaliate against international trade violations and aid American industries threatened by stepped-up foreign competition.

 A set of remaining `` loose ends'' is casting a shadow on prospects for ratification of the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty in time for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s summit trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The four snags cited by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, include a U.S.-Soviet disagreement about the meaning of provisions designed to assure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against Soviet He and the other leaders say they are optimistic all the difficulties will be resolved, but they have firmly declared their opposition to rushing the ratification proceedings just so the work will be finished by the May 29-June 2 summit. `` This is not a delay,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` This is an effort to do this thoroughly.'' Since last December, when the superpowers signed the pact eliminating ground-based missiles with ranges between 315 and 3,125 miles, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has hailed the verification and monitoring provisions as unprecedented sets of safeguards against Soviet non-compliance. Having steered the pact through committee hearings, the administration is now eager for approval by the whole <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in time for a formal exchange of ratification documents between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the summit. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told a news conference on Friday he would open the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate on May 11, if the four obstacles are overcome. Joining <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> in the decision were the chairmen of two other important <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees: <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, of Foreign Relations and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, who called the stumbling blocks `` important loose ends. The newest of the four problems identified by <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> is a disagreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over the things inspectors of missile facilities will be permitted to see and where they may go to see them. According to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Soviet experts believe the treaty permits inspection of weapons containers big enough to contain entire missiles. They also want to put off-limits some areas of three of their 133 facilities covered by the agreement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the treaty permits inspection of smaller containers as well, to see if they contain individual missile stages, and does not permit the Soviets to place the selected areas off limits. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said higher level officials had become involved in the dispute, which originally was raised on a technical level, and he said he was optimistic the problems would be resolved. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said: `` I believe the problems can be reconciled but I believe the Soviets should understand this is not a good way to start out by challenging some clear provisions of the treaty. `` It is enormously important that we go into this treaty with good faith on both sides. We do not need any cloud of bad faith hanging over us.'' The second snag, the senators said, was the need to get clarification from the Soviets, in writing, that the ban on intermediate range-missiles now in the superpower arsenal will prevent both sides from developing futuristic versions of these weapons. In settling this dispute, the two countries would presumably need to define more precisely what is, in fact, a `` weapons delivery system.'' The fear is that arms builders could devise a weapon they do not define as a missile but has the capabilities that today's missiles have. Third, the senators are seeking assurances that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the capability to verify the ban on futuristic weapons. And finally, they want a commitment from the administration that it is moving adequately and with enough money to upgrade satellite surveillance systems that help monitor the accord. `` If these differences can be resolved, I do n't see any reason why we ca n't approve ratification,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Election Year Brings Push for Anti-Drug Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's an election year, and Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are putting a high priority on anti-drug legislation. But their major problem is how to fund the battle. `` Both political parties are going to be scrambling to pose as Mr. <PERSON> Drug </PERSON> <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> for the next six months,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on foreign operations. `` There's a tendency to pose for holy pictures in election years on drugs, and then forget about the blasted issue next time ` round,'' complained Obey, D-Wis The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has struck first, going on record earlier this month 93-0 in favor of bypassing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' spending-cut promises to allow $ 2.6 billion in new drug programs. Indications are that the envisioned drug bill will be timed to hit the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor in September for maximum election impact. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to stay within current overall spending guidelines. But its Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders have each ordered up their own drug bills, with public release expected in the next few weeks. `` We're hoping Republicans and Democrats will join together and we'll have a bipartisan drug bill,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, chairman of the Republicans' task force, agreed. But containing the cost will make it tough, he said. `` There will be, for anyone, a very limited amount of resources,'' he said. `` They are going to be meager compared to all the ideas there are to spend them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, introduced by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, would provide big budget increases for federal law enforcement agencies and grants to local police About a fourth of the money would go toward efforts to reduce demand in this country through treatment centers and drug education. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bills will carry those options and more. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has asked committee chairmen to come up with a comprehensive package. It will almost surely be more expensive than whatever the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans propose, especially in aid to local governments and police. Liberals on Friday were looking at cutting military spending to pay for it. An amendment was being considered for the Pentagon bill now before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would cut funding for the Star Wars missile defense system and transfer it to the anti-drug-import efforts. Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the third-ranking Democrat, acknowledged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration might consider that funding strategy as backing away from <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending agreements made last fall But, he said, `` The public has their priorities the same as we do.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> select narcotics committee, would like to also include money to fight AIDS among drug users, and would support expanded use of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military to help other nations control their drug production, according to spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>. `` One thing we do n't want is the death penalty,'' he said, or penalties on users that would overload prisons. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>'s proposal would be about the same cost as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> plan. Republicans are looking at stiffer penalties for drug offenders, including capital punishment for dealers involved in deaths and proposals to cut demand with emphasis on what they call `` user accountability.'' What form that will take is still unclear, as jail terms must be weighed against problems of prison overcrowding. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers, who two years ago opposed creation of a drug `` czar'' to coordinate federal efforts, may now favor one. They were also examining drug testing and related proposals to force anti-drug action by local governments and businesses that get federal money. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are expressing impatience with the cooperation of other countries. The Senate has voted overwhelmingly to impose sanctions against <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for not doing its share to help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fight the flow of drugs across the border. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has recommended similar action against <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. Neither of those pieces of legislation is expected to reach the president's desk. But with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at stake this year some sort of drug legislation including international enforcement is expected to emerge before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> quits in October for the campaign trail. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, told Obey's subcommittee the administration was expecting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take action on drugs before the election. `` Drugs ... is a cyclical issue,'' she told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> appropriations subcommittee, `` When the drug bill is on the floor, we're going to have an orgy of amendments of people out-narcing each other.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, who is helping to draft the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> proposal, agreed. `` It's very clear that in the months ahead <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be right in the middle of this business,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Traficant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needed to take drastic action, including the death penalty for dealers and use of the military. `` Too many politicians make hay with drugs around here, and the drug dealers just keep making money,'' he said.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration Saturday relaxed its order prohibiting Americans from paying debts in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, opening the way for many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers to clear up bills for water, power and other essential services. On April 8, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> barred any direct or indirect payments by Americans to the regime headed by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The order, which included <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations, also blocked all Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Subsequently, electrical power and other services were cut off at the homes of some Americans, including embassy workers, who were prohibited from paying their bills. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Saturday specified that Americans may now make payments for electricity, water, and similar municipal services, and for communications including telephones and telegrams. Also allowed will be travel-related payments, including departure fees and ticket taxes, landing fees and fuel taxes. Individuals who have paid into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s social security system, which includes health care, may continue to do so, but payments of the country's income tax remain on the prohibited list. The payment of sales and excise taxes will now be allowed. The new rules continue to require that payments for other obligations be made into a specially designated account at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, to be held `` for the benefit of the Panamanian people.'' Those payments include corporate and individual income taxes, port fees, import duties and corporate social security assessments.

 A fist-sized bundle of fluff named <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled meals of minced mice today. `` Everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the chick,'' said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park. `` But the first 10 days are critical, for anybody, human or animal.'' The chick ate its first meal about 6 a.m. and took subsequent meals from the fingertips of a keeper, Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The food was minced baby mice and chicken egg yoke, she said. The meals fed to the chick, which is about the size of a man's fist, amounted to about two tablespoons of food Keepers using tweezers and gloved fingertips helped the baby bird break free of its shell at 5:38 p.m. PDT Friday ending a 61 -LCB- - hour hatching process that began when the first crack appeared in the chick's shell Wednesday <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON> is an Indian word for condor, chosen by an intertribal council of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tribes, Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. The squawking chick was swaddled in a towel and placed in the same type of isolette used for premature infants. The dull yellow-colored chick with its bald, peaked head, was reportedly resting comfortably. `` Early this morning there were 27 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors left in the world,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Toone </PERSON>, the park's curator of birds, said at the news conference Friday. `` This afternoon there's 28 of them, and we could n't be more excited about that. `` When the numbers are so low, one bird is seen as a very big step away from extinction,'' he added. The chick was conceived by the only known active breeding pair of the nearly extinct <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest land bird. Efforts to save the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor, which has a wingspan of up to 10 feet at maturity, rest with the captive breeding program. The last known <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor in the wild was captured a year ago. The chick, whose sex wo n't be determined for about a month, will grow up not knowing its mother or father. It will be raised in captivity with the help of hand puppets that resemble condors. The puppets are used to feed the chick. Officials decided to intervene in the hatching process Friday and give the chick a delicate boost after it became mired inside its shell. The bird had become stuck in a kind of `` glue'' composed of dried membrane and albumen and could n't rotate in the shell to peck its way out, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. Biologist <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON> checked the egg every two hours Friday before determining the chick was ready to be assisted from the shell. <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON> could n't intervene prematurely because of the danger of rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes, possibly triggering fatal bleeding at the point of the rupture, <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. When it was certain that the chick's external circulation ceased, <PERSON> Kuehler </PERSON> could begin to pull away bits of the blue-green eggshell using her gloved fingers. Tweezers were used to peel back the shell membrane. The gradual, complicated process took seven hours until there was room to lift the bird out. The avocado-sized egg, about 5 inches long, had been under a 24-hour watch since 4 a.m. Wednesday, when keepers noticed cracks in one end. The `` pip'' cracks signaled the start of a hatching process that took nearly three days. After the egg was laid March 3, it was taken away from the parent birds and incubated artificially in hopes that the female bird would produce a second egg. But so far, this has not happened.

 Authorities arrested more than 1,000 people and seized hundreds of weapons in a 48-hour nationwide crackdown on small-time drug pushers and criminals, police said Saturday. It was the fourth such police operation since early last year, when the government of Socialist Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> decided to stiffen penalties for drug dealers and try to eliminate drug-peddling areas in the country's major cities. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has become a major point of entry into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for Latin American cocaine and <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> heroin, international drug enforcement officials say. Authorities said they arrested 1,038 suspects in the raids and seized three pounds each of heroin and cocaine, 275 pounds of hashish and 1,500 pills of hallucinogenic drugs. Officers also confiscated 35 guns, 479 knives and nearly $ 270,000.

 Here is the text of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response given Saturday by Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radio address: President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ought to sign the trade bill He will make a foolish mistake if he vetoes the bill. It will be a foolish mistake because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is on the threshold of a new economic era. To preserve our standard of living in the 1990s, we must do better, much better, in the game of global trade. The American people understand this. That's why the trade bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by a large bipartisan majority. The bill recognizes that we need to do two things above all: we must launch an export campaign unprecedented in our history; and we must improve our productivity. The bill plots a strategy for increasing exports. First, it liberates firms from the red tape of unduly tight export controls. Second, it boosts export promotion efforts to benefit American companies. Third, it blows the whistle on unequal and unfair trade. Many countries have gotten rich off of free access to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market while protecting their home markets. These countries can now afford to eliminate their trade barriers. The bill requires them to live up to their international obligations _ pure and simple. We seek a level playing field. But it takes more than a level playing field to compete. You've got to have skilled employees And a sure way to boost labor productivity is to strengthen education and training. The trade bill would entitle all workers who lose their jobs to imports to training or remedial education. It provides nearly a billion dollars for the readjustment of other workers. And it renews the nation's commitment to math, science, foreign language and vocational education. In addition, the bill requires large, financially sound companies to give their employees and communities 60 days notice of plant closings or mass layoffs. It merely calls for a measure of common courtesy on the part of those companies that can afford it. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> get 60 days notice when they lose their job; so does the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Why should n't ordinary citizens? Even President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s own task force and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> say that advance notice is good business practice. The president objects because he believes this is a matter for the private sector, not the government, to decide. Well, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the private sector has had every opportunity to take care of this problem on its own terms; it has failed. One-third of all workers get no notice; they're told to pick up their paychecks and leave. Two-thirds of all workers get less than two weeks' notice. They may have put in 20 years of service and have two kids in college, but they're out of the street _ just like that. Years ago, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people decided that it makes sense to ease the social and economic costs of unrestrained free enterprise. We enacted child labor, minimum wage and antitrust laws. The plant closing provision is squarely in this tradition. Critics say the provision has nothing to do with competitveness. They're wrong. If a worker had advance notice of a layoff, he has time to make arrangements for retraining before the clock starts ticking on his unemployment insurance. Reducing the period of unemployment; facilitating retraining; that is what improving labor productivity is all about. Today, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs a workforce that is flexible and adaptable, able to shift rapidly to changing economic conditions. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have already figured this out; they have advance-notice requirements. To oppose this provision is to resist an effort to move this country into the 1990s. It is tragic that the president is threatening to kill the entire bipartisan trade bill on account of this one provision. In truth, his opposition is really based on symbolism; he fears a symbolic victory for labor. Is mere symbolism worth the price of needlessly unemployed people and depressed communities? Is it worth the price of another several years without a coherent foreign economic policy? Is it worth killing a bipartisan bill which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spent three years on? Common sense says no. Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, the country is ready for the 1990s. For the sake of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, sign the trade bill.

 A fire Saturday blackened a 27-story building that houses the government radio and television stations, and 40 people were overcome by smoke, government and hospital officials said. Officials said the fire was caused by an electrical short circuit. Employees in the building said they smelled wires burning. Smoke billowed from windows on the eighth floor, where the fire started, and several floors above and below. Witnesses said they saw 20 fire engines and about a dozen ambulances at the scene. Firefighters used ladders to rescue people trapped on the stricken floors. Some were overcome by smoke. An official at the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Boulac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> near the radio-TV building said 20 people were brought there for treatment of smoke inhalation. Seventeen were treated and discharged, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, and the other three were `` under observation but in good condition.'' Police sources said another 20 people overcome by smoke were taken to another hospital, treated and discharged. The fire briefly interrupted transmissions on the two television channels that broadcast during the day. <PERSON> Samira </PERSON> <PERSON> Mounir </PERSON>, an actress who was in a recording studio in the building, said: `` The smoke was so thick we could n't see each other. We just groped our way out.'' The 28-year-old building houses about 6,000 radio and television employees and the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that controls them. It was not known how many people were inside the building when the fire broke out. Many rushed from their offices and studios to escape the smoke and crowded onto the tree-lined street, paralyzing traffic for more than a half a mile in both directions.

 About 15,000 gay rights supporters marched Saturday to protest a new anti-homosexuality law that they say will allow censorship of the arts. The demonstrators gathered from all over the country and streamed through central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a rally against the government bill, which becomes law on June 1. Actress <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitken </PERSON> said she supported the protest because she is worried that the law will result in censorship of works by homosexuals. The government measure is a blanket stipulation stating that local authorities must not `` intentionally promote homosexuality.'' The government has accused some left-wing local authorities of using state funds to promote homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. Opponents say wording of the measure is so broad that it can be used to censor artistic works, particularly books and plays by or about homosexuals. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> joined Saturday's march. A British legislator and two Italian lawmakers also took part in the protest.

 The decision to widen the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military role in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> could make the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the policeman of the waterway, despite its aversion to the task, gulf shipping officials said Saturday. The shipping community generally welcomed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to expand its protection of foreign vessels from attacks by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> But some shippers also complained that the new policy does not go far enough. `` The best attitude to adopt now is a wait-and-see one,'' said a shipping executive who has complained that his vessels, mainly flying <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> flags, were left at the mercy of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as the big powers protected their own shipping. `` From what has been annnounced, protection has not been guaranteed for all ships,'' he said. `` It sounds like an elastic policy that will be used by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the right moment, when they choose to take on the Iranians.'' Under the policy announced Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces will go to the aid of non-communist, neutral ships that ask for help after being fired upon. Previously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships protected only those ships reflagged with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags or registered as U.S.-flagged vessels, including 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> escorts through the gulf, however, frequently have picked up `` hitchhiker'' vessels that are not <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flagged. `` In effect, -LRB- the new policy -RRB- could turn out to be a substitute for the proposal to have a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval task force protect shipping in the gulf until the Iraq-Iran war ends,'' said another gulf shipping executive. `` And despite statements by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to find itself becoming the policeman in the waterway.'' He was referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s comment that despite the policy change, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not the `` policemen of the gulf, nor do we wish to be. Said another executive: `` I think the Americans are taking on a tremendous load ... doing the job the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to do.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run radio said Saturday that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s decision proved the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was backing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war The radio said that by protecting neutral vessels, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be `` seeking to limit the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s retaliatory powers. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> strikes on Iranian oil installations and tankers. In the past year, 46 Americans have been killed in or near the gulf, including two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilots who disappeared with their aircraft April 18 after reporting hostile radar locked on their helicopter. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed the aircraft was shot down. The biggest loss of American life occurred May 17 in an accidental Iraqi missile strike on the frigate Stark. Thirty-seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors died. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has sought a multinational naval escort force in the gulf under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag. Less than 10 percent of the ships sailing gulf waters fly communist-bloc flags The gulf supplies nearly 20 percent of the non-communist world's petroleum and is the major trading route for the coastal states that depend on imports for most of their food and commodity supplies The spread of hostilities into the gulf from the Iraq-Iran war has harmed port trade and tended to reduce ship traffic in the waterway. Still, an average of 20 tankers and freighters a day make their way in and out of the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the entry to the gulf. On Saturday, the 27th convoy this year of reflagged Kuwaiti ships headed out of the gulf escorted by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, British, French, Italian and Soviet warships escorting their commercial vessels became routine last year when the Iranians stepped up their attacks on commercial shipping with gunboat attacks and the laying of mines. None of the shipping executives who commented on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy change would be quoted by name. Many of the officials do business with both <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Some shipping executives said they believed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would find ways to continue menacing ships despite the expanded <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> role. `` Who's to prevent the Iranians sowing hundreds of mines in the waterway? They manufacture them,'' said one. `` Who's to prevent them firing Silkworm anti-ship missiles at a convoy moving through the Hormuz? `` They will be ready to take in stride the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> taking on all their missile batteries there. In the end, it's the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that will be the loser, finding itself in a state of war.''

 Maoist guerrillas hanged three peasant women in the highlands after accusing them of washing soldiers' clothes and selling food to the soldiers, police said Saturday Elsewhere, an armed cadre of the Tupac <ORGANIZATION> Amaru </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Cuba rebel group, seized a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> bus late Friday on a downtown street, ordered passengers off, exploded firebombs and burned the bus, police said. A column of Shining Path guerrillas dragged the three peasant women from their home in an isolated farming settlement before dawn Friday and strung them up on a nearby tree, police said. `` We hanged them like dogs for collaborating with dogs,'' witnesses quoted one of the guerrillas as saying. The women, aged 60, 50 and 25, lived together in <LOCATION> Ruguyoc </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of the state capital, <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, which is 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The fanatical Shining Path frequently has shot or stabbed to death peasants in reprisal for aid the campesinos provide to the military. The government says more than 10,000 people, mainly highland peasants, have been killed during the Shining Path's eight-year insurgency to install a worker-peasant state. The Tupac Amaru group has been active, mainly in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, since 1984. The group is smaller and considered much less violent that the Shining Path.

 Police combed streets and detained an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> and Iranian after a warning that Palestinian terrorists were planning to bomb a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base, officials said Saturday. Authorities also picked up an off-duty American soldier and an Australian tourist whose beards led authorities to mistake them for Palestinians. Both men were released after an identity check, the officials said. The roundups came Friday and Saturday after <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials said they received a warning that Palestinians planned to bomb <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and bars frequented by American servicemen during the weekend. Police told reporters they received a report from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service Mossad that the bombings were to be carried out by at least eight Palestinians. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli embassies in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> said they had no knowledge of such a warning.

Officials at <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> could not be contacted for comment.

In October, American authorities stepped up security at <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and four smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations after communist rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino near <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Also Saturday, in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, 50 miles to south of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> cautioned the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government against ending the lease on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases. In a speech to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Filipino war veterans, <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> asked, `` Does the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> wish the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to continue to share the burden of <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> defense?'' <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> said that in exchange for the bases, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> guarantees the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' defense against external aggression. He said the arrangement enables the 160,000-member Filipino army to concentrate on fighting the country's 20-year communist insurgency. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> officials began early this month to review the 1947 agreement under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> operates military bases in the country.

 A French patrol boat opened fire on Melanesian separatists Saturday in the navy's first direct role in violence that has left seven people dead on this island territory. Twenty-one French police officers were still held hostage in caves on the New Caledonian island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION>. An opposition spokesman demanded that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> agree to a referendum on independence. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the main separatist movement accused the French government of waging a `` colonial war'' against the native Melanesians. About 25 military policemen traded gunfire with about 30 armed rebels near a guerrilla encampment at <LOCATION> Pouebo </LOCATION>, a village on the island's east coast, said <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Berges </PERSON>, chief of staff at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> office here. A patrol boat just off the coast fired submachine guns at the insurgents, he said. No injuries were reported on either side. But the exchange was indicative of the rapidly escalating proportions of the conflict. Asked if the insurgency had reached civil war stage, <PERSON> Berges </PERSON> said: `` It's beginning to look that way.'' The main separatist group, the <ORGANIZATION> Kanak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that the navy detroyed a fishermen's cooperative in <LOCATION> Pouebo </LOCATION>. It charged that the French army was stepping up its operations throughout the territory. `` Faced with this situation of colonial war, the <LOCATION> Kanak </LOCATION> people are organizing to thwart the occupation forces,'' the statement said. Front spokesman <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON> said Saturday that the group wants a mediator appointed to negotiate terms of an island-wide referendum on self-rule. He said a mediator must be named before the insurgents will respond to President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s appeal for the immediate release of the hostages. The violence began April 22 when separatists tried to block French presidential elections scheduled on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> on April 24. Rebels raided a police station, kidnapping 27 gendarmes and killing four others. Twelve hostages were subsequently released. But eight more lawmen were seized Wednesday when they tried to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages. Two of those hostages, the head of an anti-terrorism squad and an assistant prosecutor, were subsequently released and ordered to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists. They were told the remaining hostages would be killed if the two men did not return to the rebel hideout. Because of that threat, the government said it considers the two to still be hostages. The native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the territory's 145,000 people. About 36 percent of the population is <LOCATION> European </LOCATION>, with the rest primarily Asian or Tahitian.

The democratic-style reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are similar to changes unsuccessfully sought by <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an interview with the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> daily Vjesnik. `` I hope <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> succeeds where my father did not, because there is no alternative to changes and perestroika,'' he said. Perestroika, or reconstruction, and glasnost, or openess, are buzzwords for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` My father was the first to ` shake' the Soviet bureaucratic society. He dared to unmask -LRB- Soviet dictator <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, start economic reforms and democratization and urge a dialogue with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on curbing the arms race,'' <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` If my father had not begun then, 33 years ago, it would be more difficult for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> now.'' Excerpts of what was described as <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>'s first interview with a foreign journalist were carried by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> did not say when or where the interview was given or disclose personal details about the younger <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>. His comments came just a few days after a Soviet newspaper, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> News, made similar observations. The report also came as Soviet scholars and writers are trying to come to grips with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s legacy. During <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s almost three decades of rule, millions of Soviets died as a result of purges and crash programs of industrialization and collectivization of agriculture. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> consolidated his power after <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> died in 1953 but was forced out in 1964 by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders, including his ultimate successor, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s treatment of his father was `` inhuman.'' `` My father always behaved correctly toward <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. He brought him to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> -LRB- leaned -RRB- toward those who conspired against <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> said his father was competely isolated after removal from power and when he died, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda mentioned it in a three-line announcement. He said he was working on the publication of his father's memoirs

 Members of the country's main guerrilla movement, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, are reeling from a string of setbacks, including revelations of a spy in their midst and a crackdown on anti-apartheid groups. Three guerrillas face a possible trip to the gallows, one leader was assassinated and a purported informer supposedly photographed secret guerrilla documents and turned them over to the government. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders acknowledge the setbacks and have acknowledged that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s nearly 2-year-old state of emergency has hobbled <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> efforts to undermine white-minority rule. During a recent trip to <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, guerrilla leaders engaged in `` an orgy of self-criticism,'' according to a story last week in The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper. But it said there remained lingering optimism. `` The emergency and the general repression are counterproductive for the regime,'' <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tshwete </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` In terms of heightening resentment and mobilizing mass opinion... the situation is favorable for our activities. But the bad news for the congress includes: _ The March 29 assassination of guerrilla leader <PERSON> Dulcie </PERSON> September in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. _ The April 7 maiming of <PERSON> Albie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, a lawyer and <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member who was seriously injured by a car bomb in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. _ The April 15 death of a guerrilla killed when a mine he was carrying blew up in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, prompting pro-government newspapers to claim the group has stooped to using poorly trained `` kamikaze'' bombers. In February, the government prohibited political activities by major anti-apartheid groups. In addition, three <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members convicted of murder, terror and treason face possible death sentences. In <LOCATION> Messina </LOCATION>, near the northern border with <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mzondileli </PERSON> <PERSON> Nondula </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Mthetheleli </PERSON> <PERSON> Mncube </PERSON>, 28, are expected to be sentenced within the next few days. <PERSON> Nondula </PERSON> was convicted of killing two white women and four children who died in a blast when the truck they were riding in struck a mine. <PERSON> Mncube </PERSON> was convicted of planting a mine that killed a black man in November 1985 and of killing two white policemen during a subsequent escape attempt. In the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Pietermaritzburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, 24, was convicted of carrying out several bombings, including one that killed a police colonel. At another trial of three alleged <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> members charged with terrorism and treason, evidence submitted included secret internal documents, purportedly photographed by a spy, that cited problems faced by the guerrilla movement because of informers and shortages of weapons and funds. Defense witnesses described <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> as a gentle young man who joined the congress in a state of despair over racial discrimination in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the system of apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. Taking the stand to plead for his life, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> professed loyalty to the congress but voiced some disenchantment. Asked what he would do if he could start over again, he replied: `` I would like to be a teacher.'' Formed as a non-violent civil rights group in 1912, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was banned in 1960 and a year later began a bombing and sabotage campaign. Its tactics are repudiated by some moderate blacks, but it is believed capable of winning a national election if restrictions on black voting rights and political activity were lifted.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s international banking center was once a magnet for money from throughout the world, a safe haven for cash that earned the country a reputation as the <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Now, bankers worry that the system may never recover from a nearly two-month shutdown caused by political unrest surrounding the leadership of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Frightened investors have pulled billions of dollars out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Bankers are anxiously studying their options. `` I assume ... -LRB- bankers -RRB- would be thinking about leaving the country because they ca n't do much business right now,'' said <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 93 of the 117 mostly foreign banks operating here. <PERSON> Eiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Motoshige </PERSON>, general manager of the local branch of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s giant <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Each bank is very, very seriously considering what we can do for the immediate future `` The biggest problem,'' he said, `` is that nobody likes to place any funds here ... because of the risk.'' Not long ago, the tiny country attracted money from investors worldwide, many of them drawn by secrecy provisions limiting disclosure of information to foreign courts, governments and other third parties. They also were attracted by the nation's use of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency, its prominent free-trade zone and its location on an isthmus linking Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And, up until June, it offered investors political stability. But a wave of protest against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule has shaken confidence in the system. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, chief of the country's defense forces and the power behind the civilian government, was indicted on drug charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February. He forced the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Feb. 26, one day after <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> tried to fire him. On March 3, the government shut down 67 banks holding licenses to conduct local and international banking business after $ 50 million in Panamanian government money was frozen in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. The subsequent cash shortage prevented the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> from providing the dozen locally owned banks with enough money to cover a run on deposits that began Feb. 26. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, seekng to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster, has imposed sweeping economic sanctions on the country. The administration announced Saturday that it was relaxing some restrictions and would allow Americans to pay utility bills and sales and excise taxes to the government. Payments on corporate and personal income taxes, import duties, port fees and corporate social security payments still are prohibited. Government figures show that assets held by the banking center tumbled from $ 40.3 billion at the end of 1986 to $ 31.4 billion at the end of 1987. `` There was a massive reduction in assets beginning in June,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, Latin American director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` There must have been further shrinkage of assets in the first quarter -LRB- of this year -RRB-,'' he said. <PERSON> Motoshige </PERSON> said, `` So many banks, including ourselves, have had to move our assets outside.'' About three-quarters of the center's assets, or roughly $ 25 billion, were in off-shore activities at the end of last year. Money in off-shore activities _ those that take place outside of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ can be easily moved to competing banking centers in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Analysts have no figures on how much money has left the banking system so far this year. Estimates vary widely from a few billion dollars to more than $ 10 billion. One financial analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, `` They will be lucky if they come out of this with $ 5 billion in off-shore banking.'' Requests for interviews with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a regulatory agency, were ignored. Bankers say that only after the nation's political troubles are settled can the center begin healing. `` There would have to be several changes in the government,'' said <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON>. `` People would have to start getting confidence back in their people handling the government and that could take ... months.'' The banking commission has been trying to ease the situation. On April 18, it allowed the banks to begin accepting deposits from customers. But it restricted the amount of money that could be drawn on the balance in checking accounts. As a result, analysts say, about three-quarters of the newly deposited checks were returned for insufficient funds. In March, the commission allowed banks to resume a dozen additional services, including handling letters of credit, collecting outstanding loans, transferring funds within the country and making foreign exchange transactions. Clients still can not withdraw cash from their accounts, and bankers fear a premature reopening of their institutions would trigger another run. `` People are afraid, and they are just waiting for the banks to open so they can get their money out,'' said <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON>.

 The gawkers began gathering more than an hour before the 9 p.m. start of the first <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> High School Senior Prom in more than a quarter-century. They sat in pickup trucks and cars in the parking lot of the Civic Center; others cruised the lot, eyeing the front door. Some may have been drawn by the mobile van of a <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> television station, its satellite transmission dish aimed skyward. Mostly, they were curious. It was the first integrated Senior Prom for the school. The last Senior Prom was held in 1962 and blacks did not begin attending <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> High until 1965. A group of black junior high youngsters gathered near the entrance, waiting to see what their older friends and relatives looked like in their tuxedos and formals _ some bought, some made and some rented. `` We'll be going to the Junior Prom'' in May, said <PERSON> Ora </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamerson </PERSON>, 14, from amid a group of four young girls. In the meantime, she was enjoying the spectacle, calling out to her older friends, waving, admiring their togs. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON>, 18, among the older, white onlookers, was n't dressed for the prom. She dropped out of school in January. `` I do n't think it'll work out,'' she said. `` There's a lot of racial problems in <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. I just do n't think it'll work out.'' But police, who were on hand to enforce the school administration's strict no-cigarettes, no-alcohol, no-drug policy, said the celebration proceeded without incident. `` Everything stayed quiet,'' Police Sgt. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> said at 2 a.m. Saturday. Outside the Civic Center, as the prom got under way, there were a few good-natured jeers at unfamiliar finery _ no catcalls or taunts, racial or otherwise. <PERSON> Tangella </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 17, <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president, said just having it all finally come together, after months of planning, was perhaps the most important thing for her. The final day's preparations and decorations took so long that she was 45 minutes late herself. Earlier in the week, she said the prom owed its existence to the enthusiasm of her classmates, who number about 350. `` Each class has their own thoughts about things, each class thinks they're better,'' she said. `` We felt like we would have a prom, and we did.''

 The world's largest commercial jetliner, an enlarged 747 with fuel-efficient engines and electronic cockpit displays, made its aerial debut `` beautifully,'' says the test pilot of the latest <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet. The first <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 was taken on a 2 -LCB- - hour flight Friday from <LOCATION> Paine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, where the jumbo jets are made, to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters Just a few minutes after the newest plane touched down, the original 747, the `` City of <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>,'' which first flew in 1969, also landed at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>. That plane was never flown commercially but has been used by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> for various test programs and now is used for crew training. `` The airplane worked beautifully,'' test pilot <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Loesch </PERSON> told reporters. The new jumbo jet measures 231 feet, 10 inches in length, same as the original, with a 211-foot wingspan, up from 195 feet on the original model 747-100. The new jumbo jet has a stretched upper deck and can carry as many as 660 passengers, but normally would carry about 450 in three classes: first, business and coach. The model 100 seated 385 passengers. Its most noticeable feature are six-foot `` winglets'' tilted upward at the tip of each wing, which improve aerodynamic efficiency. It has a range of 8,400 miles, compared to the 747-100's 5,200 miles. The other major change is on the flight deck, where more than 600 dials and switches have been replaced by six color video screens, allowing a crew of just two to operate the aircraft, instead of the usual three. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> boasts the plane will be able to fly non-stop between such cities as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The plane can be equipped with three different makes of engines _ <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> _ which cut fuel consumption by up to 25 percent over the engines used on the original 747, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> says. The jet that flew Friday, dubbed 747-401, will be delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in December. Two others in the test flight program will be delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cathay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>. The three planes will make about 1,100 hours of test flights under about 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> test pilots and three from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanatta </PERSON>, manager of flight test engineering. About 430 hours of test flying is needed for <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> certification, he said. To date, 18 airlines have ordered 124 of the 747-400s, which cost $ 108 million to $ 126 million each. Because of its fuel economy and other savings, several carriers have changed orders during recent years from earlier 747 versions to the model 400. The new Air Force One will be a 747-400, as will the military E-4A and E-4B, flying command and control stations for national emergencies such as nuclear war.

<HEAD>Volunteers Develop Immune Response To AIDS Vaccine Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first American test of an experimental AIDS vaccine produced an immune response in six volunteers and is an important step toward developing a vaccine against the deadly disease, officials said Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases announced that the men showed the immune reaction to injections of a purified protein, called gp160, derived from a portion of the human immunodeficiency virus. HIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. An immune response is determined when the test subject's blood develops antibodies against the vaccine that was injected. Many steps remain, however, before the work could result in an AIDS vaccine. Dr. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauci </PERSON>, director of the institute, said the vaccine tests were conducted to determine if the gp160-derived vaccine was safe and if it evoked an immune response. He said the results are now positive to both questions. `` It is clear that it is safe, and the study indicates that several volunteers did develop an immune response,'' he said. The test also is designed to help determine the proper dosage of the vaccine for maximum beneficial effect. A report on the study was presented at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. The next step is to remove antibodies from the test subjects and determine if these antibodies will react in test tubes to the AIDS virus. This would establish if the test subjects have developed what is called cell mediated immune response. It is this reaction that provides protection against a targeted disease. The test of gp160 started with 59 volunteers divided into four groups. Each group received injections of a different strength of the gp160. Two subjects in a group that received the injections but no booster shots developed immune response. Four of a group that received both the initial shot and a booster also developed immune response. The study will continue with a group of volunteers receiving an even stronger dose of the gp160 vaccine. AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500 Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000, have died since June 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

 The accidental release of at least 175,000 gallons of a particularly gooey form of crude oil has turned from a minor inconvenience into a major menace to fragile bird rookeries and a major sports fishing industry. `` This is a sin, a crime against God's creation, and makes a city boy want to cry,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallachi </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, who drove 120 miles to voluntarily help state crews remove oil from a city park shoreline. The April 23 spill already has killed 200 birds and small animals and left 250 others suffering ill effects. The spill of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> crude from <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s major <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> refinery occurred after a broken storm drain pipe running through the middle of an oil tank allowed crude to be siphoned out. The company's practice of keeping valves open during storms was a violation of federal environmental regulations. It has been a frustrating week for dozens of volunteers trying to care for dying wildlife and for cleanup workers struggling to remove the tarry muck. They have been busy along a 15-mile stretch of waterway from the <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> to the mouth of the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joaquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, with their major sport fishing industry, and at <ORGANIZATION> Peyton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slough </ORGANIZATION> marsh and <LOCATION> Ryer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, critical wildlife habitat for the endangered clapper rail and dozens of other bird species, including various ducks, blue heron, black rail and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> brown pelican. `` This is the worst possible thing that can happy to a pretty place like this,'' said <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>, 21, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, a state job skills training program, who helped gather up oil. `` It'll never be the same. I do n't think a man's hands can clean all this up,'' added fellow corps member <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 19, rubbing his gloves on yellow protective coveralls nearly black below the chest. `` Shell Oil people should be the ones forced to come down here and clean these rocks themselves,'' he said. Those sentiments are echoed by city residents, by state officials who blasted <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> for violating federal regulations and environmentalists who fear for the future of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s dwindling wetlands, where many shore and water creatures breed and reproduce. `` There's a lot of dismay by almost everybody who lives here,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, city manager of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, population 30,000. Except for <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s administration building, loading dock and wharf, the 1,000-acre refinery is outside city limits, and thus beyond city regulation. At a state hearing at <LOCATION> Martinez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> on the spill Friday, <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> predicted `` there'll be an awful lot of anger, an awful lot of frustration, and an awful lot of anxiety about our future in the company's shadow. `` Up to this point, there's never been such a graphic physical illustration of what the worst-case scenario with that plant could be.'' Local boat owners, many of whom make a living by taking sports fishermen into the delta, fear the oil will harm the estuary's delicate food chain and possibly deplete fish stocks already reduced by decades of water quality problems in the delta Most of the 400 boats at the city's marina still had oil on their hulls this weekend; under federal regulations, they ca n't leave docks until they are cleaned <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> promised to pick up the tab. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area's largest yacht race of the year was canceled Saturday because oil was still in <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>'s harbor. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, vice commodore of the sponsoring <ORGANIZATION> Vallejo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> officials asked for the cancellation, preferring to reimburse the club's losses of up to $ 60,000 rather than possibly being liable for cleaning boats. About 700 boat owners had paid entry fees. Harbormaster <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wysling </PERSON> closed the marina until all oil sheens are removed from the strait and delta. That prevented dozens of ocean fishermen from participating in Sunday's opening of the salmon season. Environmentalists are concerned over the effects of oil in the marshes. `` The marshes are devastated ... and there are toxins in that oil that is seeping into the environment every day,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, a biologist and vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diablo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's going to take a Herculean effort to return it to its natural state,'' he added. `` If they leave it alone, it will take decades to return of its own accord.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON> said the company will `` pay whatever it costs'' to restore the damaged marshes. `` These wetlands and estuaries are the cradle of the oceans, where they get energy and nutrients,'' said <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>. `` We're not insisting on saving them just for aesthetics and recreation. We're talking about saving life itself.

 Striking ferry workers pelted busloads of tourists with rocks and bottles Saturday after mistaking them for strikebreakers, police said. Later, two ferries docked at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> as the company moved to crush the work stoppage. Trouble flared early Saturday when five buses carrying ferry passengers drove to the dock behind a police cruiser with flashing lights. Hundreds of pickets, mistaking the tourists for strikebreaking crews, surged through police lines, threw rocks and bottles at the buses and hammered on the windows, police said. About 150 officers moved in and quickly broke up the dsturbances after scuffles with pickets. <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> police Inspector <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said a bus windshield was smashed but no one was hurt. One striker was arrested but was later released without charge. Police Superintendent <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the buses were carrying passengers into the ferry terminal for crossings on French and Belgian ships to <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ostend </LOCATION>. `` Some of them were schoolchildren,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` They were terrified.'' Police quickly restored order, but <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> McCluskie </PERSON>, leader of the 24,400-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` I can not guarantee it will be peaceful for long. I want peace, but these men and women have been frustrated to the extent I will not be able to control them.'' The P and O strike and support by other seamen also affected crossings from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the Isle of Man, and between <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the Shetland and <LOCATION> Orkney </LOCATION> islands. Later Saturday, two ferries sailed into <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> without incident after crossing the English Channel. Strikebound P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> said the Pride of <LOCATION> Bruges </LOCATION> and the Pride of Kent picked up replacement crews and sailed from <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, one of the world's busiest ports P and O said the two ferries would begin crossing the English Channel on a regular basis. <PERSON> McCluskie </PERSON> said British crews on the P and O ferries `` will be marked as scabs forever.'' The company refused to say when the ferries would try to load passengers and freight and set sail for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The captain of the Pride of Kent, however, told <ORGANIZATION> Dover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in a ship-to-shore radio message: `` We will be laid here for 24 hours _ at least that is Plan A.'' Details of the plan were not made known. `` The ships are in port while provisioning is completed and it is made ready to take passengers,'' said P and O director <PERSON> Graeme </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>. P and O workers are striking to protest the company's plan to cut jobs, lengthen shifts and change work rules to have employees perform more tasks. The company says its must trim its staff so it can compete with the English Channel tunnel connecting <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is set to open in 1992. About 750 pickets gathered on the dockside during the night to protest the arrival of the two P and O ferries from <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>. The ferries, carrying 250 crew members but no passengers, anchored overnight in the Solent and then sailed into port and berthed Saturday morning. P and O and its main rival, <ORGANIZATION> Sealink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION>, hit by a sympathy strike, warned of long delays at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> for any vacationers heading for continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during the three-day British holiday weekend. The Pride of <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> and the Pride of <LOCATION> Bruges </LOCATION> were among five of P and O's 17 vessels that had been moored in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> since the strike began Feb. 4. They were crewed by 250 of the 1,100 P and O seamen who have accepted the company's new terms. P and O this week fired 720 workers still on strike.

<TEXT>
 A hungry bundle of fluff named <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON>, the only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled minced mice Saturday, and keepers of the endangered species were encouraged by its appetite. The newly hatched chick, which raised the condor population to 28, ate its first meal from the fingertips of a handler at 6 a.m. and ate again at hourly intervals, said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park. `` The chick was hungry and ate everything it was offered,'' Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the chick. But the first 10 days are critical, for anybody, human or animal.'' The chick's diet was a combination of minced baby mice and chicken egg yolk, she said. The meals fed to the chick, which is slightly larger than a person's fist, amounted to about two tablespoons of food each time. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> congratulated the Wild Animal Park staff for the successful hatching. `` The hatching of the world's first captive-bred condor is a milestone that we've been awaiting for years,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is responsible for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor recovery program. `` This small chick represents a big step back from the brink of extinction and a big step forward for recovery of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor,'' he said. Keepers delicately wielding tweezers helped the chick break free of its avocado-size egg at 5:38 p.m. Friday, ending a 61 -LCB- - hour hatching process that began when the chick first pecked cracks in the shell Wednesday The laborious process of helping the bird get free, led by biologist <PERSON> Cyndi </PERSON> <PERSON> Keuhler </PERSON>, took nearly eight hours. <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON> is an Indian word for the giant condor species. The name originates from the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maidu </LOCATION> tribe and was chosen by a council of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tribes last week, Ms. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. After hatching, the chick was swaddled in a towel and put in the same type of incubator used for premature infants. The chick weighed about 6 -LCB- ounces. Its sex wo n't be determined for about a month because it must be strong enough for a blood sample to be drawn. The chick will be reared by keepers using a hand puppet that resembles an adult condor. The puppet is used to feed the chick and help it identify with its species. The chick hatched from an egg laid March 3 by the only pair of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors known to be actively breeding. The egg was taken from the parent birds and placed in the incubator in hope that the parents would produce a second egg. That has not happened so far. All 28 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condors known to exist are in captivity: 15 at the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo. Fourteen birds are female. The captive flock includes 13 condors hatched from eggs taken in the wild over the past five years. <PERSON> Molloko </PERSON> was the first addition since April 1986, when a chick named <PERSON> Nojoqui </PERSON> was hatched at the park from an egg laid in the wild. Efforts to save the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor, which has a wingspan of up to 10 feet at maturity, rest with the captive breeding program. The last known wild <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> condor was captured a year ago. The goal of the program is to rebuild the population until condors can be sent back into the wild. The earliest anticipated release would be 1992, authorities have said. The oldest bird hatched in captivity is 5 years old. Condors reach sexual maturity at about age 7.

 Earnest young voices from the inner-city sing liltingly while aspiring musicians experiment with a spectrum of styles each Saturday in a renovated train station just south of downtown. They're members of the MERIT Music Program, designed to develop the talents of children from poor neighborhoods who have no other access to music. Given the chance, they're as receptive as youths whose parents can afford private music lessons, said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, who runs an opera workshop for the private, non-profit program. `` The goal of this program is to provide the opportunity for these underprivileged students to flourish,'' she said in a telephone interview Saturday. Teachers with extensive music backgrounds, many of them professional musicians, provide `` as sophisticated music instruction as you'll find anywhere in the country,'' she said. `` There is no other music school in the country -LRB- like MERIT -RRB- in terms of making our services available to those who can not pay,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> added. But the students are required to have one year of prior music instruction and must audition to get into the program, she said. The centerpiece of the program is its tuition-free Saturday classes for elementary and high school students in the red-brick <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. Inside the old train station, about 200 students get individual and group instruction in classes ranging from beginning piano to advanced musical theory. MERIT, which employs about 33 part-time teachers, also sponsors weekly and bi-weekly music classes in 10 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> public schools _ most of them in poor neighborhoods _ reaching 500 to 600 children, Ms. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. Those classes act as `` feeder programs,'' preparing students who want to participate in the Saturday classes, she said. Once a year, for the past three years, youths in the advanced music theory class have staged an opera composed and performed by students. This year's work, a 45-minute, one-act opera called `` The Ledge,'' is about a disillusioned young violinist who contemplates suicide while facing his best friend's popularity as a rock star. The opera, to be performed Sunday in MERIT's recital hall, features an eclectic combination of music, ranging from classical opera to jazz complete with synthesizer, drums and electric bass guitar. `` I've never really been exposed to opera,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 17, who plays bass guitar in the opera's orchestra. `` What surprised me the most is this was totally put together by us. It was done totally by the students. ... I think it's good,'' said <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a nearly all-black school in an impoverished neighborhood. White, who wants to teach music and perform professionally, has attended MERIT's Saturday classes for 2 -LCB- years. `` They expose you to a lot of different sounds _ classical, jazz _ a lot of different talents they help you to nurture. Someone from my school ... they would n't normally be exposed to that kind of stuff,'' he said. MERIT students have earned scholarships to prestigious music programs like the <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Interlochen </ORGANIZATION> music camp in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The MERIT program was started in 1979 by a professional pianist and an amateur musician, Ms. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. It is entirely funded by grants, mostly from corporations and foundations. Teachers who could be making $ 100 an hour elsewhere earn about $ 20 to $ 30 an hour, and all have outside jobs, said Ms. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, 31, a former <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> music-theory instructor who works full time at a South Side bank. `` I do it simply because it is rewarding,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> said. `` It gives me the opportunity to participate in these young people's discovery of their own ability. It's extremely rewarding.''

He and seven other opposition members face up to five years in prison if convicted of various charges. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> lost the election to President <PERSON> Abdou </PERSON> <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>, receiving only 25 percent of the votes to <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>'s 73 percent. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said <PERSON> Diouf </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rigged the elections, assuring the president of a second five-year term and 103 seats in the 120-seat National Assembly.

 <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is taking its juiced-up tourism campaign overseas to dispel a gangster-ridden image and lure foreign visitors. `` International people still think of us as ` <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> lives next door,' and this is one of the things we have to dispel in their minds,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, international marketing specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION>. To do that, the state and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> have produced an upbeat commercial for British television that describes <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> as a world-class city with a rich culture and nightlife. Tour brochures circulated by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> describe <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> as `` the heart and soul of the Americas.'' They feature inviting views of the city's lakefront and historic sites in other parts of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> are described in detail to get rid of this <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> image that still prevails,'' said <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kegelmann </PERSON>, market development manager in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. The international effort is the latest twist in a four-year campaign that officials credit for significant growth in the state's tourist industry. Since 1984, the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 10 million a year on ads promoting tourism, up from about $ 800,000 in earlier years. From 1984 to 1986, the number of employees in the state's tourism industry increased 14 percent compared with a rise of 9 percent in the nation overall Tourist spending in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in the fiscal year ending June 30 is expected to reach $ 10.8 billion, up 30 percent from $ 8.3 billion three years ago, state officials say. Officials hope to boost those figures further and say foreign tourists are a rich, untapped market, especially in light of the dollar's low value compared with many foreign currencies. They have pursued a variety of strategies to lure foreigners, some costly and some virtually free. To pay for the British commercials, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> each contributed $ 200,000 and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> kicked in $ 40,000. Those commercials attracted the interest of British television executives, who plan to produce a documentary on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> comparing the <LOCATION> Windy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. In the past year, state tourism officials also have helped organize visits by 18 groups of foreign travel agents and tour operators, and six groups of travel journalists. Ms. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said the trips were paid for by airline companies, hotels and others in the industry. State officials do n't expect immediate dividends from the overseas campaign. Their advisers say it typically takes five years to produce a significant response. `` Do n't expect miracles and do n't ask for passenger numbers within the next couple months,'' <PERSON> Kegelmann </PERSON> said. `` It takes time and a little bit of patience, but we are confident we are going to make it.'' One expert believes Illinois might get a little help from the <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> legacy. `` I can understand why -LRB- Illinoisans -RRB- are sensitive about <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> and the so-called violent image of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> but I think it has changed over the years to become a colorful image,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s international division.

<TEXT>
 Arizona Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> says he is investigating whether to prosecute Gov. Rose Mofford for omitting land, loan and partnership transactions from sworn financial-disclosure statements. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> is prosecuting Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, over omission of a $ 350,000 campaign loan from similar financial-disclosure statements, and <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers are sure to object if Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> is treated any differently. But <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> also is next in line to become governor should anything happen to Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, much as Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> upon his ouster by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Impeachment </ORGANIZATION> in April. `` He's in somewhat of a delicate position,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, a Democrat, said Friday after Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> filed amended financial disclosure statements. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, a Democrat, called her ommissions `` an honest mistake'' and said she did not intend to hide the transactions reported a week before by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, used the same language last year when his ommission was reported by The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Aides said Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s share of the unreported transactions would total $ 67,000 at most. Knowing failure to file a complete disclosure statement is a misdemeanor under <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> law. Intentional false swearing is a felony. `` It's kind of the same thing that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had, and we'll wait until the <PERSON> A.G. </PERSON> tells us what he thinks,'' said House Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a Republican who set impeachment hearings in motion against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. `` We're going to treat her just like we did Gov. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. There's really no difference.'' But <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said aspects of the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> case that show intent to conceal are not present in the Mofford case. He cited the size of the developer's loan to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a letter in which <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> promised to keep it confidential and a paper trail that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> prosecutors described as a laundering scheme. On the other hand, aides acknowledge, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> spent 10 years as secretary of state in command of the office where the forms are filed and in charge of preparing the instructions on how to fill out the forms in the first place. Asked for his reaction to Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>'s action, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said Friday, `` I have no comment because the matter is under investigation.'' As late as Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> had described reports about the undisclosed transactions as `` nitpicking.'' On Friday, however, she filed new forms and turned over records to <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s office. `` I now believe that these items should have been disclosed earlier,'' she said at a news conference cut short by her aides. `` I made an honest mistake.'' `` I'm very sorry,'' she added. `` I want to emphasize that it was never my intent to hide anything from anybody.'' Asked how her position differed from that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> replied `` mine are very small amounts of money'' and added that the transactions did not even offset what she had advanced her former husband, T.R. Mofford, for hospital bills before he died in 1982. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said she did not list the land, loans and partnerships because she did not make much money on them or because her interest in some of them was tied to Mofford, whom she divorced in 1967. `` I have never made any profit,'' she said. `` I was paying my husband's bills.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> and her aides acknowledged, however, that she had not listed her former husband's gifts under a reporting section that requires disclosure of gifts above $ 500 or, alternatively, listed the money she advanced to his estate for hospital bills in a section covering amounts of more than $ 1,000 owed to or by the officeholder. The holdings also were not reported under the section for disclosing real estate. Records released Friday show her being paid well over $ 30,000 for two properties alone, but aides said she had incurred some costs as well. The records were incomplete, and no exact accounting was available. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> did not return messages left at his home and office Friday.

The occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were relatively quiet after one of the calmest weeks since a Palestinian uprising began December 8. Israeli officials, encouraged by the relative calm, have claimed that the protests are fading. In the main marketplace of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest city in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths attacked <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops with stones, according to an army representative who spoke on condition of anonymity. The troops opened fire and wounded a protester, he said. Arab reporters in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said a second protester was wounded. In the nearby <LOCATION> Balata </LOCATION> refugee camp, young Palestinians hurled stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, injuring one, the spokesman said. Troops wounded a protester there too, he said. The military clamped a curfew on the camp right after the incident, forcing residents to stay home. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a group of Jewish settlers from the nearby <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> settlement were surrounded by stone-throwing youths, the spokesman said. The settlers fired shots in the air until troops arrived, he said, and there were no injuries. Also Saturday, a Palestinian youth arrived at <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s Alia hospital with a gunshot wound in his arm, a doctor said. The army confirmed the report but said it was not clear how the youth was shot. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, students blocked a main street with flaming tires, boulders and trash cans, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. They waved outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and chanted: `` Our lives for Palestine!'' The students dispersed on army orders, the reporters said. Since anti-Israeli violence broke out in the occupied territories, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> War, 175 Palestinians have been slain. One Israeli soldier and one Israeli civilian have been killed. <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists, in a leaflet circulated late Friday, urged Arabs to keep the uprising alive and said `` the blood of our martyrs must not be spilled for nothing.'' It called for commercial strikes and a `` day of confrontation with the occupation forces'' on Sunday. The leaflet, signed by the `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> of the Upsrising,'' also made its most direct call for attacks on Israeli-appointed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> mayors who have refused to yield to the militants' demands that they resign. It singled out the mayors of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Bireh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> protested a cartoon published in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times depicting <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> being turned away from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, who told him the city was a closed military area. The cartoon, published March 30, was an apparent reference to the frequent closures imposed by the military in the occupied territories in an effort to quell the uprising. `` In all its history, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> has never been freer or more open to visitors to holy places than it is now,'' <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> declared in a telegram to the paper earlier this week, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sevannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Meryn </PERSON> on Friday. The cartoon was one of two that angered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The second cartoon, published April 27, depicted an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier holding a smoking rifle atop a pile of bullet-ridden bodies. The caption read: `` I'm willing to talk peace, but there are n't any Palestinians to talk peace with!''

 Older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s, like the jet that ripped open over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> last week, were restricted Saturday from flying at altitudes above 23,000 feet until they can be inspected for structural defects. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> issued an emergency order for jets in the 737-100 and 737-200 series that have had more than 55,000 flights. The order affects 66 planes, half of them in the fleets of <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> and American airlines, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. The rest belong to international carriers. Federal investigators are focusing on possible structural failure in the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet that blew open Thursday at 24,000 feet. A flight attendant was swept out of the plane to her death and 61 passengers were injured. Under the airworthiness directive issued by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, the airlines must complete visual inspections of the affected area within the next 500 flights. `` They must inspect the area for cracking, corrosion or de-lamination and if any is found, it must be repaired and the suspect pieces replaced,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said. The area to be inspected is the top of the fuselage. In the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> jet, a huge upper section of the 737-200 tore away, leaving passengers exposed to the open skies and forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said that at altitudes of 23,000 feet or below, the pressure between the outside and inside of the aircraft is such that a structural weakness would not cause a failure or damage to the plane. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> originally said that all 66 affected jets belonged to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. However, he later said that about half of the jets belonged to international airlines. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> did not know which ones. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also did not know which international carriers flew the affected 737s. He said the company would try to find that out Monday. A <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kress </PERSON>, said from <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that the airline had already begun inspecting the 17 affected 737-200s in its fleet. He said such inspections were part of the airline's regular maintenance program for the jets and the order would have `` virtually no effect on our operation.'' `` The aircraft is such that we use it on short hauls anyhow and we do n't need to attain that altitude of 23,000 feet,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Goto </PERSON> said he had n't heard of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order and had no immediate comment. <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> has three jets affected by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order, in addition to the one involved in the accident, according to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said 16 of its 737s were affected by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order, and those are used on short-haul West Coast routes that do not require flying above 23,000 feet. Spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that the airline would inspect those planes within 48 hours. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> action `` prudent,'' and said, `` We're going to comply with it more quickly than required We're simply going to do it as quickly as we can.'' Last October 5, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered close inspection of the upper skin of the early model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s because routine inspections had turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap. The agency warned the problem could cause rapid cabin decompression. The inspections also found metal strips on the fuselage coming loose on some early-model <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s because the lamination was no longer holding. The earlier <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive covered the first 291 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s manufactured, of which the Aloha plane was No. 152. It had been in service since 1969. <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has said it conducted the inspections in October as ordered but found nothing that caused alarm. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> the company has issued service bulletins on the need for periodic inspections for possible cracking or structural weakening because of corrosion of the skin of the older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s. <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON> said the company's most recent bulletin had been issued two weeks before Thursday's incident. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said Saturday's directive was broader than the one issued in October because the new directive orders visual inspections of the entire top of the fuselage. He said the order will probably mean an increase in fuel costs for the airlines because the higher a jet flies, te more fuel-efficient it is. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said Friday that investigators believed the cause of the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident was a structural problem with the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> jet. He also said the jet had been through 85,000 to 90,000 takeoff-and-landing cycles, and called that `` a high cycle number'' because of the stress caused by repeated expansions and contractions of the fuselage. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> asked for inspection of all <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 jets that have completed more than 55,000 takeoff and landing cycles. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> grounded three jets similar in age to the one involved in Thursday's accident.

 Prosecutors at the trial of alleged drug lord <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> produced more than 100 witnesses over 22 weeks to show that he operated a multimillion-dollar smuggling business centered on the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. While the prosecution tried to draw a noose around <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, it also presented evidence of the key role of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> island chain, and a federal grand jury reportedly is looking into the activities of Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 38, is accused of conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through his private island in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, from 1978 to 1980. The Colombian is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operation of a continuing criminal enterprise. His co-defendant, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is charged only with conspiracy. The prosecution rested its case against the two Thursday. The defense is expected to begin Monday and to last at least two weeks. `` The issue in this case is not whether Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was a drug smuggler but whether Mr. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> as an individual committed the 11 crimes charged,'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s attorneys, said last week. When the jury selection started in October, attorneys said they expected the trial to last from six weeks to three months. But, counting jury selection and a two-week Christmas recess, the trial has ended its 30th week. `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> pursued a singular dream, a singular vision: to be the king of cocaine transportation,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> said in his opening statement in mid-November. `` He was to cocaine transportation what <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was to cars.'' While in federal prison during the 1970s, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> began hatching his plans to form a cocaine-smuggling empire, prosecutors said. The Colombian first began smuggling small amounts of the drug inside the lining of suitcases, using young women as couriers, according to testimony. The smuggling, witnesses testified, became bolder as time progressed. Key prosecution witness <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, an admitted smuggler, described <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay, about 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, as the perfect transshipment point. The island was sparsely populated, had a 3,000-foot airstrip and no police or customs officials. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> testified that he flew 10 loads of Colombian cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, whom he met in 1979. The trial also has touched on alleged payoffs to <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> officials, including allegations from numerous witnesses that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> filled his pockets with bribes from smugglers such as <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> testified that he gave former Bahamian Agriculture Minister <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> $ 100,000 that was `` supposed to go directly to the prime minister, Prime Minister <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>.'' Law enforcement sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said that <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> has been presenting evidence about <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> to a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, including reams of material first presented at the <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> trial. Other news reports have said that the grand jury investigation was located in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, rather than <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, when asked last week about whether a grand jury was investigating <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, said, `` I ca n't comment on that.'' <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s name has frequently been mentioned in relation to drug investigations, but in 1984, a royal commission of inquiry in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> found that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> had more money than known income, but none of that appeared to be drug-related. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> won re-election a year ago by invoking the fear common to small nations in this hemisphere that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is meddling in their affairs. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s spokesman in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, said Friday he had heard reports of grand jury investigations in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, but that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> did n't expect to be indicted. `` Most of the testimony at the <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> trial is recycled from the commission of inquiry,'' <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said. He added that the grand jury `` might be hearing some of the same plea-bargaining witnesses that are appearing at the <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> trial.'' Much of the testimony in the trial has come from convicted drug smugglers granted immunity from prosecution or awaiting sentencing. At one point in <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial, defense attorneys reminded prosecutors and jurors that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> was not on trial. But in his opening statement, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> had told jurors, `` You also will hear evidence that <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was making payoffs directly the prime minister of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, still the prime minister now, <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is also charged in separate indictments in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of the so-called <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cartel </LOCATION>, believed to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ a drug operation worth $ 8 billion each year.

 The government on Saturday ordered an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television correspondent to leave the country after he reported that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has a `` tightly controlled and at times even repressive society.'' Correspondent <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, one of only a small number of American television correspondents based in Arab countries, was given a week to leave <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Information Minister <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassawneh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' feature about <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Sunday Today'' was `` clearly against the country.'' He also accused the correspondent of `` breaking the ethics of reporting'' by complaining about security and <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would protest the government action, but he said he could not comment further until consulting with the network headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who has worked for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> for 13 years, has reported on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> since 1979 and has been based in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> since March 1985. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement addressed to King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. It said: `` Your majesty, we protest in the strongest possible terms the expulsion of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> from the kingdom of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the only American television network correspondent stationed in an Arab country, is a veteran reporter who has been ably covering <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> continually for the past three years. His journalistic efforts have been widely recognized as being fair, insightful, authoritative and intelligent. It is indeed shameful that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has now joined <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in denying press credentials to a distinguished and expert <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> corresponsdent stationed within its borders.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Callahan </PERSON>, director of news information for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials indicated the network could replace <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, but no decision has been made by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The action against <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> came four days after neighboring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, technically at war with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, suspended the press credentials of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankel </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said they violated censorship rules by failing to submit for clearance stories alleging that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was behind the assassination in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> military chief <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>. In his profile of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> referred to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as `` tightly controlled and at times even repressive society.'' He noted that the headquarters of the `` not-so-secret police'' is sometimes termed `` the Palestinian hotel'' because of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists often imprisoned there. The program also included a clip of radical <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Habash </PERSON> accusing King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of a `` barbarous massacre'' of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> civilians during the Black September fighting between the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the Jordanian army in 1970. Thousands of people died. <PERSON> Hassawneh </PERSON> said the program `` insulted King <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>,'' <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s first ruler and grandfather of King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, by saying the British appointed <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> emir when <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was created as a British protectorate after World War I `` It was very clear to us he was a very biased man,'' <PERSON> Hassawneh </PERSON> said. American networks once kept correspondents in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, to cover the Arab world, but pulled them out after journalists became targets of kidnappers in 1985 and 1986. They now rely largely on term-contract journalists and free-lancers based in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and other Arab countries, and they send in Europe-based staff correspondents for major stories. Journalists rarely have been expelled from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in recent years, although the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 blacklisted two Israel-based Western reporters for stories about Jordanian suppression of demonstrations. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> quickly lifted those bans.

 Two small earthquakes rattled Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Saturday, one an aftershock of the destructive Oct. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Whittier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narrows </ORGANIZATION> temblor and the other near the Mexican border, authorities said. The aftershock measuring 3.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit at 11:40 a.m., said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. Its epicenter was placed four miles southeast of <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> on the fault that produced the October quake, which caused millions of dollars in damage. A quake measuring 3.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale hit just before 9 a.m. about 12 miles southeast of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said. No injuries or damage were reported in either quake, sheriff's deputies said Quakes with a Richter reading of less than 3.5 can cause slight damage in a local area. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.

<TEXT>
 Some 10,000 union members and civil rights activists rallied Saturday to demand jobs with better pay and better benefits. `` People are n't poor because they do n't have jobs, but because of the low pay for the jobs they've got,'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Commissioner of Agriculture <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> told the crowd. The rally in the Atlanta Civic Center parking lot marked the end of a four-state `` pilgrimage for economic justice'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. The journey began in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, on April 4, 20 years after the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was assassinated in that city. The pilgrimage demonstrated the `` rebirth of the coalition of labor unions and civil rights workers seeking full employment with decent wages,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION>, which King founded. `` The current minimum wage -LRB- $ 3.35 an hour -RRB- just wo n't do it.'' `` We have come to protest the policies that have turned the world's mightiest industrial power into a declining nation,'' said <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, daughter of the slain civil rights leader. Speakers assailed <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who has been demanding concessions from unionized employees of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> unit. `` While he is demanding a 60 percent cut in your wages, he is banking one-half million dollars in wages and benefits,'' said <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>. `` He is saying he is the top dog and you're a bunch of fire hydrants.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, lashed out at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>, who he claimed is vigorously opposing efforts to unionize janitors at buildings <PERSON> Portman </PERSON> owns. `` When you're a janitor making $ 3.35 an hour with no benefits, you're forced to subsist with the help of the taxpayer,'' <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> said. Working people `` are subsidizing the owners of these big, downtown buildings,'' he added. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> saw several contrasts between April's <ORGANIZATION> SCLC </ORGANIZATION> march and civil rights marches in the 1960s, including the presence this time of many black elected officials and greater police support. `` The blue lights were warm and welcoming,'' he said of police escorts marchers received in parts of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. `` In the'60s, the lights were hostile and forboding.'' Drugs joined poverty as a theme in the latest march, <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` We're calling the drug pushers the new lynch mob, and they're much more threatening than the old lynch mob,'' he said Elsewhere Saturday, a crowd estimated at up to 10,000 people staged a leisurely demonstration in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs, arms control and changes in policies toward <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stepped up criticism of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Saturday, saying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor fails to offer a clear alternative to Republican policies. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> avoided saying directly that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be like a Republican, but he told a labor forum in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, `` Democrats must be the alternative. We do not need two Republican parties in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked by reporters if he meant to say that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would pull Democrats toward Republican policies. `` I would not put him in that category,'' he said. `` There are some in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who would pull our party toward conservatism.'' He then gave a litany of issues on which he thinks <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not presented a strong commitment or budgetary priority for change: childcare, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, education, drugs. It was clear as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigned in search of votes for Tuesday's primary in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that he wants to cast <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a weaker voice against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> policies than his own. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also spoke repeatedly of the importance of having leaders who can inspire, an apparent effort to showcase himself as an inspirational candidate in contrast to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' low-key demeanor that many find dull. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> drew repeated applause in the hall full of unionists as he focused on labor issues and called himself a `` working people's person. At a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> gymnasium, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> continued to suggest that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was a managerial candidate, while he is a leader. He said attainment of peace in the world and changing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policy requires leadership, not management. `` To end Reaganomics we need a leader. We need to change the course,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the cheering, racially mixed crowd. `` To find peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, we must have leadership. We can not manage apartheid, We must end apartheid.'' In the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> appearance and later at a <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> rally, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> tried to put a damper on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' of economic recovery during his tenure as governor. `` Even in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lost 11 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 1984,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said however that `` It's not the fault of Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. It's the fault of Reaganomics.'' `` The best of governors are not a substitute for a president who leads,'' he said. He then added in a two-sided comment, `` Do n't blame Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because union membership has plummetted.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign cites an increase of 400,000 jobs in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> during nine years under <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contended, `` Sure there are more jobs. More jobs, less wages.'' He told reporters that if other states had received the contracts for research and development that <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> had received, they too would be economically prospering and that `` a combination of circumstances'' contributed to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' success He continued to say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has shown no commitment to reverse President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies but would only `` manage Reaganomics.'' He ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for offering only $ 250 million in new education spending saying, `` You can not educate every child in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to go to college on only $ 250 million.'' `` We need a massive commitment to invest in people, reinvest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and end Reaganomics,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> rally of about 1,500 people organized by churches and labor groups. He also accused both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, of failing to show their priorities by setting out a budget. On one of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s primary campaign themes _ increasing taxes on corporations, including those that escape taxation through loopholes _ he referred to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' proposal to raise revenue by stepping up enforcement on uncollected taxes. `` It's not about uncollected taxes. It's exempted taxes, and unregulated behavior of corporate baracudas,'' he said.

 A federal judge says he'll ignore federal sentencing guidelines on the ground they violate the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution's separation of powers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON>, ruling Friday in the case of two people convicted of a December bank robbery, said he intended to sentence them as though their crimes had occurred before November, when the sentencing guidelines went into effect. The guidelines, intended to remedy disparities between the sentences handed down by federal judges across the country, require them to follow a schedule of mandatory sentences. The guidelines, <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON> ruled, `` are not simply guideposts to aid the exercise of judicial discretion ... They reduce the role of sentencing judges to filling in the blanks and applying a rigid, mechanical formula.'' <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which produced the guidelines, was acting `` in place of the judge.'' He also held unconstitutional the commission itself, required by law to include three federal judges and four non-judiciary members, all appointed by the president. `` Mandatory service of judges on the commission violates the doctrine of separation of powers,'' <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON> said. `` Constitutional separation of powers,'' <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON> said, `` is so fundamental to our governmental system that every schoolchild learns about our system of checks and balances.'' <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON>'s ruling was almost certain to be appealed because of the constitutional question it raises. <PERSON> Shoob </PERSON> also has challenged federal officials over treatment of Cuban refugees jailed in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> federal penitentiary, saying they were being held unfairly.

 Two former underground Solidarity leaders were released from prison Saturday and flew to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> after initially refusing to leave the country. <PERSON> Kornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>, 46, and <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON>, 28, were put on a plane to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and arrived in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Saturday night. The communist government released the two men from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s Rakowiecka prison Saturday in a deal with Roman Catholic church officials <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> had been driven to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s airport to board a flight for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, but the two refused to leave after meeting with family members at the airport. The two were then taken back to the prison but agreed to leave the country after more talks at the prison involving church officials. One of <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>'s daughters, <PERSON> Marta </PERSON>, said the two men were told they could either leave together or remain imprisoned. She said medical reasons played a role in the decision to leave. The two were given multiple exit-and-entry passports and were expected to undergo medical treatment in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Both apparently are suffering from ulcers and other medical problems. <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>, who was arrested Nov. 9, 1987, was chairman of the militant splinter group Fighting Solidarity. He went underground after martial law was declared in December 1981 and the Solidarity union federation was suspended and subsequently outlawed. In 1982, he formed Fighting Solidarity, which differs from Solidarity because it advocates anti-communist political goals. Solidarity emphasizes social and union issues. <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> headed Fighting Solidarity from the time of <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>'s arrest until his own capture in January. He had been in hiding since 1985. A third, less prominent Fighting Solidarity activist, <PERSON> Krzystof </PERSON> <PERSON> Szymanski </PERSON>, also was released Saturday. <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>'s elder daughter, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> had agreed to leave the country in a deal worked out by church officials. But after family members at the airport told them about new strikes in the country, they decided to stay. Asked to explain what finally prompted the two men to leave, <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> said, `` We can not give you a full explanation. There were very important arguments and they both finally agreed to go.'' `` There were some personal reasons which had to be taken into account, also a serious danger to <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON>'s health,'' she said. <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoja </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON>'s girlfriend, said official documents indicated the two men were being released at the recommendation of a commission of prison doctors `` due to the required urgent medical examination, which may also take place abroad.'' She said <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> suffered from ulcers and teeth problems, while <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> had ulcer symptoms, poor eyesight and heart and kidney problems. <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>, speaking with reporters in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said he and <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> at first did not want to leave <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> because they were not told why they were being sent to the West. He said the issue was settled after they spoke with a secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Aloizj </PERSON> <PERSON> Orszulik </PERSON>. `` We decided to leave for three reasons,'' he said. `` First the medical diagnosis'' that <PERSON> Koldziej </PERSON> might have a tumor, `` secondly the possibility that it might be more difficult in the future for the Polish church to perform these humanitarian acts if we refused, and lastly the assurance that we would be allowed to return whenever we choose.'' <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> said that while in prison he was never told anything about what was happening in the country. `` I only learned something today,'' he said. `` There is an agitation going on that reminds me of August of 1980. ... I believe this pressure will increase and I hope it might lead to a change in government.'' In August 1980, nationwide strikes led to the creation of Solidarity. It was chartered by the government and became the first independent union federation in the Soviet bloc but was banned after the December 1981 crackdown. Authorities alleged that <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> were part of a ring that attempted to smuggle equipment intended for terrorist use from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. They were never formally charged. In a statement in November, <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON> denied the allegations. In September 1986, the communist government issued a broad amnesty for political prisoners. Since then, all political activists jailed have been held on criminal charges. In another development, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorny </PERSON>, the Solidarity leader in the southern <LOCATION> Silesian </LOCATION> industrial region was released after an appeals court on Friday suspended his sentence, Solidarity sources said. <PERSON> Gorny </PERSON> was serving an 18-month sentence at a prison in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> after being convicted of failing to pay alimony and using false identity cards. He staged a hunger strike in February to protest against his sentence.

 Strikers occupying a machinery plant in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> ended their sit-in Saturday after apparently winning promises of higher pay, but a walkout by thousands of steel workers persisted with no end in sight. The developments came as the Polish government prepared for its big May Day celebrations. Solidarity, the banned trade union federation, called for nationwide protests to mark the nation's biggest official holiday In the history of the communist government, there has never been a large-scale strike in progress on May Day. Strike leaders said dozens of police vans and vehicles including water cannons moved into positions near the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steel mill in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> late Saturday. There were also large numbers of police in other parts of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in an apparent show of strength before May Day. More than 40 opposition activists were rounded up by police to prevent them from taking part in the holiday protests, said <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Solidarity spokesman. One of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s senior anti-government activists, <PERSON> Kornel </PERSON> <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON>, founder of the splinter dissident group Fighting Solidarity, was freed from prison nearly six months after his arrest through apparent negotiations by the country's powerful Roman Catholic church. <PERSON> Morawiecki </PERSON> was freed with <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolodziej </PERSON>, another member of Fighting Solidarity. The two men were flown to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> after initially refusing to leave. A strike by what organizers said was about 15,000 workers at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> steel mill in <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> entered its fifth day with no sign of a breakthrough. The 7,000 striking workers occupying a heavy machinery plant at <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, about 150 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, left the factory Saturday at about 2 p.m. after management agreed to their pay demands, said <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Surdy </PERSON>, a spokesman for the strikers. The Rev. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemiec </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, said the strikers received nothing in writing but that their demands were expected to be met. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> also reported the one-day strike ended but denied there were any negotiations with the strikers. `` In view of the illegal character of the protest action, no negotiations had been held with the striking group,'' the report said. The labor crisis began Monday and is the most serious to confront <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the December 1981 declaration of martial law and the banning of Solidarity. In a positive development for the government, <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s tram drivers ignored a Solidarity call for a strike Saturday. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> was to address the nation during the May Day celebration in the capital of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, which was festooned with banners, red party flags and red-and-white national colors in the country's biggest official holiday. The holiday is dedicated to working people and in recent years has been an occasion for sometimes violent protests for Solidarity. Surdy, a student and twice-jailed Solidarity activist, said Saturday he was surprised that authorities had not attempted to stop the <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> strike before the holiday. In a communique issued through the Polish news agency <ORGANIZATION> Interpress </ORGANIZATION>, the plant management said that as of Saturday, it would begin docking strikers' pay and would close down restaurants and snack bars on the plant grounds. In an apparent hardening of the positions of strikers, three fired Solidarity activists _ including <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, the former head of the Solidarity at the plant _ were named to the strike committee. One of the committee's demands is that the three be rehired. Unlike <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s last wave of labor unrest in 1980-81, which gave rise to Solidarity, the workers did not cover the plant with banners or mix political and economic demands. Photographs taken in work areas inside the plant showed workers reading newsapers, sleeping or talking on the telephone. After four days of the strike `` there is weariness and already a little boredom,'' <PERSON> Surdy </PERSON> said, but he emphasized that workers intended to stay off the jobs `` until our demands are met.'' Besides the reinstatement of the fired workers, the steel workers are demanding an immediate 50 percent raise on the average salary of $ 105 a month. At <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>, where the occupation strike began Friday, the demands included a $ 50 monthly raise, reinstatement of coal allowances and release and rehiring of three other dismissed Solidarity activists. Church sources said earlier Saturday that one of the Solidarity activists had been freed from detention. Solidarity last month urged that May 1 be `` a day of protest'' against the nationwide price increases that have raised prices 42 percent in the first three months of 1988. Union activists applied for permission to march Sunday in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> but were turned down. However, opposiiton sources said the march was planned anyway.

 The fault-riddled rock layers under the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> desert blur and diminish shock waves from underground explosions, but weekend tests showed cheating under a nuclear test ban still could be detected, scientists said. Experiments using buried charges of conventional explosive and a network of sensitive instruments proved that even the smallest explosions can be monitored, said research geophysicist <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Eissler </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Eissler </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION>, was part of a team from the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that set up modified earthquake-monitoring equipment to record shock waves from three detonations of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> in remote areas of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Friday and Saturday. The third and largest test Saturday showed clearly on seismic equipment here, producing cheers from scientists. The first test Friday was less obvious and a second one later Friday showed up on only the most sophisticated instruments, Ms. <PERSON> Eissler </PERSON> said. `` The experiment is successful,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Archambeau </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado-Boulder </ORGANIZATION> geophysics professor, said after seismometers detected the first detonation of 10 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` It means that we can more accurately gauge the numbers and distribution of stations that will be required to verify a low-threshold treaty. It also will help us to set the threshold of what's verifiable,'' he said. <PERSON> Archambeau </PERSON> heads the seismic monitoring advisory committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private group conducting the experiments in this country and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in cooperation with the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Following the explosion of 10 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> buried beneath the desert 100 miles north of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and another 10-ton shot 50 miles south of the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site on Friday, a 15-ton detonation was set off Saturday about 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 210 miles northeast of Deep Springs. The blasts were monitored by Soviet and American equipment here in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> about midway between <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and at two permanent <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> installations closer to the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site 110 miles north of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, where all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> underground nuclear detonations are conducted. An additional 140 temporary monitoring stations were set up across <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Experiments similar to this weekend's were conducted by the Soviet and American scientists last September near the Soviet test site in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. Because of the geology of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the readings there were much more pronounced than those so far in the fractured foundations of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. `` It was a very small signal, but it was a discernible signal,'' Ms. <PERSON> Eissler </PERSON> said of Friday's first test. She noted that a limited nuclear test ban treaty passed Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> forbids detonations larger than one kiloton, 100 times the strength of the 10-ton TNT blast. She said Friday's first test was recorded here at about three times normal background noise, and the second explosion was barely detectable. Saturday's larger explosion registered about 10 times background noise, Ms. <PERSON> Eissler </PERSON> said. The scientists initially thought Friday's first detonation failed to register on any of the seismic monitors, but a more detailed study indicated the test was recorded successfully 100 seconds after the blast. `` This is about the size we'd expect in this terrain,'' <PERSON> Archambeau </PERSON> said. He called <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s complex geology `` a worst-case situation -LRB- that -RRB- will help us design networks that can do verification in these rather difficult areas.'' The experiments are expected to show that `` any chances for cheating are about excluded'' under a test ban, said <PERSON> Evgeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and an adviser to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We think the comprehensive test ban is very important,'' he added. `` It is extremely important to stop the arms race.'' The testing equipment was designed `` to feel the difference between nuclear and industrial explosions and ... very small earthquakes,'' according to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, senior staff scientist for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded to criticism from Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday, saying `` I think maybe it's time for him to stop criticizing others,'' and defended his leadership ability against rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s sharpened charges. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential front-runner, answered the increasing criticism from his competitors only when questioned by reporters. He had avoided any mention of his rivals during a day of campaigning in two states. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor pointed to his state's economic record in trying to deflect <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s suggestion that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was offering only a managerial approach to governing and lacked the leadership abilities that he provides. `` When it comes to leadership, I'm very proud of the fact that I'm governor of a state which is generally viewed to be a state that's way out front,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` My kind of leadership is as a doer, and not a talker.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has also come under fire from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who a day earlier charged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with `` waffling all over the field'' in his reaction to the administration's decision to attack Iranian positions in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. He was asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments that he has `` cannon fodder'' to use against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the fall, suggesting it was some unknown evidence from the governor's administration in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> `` I really do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are interested in what <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thinks of me and I think of him and whether he's got cannon fodder or whatever it is that he's got,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` I think maybe it's time for him to stop criticizing others and to begin to address some fundamental issues that face this country,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Running with a big delegate lead and confident of his standing in the remaining primaries, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has campaigned cautiously and strived to avoid the suggestion of acrimony. His campaign schedule has been carried out in a manner that has limited his availability to take questions, while he has delivered speeches repeating familiar themes and exhorting supporters not to become overconfident. Earlier in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told supporters they must take `` this primary seriously.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor took an early morning stroll through an outdoor fruit market in downtown <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and later spoke to union members at a half-empty labor hall in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> less than an hour after <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> received an enthusiastic response for his speech before the same group. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also spoke to a largely black group in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's anti-drug efforts and told them his aim was `` to open up that door of opportunity to all citizens, no matter who they are or where they come from or what the color of their skin.'' `` That's really what this campaign is all about,'' he said. He traveled to <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> where he attended the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner and planned to visit a high school prom where aides said he would deliver a message on the dangers of drinking and driving. With a large and growing lead in delegates over <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and a primary calender strongly in his favor, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been urging supporters at every stop to ignore the polls and work to produce a large turnout. Standing amid new sofas and tables on the loading dock of a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> furniture store, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke optimistically of winning the nomination but also urged them not to become complacent. `` I want to ask you once again to do everything you can, on those phone banks, in your neighborhoods, with your friends and co-workers, to make sure the people are taking this primary seriously, that they know it is important,'' he said. `` If we work together ... we're going to win in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, we're going to win in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> ... and we're going to win this nomination,'' he said In urging his voters to turn out on Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeatedly referred to his own 1978 re-election defeat in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> despite a one-time lead in the polls. `` It was the most painful experience of my life,'' he told union members in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He compared the experience to being a worker laid off from his job, although he added that in his case it was his own fault. `` I know what it's like,'' he said.

 Times are good for cable television. It has become a $ 12 billion industry whose programming is watched in more than half of all American households, and subscribership is continuing to grow. But the industry is also wary of how long this prosperity will last. Cable TV is no longer a highly regulated industry weighted down with debt from stringing cable to build community systems. Most of the systems are built and cable operators have more control than ever over what viewers see and how much they pay. `` It's a very healthy industry; it's never been healthier,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, a media analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Life is good in the cable industry right now.'' But some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> think it may be too good. Lawmakers, prompted by complaints from constituents about rate increases and poor service and the competitive concerns of others in the entertainment industry, have raised the specter of reregulating the cable industry. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, fired a warning shot at the industry at a congressional hearing in March, saying `` some of us feel we were had'' by a law that freed most cable companies of municipal rate control in January 1987. He and other lawmakers wonder aloud whether cable has become an unregulated monopoly. The threat from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> `` is a concern you ca n't ignore,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said, and this and other regulatory issues are on the minds of cable operators attending their industry's annual convention here this week. More than 13,000 people were expected to attend the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention, which runs from Sunday through Tuesday. Cable TV systems added more than 4 million subscribers in 1987, putting the households receiving cable at 51 percent _ about 45 million. Now that many of cable operators have finished building their systems _ wiring more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> households _ cable companies are beginning to pay off their debt and have cash to spend on programming. Cable is looking to programming to attract new subscribers, and the industry is encouraged by the success of efforts like <PERSON> Showtime </PERSON>'s critically acclaimed `` It's <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shandling </PERSON>'s Show,'' a series that now also airs on the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> broadcasting network. Home Box Office's `` Dear <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: Letters Home from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' also received high marks from TV critics, and the Entertainment and <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION>, has landed some big sports contracts, including <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> games. `` Things are going extraordinarily well for cable,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Alter </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabletelevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` People are discovering the choice in programming that cable offers.'' Cable systems are adding subscribers at the rate of 1 percent to 2 percent a year, and those with the wire are spending nearly as much time watching programming produced by cable as they do viewing programs of the three major broadcast networks, he said. Increased viewership boosted cable advertising sales above the $ 1 billion mark last year, and ad revenues are expected to hit $ 1.5 billion this year, he said. Each new subscriber is worth about $ 2,000 to the asset value of many cable systems, he said. `` There is a tremendous incentive on cable to sharpen its marketing skills to build its subscriber base,'' he said. Rates have also risen since deregulation 16 months ago, and that has concerned <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> says prices in some systems have risen by up to 400 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> NCTA </ORGANIZATION>, however, says the average cable subscriber's monthly bill rose 6.7 percent in the first six months after deregulation. While basic service prices rose about 10.6 percent, rates for premium or pay channels like <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> dropped 2.5 percent, according to the study.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, the former secretary to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, has been named by a federal grand jury as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Iran-Contra affair, a newspaper reported Saturday. Miss <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> was named along with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>, a former assistant to North on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff, and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The action, which has been kept under court seal, allows independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to use the testimony of the unindicted co-conspirators against the prosecutor's primary targets: North, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, retired Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and Iranian-born arms dealer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. Citing unidentified sources close to the investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the move is significant because it distinguishes Miss Hall, <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> from conventional witnesses whose testimony would apply only to one defendant at a time. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieghart </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, declined to comment on the report Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Plato </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacheris </PERSON> said: `` I do n't regard her as a co-conspirator, and this is grossly unfair and incorrect.'' North, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> were indicted on charges of conspiring to divert <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Hearsay testimony from an alleged member of a conspiracy, even if unindicted, can be used against all members of the conspiracy because the witness was close to events, the Times said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has reportedly granted full immunity to Miss Hall and <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> has not been granted immunity, however, and could still face charges, sources told the Times. In testimony before a congressional committee last year, Miss <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> admitted removing classified materials from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> offices while she was <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s personal secretary. She and <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> have admitted shredding documents later sought in the investigation. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief of station in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, has acknowledged involvement in secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airdrops to the Contras at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned military aid to the rebels. <PERSON> Earle </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, declined to comment. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, the attorney representing <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, could not be reached for comment. The process of naming unindicted co-conspirators has come under criticism on the ground that because they are not defendants, they do not have the opportunity to clear themselves in court.

 A bomb exploded at the headquarters of an opposition labor union Saturday, damaging the front of the building, shattering windows and injuring a woman with flying glass, a union leader said. In other developments, authorities found the bodies of six people on a ranch near the capital and blamed the killings on leftist guerrillas. In the eastern city of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> a university official said soldiers destroyed the stage for a music festival and beat several organizers. No one claimed responsibility for the explosion at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, in the northeastern part of the capital. Union leader <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON> said the woman, who lives nearby, suffered minor injuries, he said. <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON> blamed the attack on supporters of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. He said he believed <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed centrist government was trying to intimidate the union on the eve of a march by 50,000 workers planned for Sunday, the country's labor day. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, soldiers destroyed the stage the music festival, surrounded a hotel where foreign artists were staying and beat several organizers of the event and workers building the stage, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> rector <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> <PERSON> Antillon </PERSON> said Saturday. He called the action `` an act of terrorism.'' The festival, called `` A Song for Peace with Sovereignty and Independence in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' began Wednesday in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> square. On Saturday, the last day of the festival, the performances took place in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as planned, in a plaza across from the Metropolitan Cathedral. Among the artists were American singer and composer <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Near </PERSON>; the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group `` Human Condition,'' a Venezuelan group and several Salvadoran groups. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> is about 85 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The armed forces blamed guerrillas for the deaths of four women and two men whose bodies were found Friday night on a ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, 40 miles from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. A military source in the area said the peasants were taken from their homes Thursday by men in olive green uniforms and fatally shot. A red cloth with FPL-FMLN, initials of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was found on one of the victims, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The front is the umbrella organization for five leftist guerrilla groups fighting to overthrow the government. In April, 72 rebels were killed and 47 wounded in combat, the armed forces said Saturday. It said 41 soldiers were killed and 76 wounded. The report blamed the rebels for the deaths of 41 campesinos. It said the rebels wounded 11 others and kidnapped 41 civilians during the month. Nearly 65,000 people have died in the 8-year-old war, the majority of them civilians, according to human rights organizations.

The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said the negotiators had tentatively agreed to meet again May 12-14, but the place has not been determined. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> told a news conference there had been no agreement on when the next session will be held and he said the rebels did not want the talks to resume in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> `` because the climate is not good here.'' He said the rebels refused to sign a joint communique the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had prepared on what was achieved during the last session. Meanwhile, police arrested three more people outside a union hall were 38 workers were in the sixth day of a hunger strike demanding higher wages. The government and rebel leaders met behind closed doors at a <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> hotel in the third and final day of talks to work out details of the March 23 cease-fire pact. The rebel delegation got rid of one of the major stumbling blocks when it agreed to withdraw its demand that combatants be allowed to replace damaged weapons and spent ammunition while they are in special zones. A <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal calls for the rebels to move into seven zones. Once they are concentrated in the areas, the government is to release about 700 political prisoners and allow rebel delegates to take part in national talks with political parties. The Contras on Friday rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal that the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, seen here as sympathizing with the government, immediately resupply the rebels. The cease-fire pact called for delivery of food, clothes and medicine to the Contra combatants only after they entered the zones. Contras say they want to select the organization that will send the goods. The rebels agreed in the pact to accept only non-lethal supplies from a neutral organization. Sandinista police, meanwhile, cordoned off the entrance to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group of anti-government unions and the scene of demonstrations on Friday. About 1,500 construction workers and car mechanics walked off their jobs Feb. 25 to demand higher salaries and protest economic measures enacted a week earlier. Union officials and witnesses said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s Special Forces, known as `` black berets,'' used rubber truncheons to break up demonstrations outside the union headquarters Inside, 38 workers were staging the hunger strike. Witnesses said two men and a woman were taken into police custody Saturday morning for gathering outside the building. Police scuffled with the two men and then roughly tossed them into a pickup truck, the witnesses said. Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, reported Saturday that police detained 25 people during the demonstrations. Eleven others were taken into custody earlier in the week. The newspaper also reported an altercation between Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Osejo </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> anti-Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he was summoned to <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>'s office Friday for allegedly reporting erroneous information about the strike The minister punched him in the mouth, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said. Barricada reported that <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> insulted <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> when the two met in private. `` As a result of the incident, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> suffered minor injuries,'' it said.

 Three sailors who were killed when an explosion and fire filled the submarine USS Bonefish with dense smoke and toxic gas were remembered Saturday as men who knew the cost of freedom. About 500 people gathered for a memorial service for the three who died in the accident in the conventionally powered boat off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast six days earlier. `` We loved these three valiant men,'' said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, to which the Bonefish belonged. `` Thank you God for men like them who know the price of liberty.'' The accident killed Lt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Everts </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Naoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 39; of <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, 21, of <ORGANIZATION> Pisgah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>. A funeral for <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> was held Saturday in <LOCATION> Conroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and services for the other two victims will be held <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>'s mother and brother attended the memorial at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michaels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on the edge of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s historic district, said Lt. Cmdr <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tull </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>. Twenty-two other members of the 92-man crew of the diesel-electric submarine were injured, most by smoke inhalation. The Bonefish was towed back to the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> on Friday. While most of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel in the congregation wore their summer white uniforms, the Bonefish crew dressed in their somber winter blues. `` It is all the men of the Bonefish we honor today,'' said Vice Adm. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> submarine forces. `` The miracle is that 89 men were rescued and the ship returned to port through the heroic, professional and unselfish acts of others,'' he added. Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, commander of <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, praised the crew of the Bonefish, saying `` the spirit and the substance of these people is something that I will always remember.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Chaplain Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Michener </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> family has suffered a loss. `` All of us gathered here are in a very real sense one large family. We are brought together by nothing else than the sea,'' he said. The Bonefish was on a training exercise when it was struck by the explosion and fire in a battery compartment. It was submerged at periscope depth at the time, and the crew quickly surfaced the vessel and evacuated to other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships. There's no timetable for completion of the investigation of the mishap, <PERSON> Tull </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers failed early Sunday to agree on a production cut that analysts said could boost prices, officials said. The oil ministers said they would resume their debate Sunday night. Eight of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 member nations backed a proposed two-month cut of 300,000 barrels a day in the cartel's production that analysts said could raise gasoline prices by 2.5 cents a gallon. But <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON>, the Iranian oil minister, said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and three other <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> states rejected the plan. The Saudis proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> cut only about 200,000 barrels a day, he said. The Saudi idea was rejected by the eight-country majority, and the talks adjourned in the early hours Sunday. The ministers have been meeting since Thursday. `` We're still studying the issue,'' said <PERSON> Hisham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> oil minister, as he left the 3 -LCB- - hour meeting He declined to say more. The other three holdouts are <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, whose oil ministers also have said they needed more time to consult with their governments. The 13th member not voting on the proposal is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which normally does not follow <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s production quotas The Venezuelan oil minister, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisanti </PERSON>, said the cartel leaders were still stuck `` on the same questions.'' `` We are giving time to the four -LRB- gulf <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> -RRB- countries to think again about the proposal,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. Several officials, including <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON>, said the Saudis insisted any cuts in production be shared equally rather than following the usual practice of assigning cuts in accordance with each member's share of current <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production. In other words the Saudis insisted that <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, which pumps only 150,000 barrels a day, cut as much as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which produces 4.3 million barrels daily. Analysts and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> officials said the proposal to cut <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production by 300,000 barrels, or 2 percent, could boost oil prices by as much as $ 1 a barrel, meaning an increase of 2.5 cents per gallon at the gasoline pump. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil currently is selling for $ 14 to $ 16 per 42-gallon barrel, well below its target of $ 18 a barrel. The Saudis' proposal to cut output by 200,000 barrels a day would match the reduction that a group of six non-OPEC producers has offered to make in tandem with the cartel, according to delegation sources. They reported the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> said they would be willing to accept the 300,000 figure if the non-OPEC group raised its cutback offer to that level. The six non-OPEC nations include <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Taken together, the cuts would represent a loss of only about 1 percent of oil supplies in the non-communist world. Normally, a cutback that small would have little or no effect on prices. But analysts said the psychology of the market is such that any agreement on production restraint between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and the non-OPEC group would give at least a modest boost to prices. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a London-based oil consultant, said prices could rise as much as $ 1 a barrel in the very short term. `` It's sheer genius, as far as getting them over the next two months'' when oil markets were expected to be weak, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. By June, oil demand in the industrialized countries is expected to pick up a little, putting less pressure on <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to restrain its production, he said. If the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks ended without agreement, however, prices would be expected to fall sharply, analysts said. The proposed mutual cuts in oil output were easy for most <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members to accept, partly because they are so small and of such short duration that it would be virtually impossible to verify whether any of the cuts were actually made. `` The whole thing is a nonsense'' in terms of actually changing the balance of supply and demand, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders insisted, however, that the proposed cuts would be important. `` If one cuts by -LRB- a combined -RRB- 500,000 barrels a day the market would stabilize,'' <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Tchioba </PERSON>, the oil minister of <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, said in an interview. Other cartel officials acknowledged that the proposed cuts were more imagined than real. `` It's only psychological,'' said one senior <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be further identified. The main aim of the proposal was to establish a precedent for mutual production cuts with the non-OPEC nations. If this could be repeated later, or widened to include more independent producers, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> could have an easier time stabilizing oil prices around its target of $ 18 a barrel.

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has toughened its drug enforcement by allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to seize any boat or ship on which even a small amount of contraband is found, <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said Saturday. Since the policy was enacted April 11, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has confiscated nine vessels _ including a $ 300,000 yacht off the coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ that would not previously have been seized, officials said. A confiscated boat must be returned to its owners only only if allegations of illegal drugs on board are proved to be false. Otherwise, the boat is turned over to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION>, which can sell it at an auction. `` This new policy should be taken as fair warning to anyone who is using or transporting any detectable amount of drugs on our waterways, whether it's in a commercial vessel, a row boat or a million-dollar yacht,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said at a news conference. `` They will not only be prosecuted to the fullest extent of applicable state and federal laws, but will be risking the loss of their property as well.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said the administration now has `` zero tolerance'' toward illegal drug use. The new policy is an extension of the previous strategy of focusing on larger quantities of drugs where there was an intent to deal, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. The tougher policy is an attempt to reduce demand for illegal drugs, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said. He said it is `` based on the notion that when we permit even the smallest drug infraction _ what some still call recreational drug use _ we open the door a bit wider for drug smugglers around the world and for drug users in this country.'' In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, ship owners found in possession of small amounts of drugs often have n't been prosecuted because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office was flooded with bigger drug cases, said Lt. Cmdr <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> district based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Now we will at least be able to take the boats away,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` It should be a deterrent.'' On another front in the government's drug crackdown, customs agents at <LOCATION> Oroville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, on the Canadian border, reported seizing an 18-wheel truck loaded with aluminum Friday after a `` roach clip'' and cigarette papers were found in the truck's cab. The truck, worth about $ 60,000 and owned by a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> company, was the second tractor-trailer confiscated by customs agents in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state this month.

 Metropolitan Opera tenor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, celebrated internationally for his singing of the title role in <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Otello,'' has died at age 61 of complications from a stroke. <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> died Friday night at <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he had been admitted two weeks earlier. A respiratory ailment already had forced him to cancel his performances this month. The tenor appeared at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in December in a concert performance of `` La Fiamma'' and performed as Florestan in `` Fidelio'' in December and January with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> leapt into operatic prominence in 1960 when he sang `` Otello'' to great acclaim in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> debut in 1962 as `` Otello'' was declared a sensation. His dark-timbered, fervent tenor and emotional intensity was well suited to the long and difficult role. It is believed that <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> sang `` Otello'' more often than any tenor in history. He was born Dec. 16, 1926, in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. While in a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> choir, <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> was heard by a music-loving officer who suggested he try for an opera career. With the help of the GI <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, he sang his way through two years of music study at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. His opera debut was as <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> in `` La Boheme'' at the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, Opera in 1952. His Met debut was in a small role in `` La Boheme'' in 1953. He and his wife, mezzo-soprano <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON>, who was singing principal roles at the Met, left for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 1957 so that <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> could further his career. They wrote a book about their experiences, `` A Star in the Family.'' <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON> returned to the Metropolitan Opera in triumph in 1963, becoming the first American native to sing `` Otello'' at the Met. In the 1970s he sang at the Met in `` Aida,'' `` <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>,'' `` Otello'' twice, `` Le Prophete'' and `` Tannhauser.'' The tenor broke with the Met in 1978 because he was n't scheduled for televised performances. He returned and sang at the Met's centennial celebration in 1983 He sang with Leontyne Price in her four farewell performances as `` Aida.'' The last one, in January 1985, was televised. Metropolitan Opera music director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> once said of <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, `` You can count on the fingers of one hand the singers in the world at any time who can sing the roles he sings.'' Director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, while working at the Met, said, `` Only two men in the world can command the stage as he does, -LRB- <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> and -LRB- <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON>.'' Survivors besides his wife include a son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; a daughter, <PERSON> Ahna </PERSON> <PERSON> McCracken-Bogy </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; and a sister, <PERSON> Jeanyellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Straight </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, Ind.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, waving a machete that he called a symbol of the valor of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people, vowed Saturday to keep fighting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to oust him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strongman. `` This machete says, ` Not one step back!''' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told a `` solidarity meeting'' of about 300 Latin American labor leaders. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> brandished the machete several times and people in the crowd cheered and waved machetes they had been given by the government as they entered the conference hall for the closing ceremony. The meeting was organized by pro-government groups. `` This is the machete of Panamanian dignity, of Panamanian valor,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> shouted and the audience chanted, `` Not one step back!'' `` There can be no national or international dialogue, unless the popular forces negotate their own security. This commander is willing to accept a dialogue for the benefit of the popular forces,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said. He claimed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is using <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` as an experimental field'' to develop methods to subjugate other Latin American governments. The steel machetes, engraved with the Panamanian seal, are sold as souvenirs and are very popular. Before entering the hall, the general told reporters he has `` no commitments with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' to quit as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials said Friday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had agreed during recent negotiations with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> to step down as the military commander but rejected <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> insistence that he leave the country immediately after resigning. `` Yes, I had talks with <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> but I have no committments of any kind, no commitments with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> told the reporters. `` If they -LRB- the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- want to be irresponsible, I will not.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents said they were dismayed by the reports that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to a plan that would allow <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> to stay in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> if he resigned as head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the key to his political power. `` It would be a serious mistake if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is allowed to stay in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` He will continue to be a focus of controversy.'' Panamanian officials had earlier acknowledged that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, an aide to Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, but denied that any deal was made. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying since February to oust the general, who is under indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. But he has clung to power despite <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions that have paralyzed the Panamanian economy. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration announced Saturday that it was relaxing some restrictions and would allow Americans to pay utility bills and sales and excise taxes to the government. Payments on corporate and personal income taxes, import duties, port fees and corporate social security payments still are prohibited. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will go out on his terms, when he is ready,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` The Americans are negotiating now from a position of weakness, but they can not back down after publicly demanding that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> step down and leave the country.''

 Hundreds of women who served in the `` Land Army'' that kept British agriculture going during World War II gathered Saturday with Queen <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> to share memories. `` All of us are a little older _ and perhaps a little wiser _ than in those wartime days,'' the 87-year-old former queen told the gathering of 560 women at the Grand Hotel. `` But I know the same spirit of good comradeship, loyalty and devotion to queen and country remains just the same,'' said the queen mother, whose daughter is Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. `` The King and I were proud and grateful to you all for your great contribution to the war effort,'' she said, referring to her late husband, King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>. The women thronged around her, cheering and waving until a path was cleared for her by officers of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION>'s Special Branch who guard the royal family and government. At its height, more than 90,000 women belonged to the `` <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' taking over the farm and forestry jobs left empty when the men went to fight. <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON>, told the queen mother: `` At the time of our service you were our queen and none of us can forget your concern for our welfare.''

<HEAD>Legalization Lines Lengthen As Amnesty Deadline Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Lines of undocumented aliens with hopes for better futures formed outside legalization centers throughout the country, and immigration officials braced for an even bigger onslaught as next week's amnesty deadline neared. `` Monday, Tuesday, it's going to be outrageous,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. An estimated 3,000 people submitted applications at the center Saturday and another 3,500 were expected Sunday, he said. `` The crowd will grow as the deadline approaches,'' <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> said. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act gives aliens who can prove continuous residency in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since Jan. 1, 1982 until midnight Wednesday to apply for legal status. From <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> offices were staying open Saturday and Sunday, and many planned extended hours next week. Officials also were waiving interviews with applicants until after the deadline to cope with the rush. In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, immigration officials staged a party to entice applicants Saturday. Balloons and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags decorated a big room, a calypso singer entertained the crowds, and a disc jockey and a steel band were waiting in the wings. Officials also served refreshments. One <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> native, who said he has lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for 18 years, said he waited until the last minute to apply because he had trouble raising the $ 185 application fee. The fee for children is $ 50, and there is a family ceiling of $ 420. <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonterie </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> legalization officer for <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, said she expected 1,000 people at the office Saturday and again Sunday. Over 100,000 of the estimated 250,000 illegal immigrants in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area are expected to apply by the deadline, she added. The refusal by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week to extend the application deadline to Nov. 30 was spurring the flow of applicants, some officials said. `` They've had a year and they've just procrastinated,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district manager for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, office had more than 100 applicants by 10 a.m. Saturday, <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON> said. About 22,000 people statewide, mostly from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, have applied for citizenship, he added. <PERSON> Moiseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, stood at the <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON> office Saturday with his cousin, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Arevado </PERSON>, who is a citizen. `` Like many Latin Americans, we came here looking for better opportunities,'' said <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, who said he has lived for eight years with his cousin in <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. Three men lined up outside an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> center in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Saturday said they were eager to gain amnesty. `` It's a little safer, and a little relieving,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> security officer who translated for the three Mexican immigrants. `` They wo n't worry about people ... telling them, ` We will call immigration.''' The small office in <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, 150 miles east of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, stopped accepting new applications Friday after being inundated with agricultural workers apparently confused about Wednesday's deadline, acting director <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Callison </PERSON> said Under a special program, agricultural workers have until Nov. 30 to apply for citizenship if they can prove they worked for at least 90 days from May 1985 to May 1986, he said. Some farm employers apparently have started demanding work authorization cards, he added.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Immigration Officials To Stop Harassing Salvadorans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> not to use coercion to keep Salvadoran refugees from applying for political asylum. In a ruling released late Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> granted a petition for a permanent injunction ordering the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to routinely inform all Salvadorans detained that they have a right to ask for political asylum, legal counsel and even access to pay telephones. The ruling reaffirmed a preliminary injunction <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> issued in 1982 in which he ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> routinely threatened Salvadorans to talk them out of their rights. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> attorneys had denied many of the allegations of abuses. Civil rights attorneys hailed the ruling. `` The decision really affirms the fact that Salvadorans with valid claims were simply being denied justice,'' said <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, who helped argue the class-action lawsuit. The government's lead attorney in the case, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON>, criticized the decision, saying it offered sweeping protections to Salvadorans that are not enjoyed by other immigrants. `` How can you say a person from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is less deserving? It's hard to distinguish,'' said <PERSON> Hausman </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The attorney said he did n't know if the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> would appeal. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>'s decision came after a two-year, non-jury trial that featured testimony from 180 witnesses, including many immigrants who said they had been tortured in their native country. The total number of Salvadorans who have applied for asylum was not available, but the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said late last year it was considering about 25,000 applications from Salvadorans in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. More than half of the estimated 750,000 Salvadorans living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. During the 1985 fiscal year, 74 Salvadorans were granted political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 2,229 had their application rejected. During the same period, 2,779 Iranians and 408 Nicaraguans were granted asylum. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration maintains that many of the Salvadorans do not qualify because they are economic immigrants fleeing poverty rather than political refugees fleeing persecution.

<HEAD>200-Foot Sinkhole `A Double Freak,' Geologist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEBRING, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sinkhole that became one of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s largest seems to have stablized with one house at the bottom slowly being covered by water and another home teetered on the edge, a geologist said Saturday `` I call this a double freak sinkhole because it's so far south and it's so big,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a geologist with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinkhole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. `` At least one whole acre has been swallowed up in one big gulp,'' he said. `` It appears to be stable,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, following the typical pattern of sinkholes, which usually stabilize within a day or two after taking anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to collapse. The sinkhole, which collapsed in a subdivision near here Friday evening, is more than 200 feet wide and 15 to 20 feet deep, he said. The average sinkhole in southern central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is about 20 feet across, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` This sinkhole is larger than 99 percent of all other sinkholes in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` It's real gentle,'' said Sebring police Lt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON>. `` It's not a real abrupt hole; it's more like a saucer.'' The sinkhole is becoming a pond since the water table is about 5 or 6 feet below the ground level in that area. The house at the edge of the sinkhole is completely ruined, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` It looks like a drunken sailor,'' he said. `` ... But it does n't look like it's going to get sucked underground like the first house.'' Beyond those houses, neighborhood residents are moving back into their homes, <PERSON> Fennell </PERSON> said. `` It's highly unlikely <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is going to have a rash of sinkholes,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Sinkholes are generally caused by changes in the level of water flowing through limestone and clay formations under the soil. A sudden lowering of the water table caused by irrigation or drought, for instance, can weaken walls and roofs of the underground limestone caverns, leading to their breakdown. Too much water drainage into the ground also creates pressure that can dissolve claylike materials and rock formations underground.

<TEXT>
 The once-in-four-years general conference of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> ended the first lap Saturday of a concentrated exercise in ecclesiastical democracy. Like most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Protestant bodies, the church's organizational system is modeled on the nation's representative system, and the process here provided an intensified example of it. So far, it has been preoccupied with preliminary hearings of legislative committees on a range of proposals, including the status of homosexuals in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and a new hymnbook. Decisions will come next week in the second stage of the 11-day conference, which runs through Friday. The group is the top lawmaking body for the approximately 10 million <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION> in the country, who make up the nation's second-largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination after the Southern Baptists They elect, from their regional units, the 996 national delegates, half laity and half clergy. In a sense, they resemble legislators sent by states to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Somewhat like the Congressional Record, a daily, similar-looking publication, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocate </ORGANIZATION>, provides a verbatim account of general proceedings and a summary of committee deliberations. There is lobbying here, too, including advocates in the <ORGANIZATION> Cervantes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> hallways who passed out buttons and brochures promoting church establishment of a university in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. That project, costing an estimated $ 20 million and to be located in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, was approved by the conference Saturday. As in the secular political realm, the conference's task involves carving out budgets, and a 14 percent increase is being proposed to $ 100 million annually for national operations. That does n't include the approximately $ 2.5 billion given annually for local and regional activities. Alongside the general conference, or legislative branch, the church's approximately 100 area bishops serve as the executive branch, appointing clergy to pastoral or other duties. The church also has 13 national boards or agencies, somewhat like cabinet-level departments. Bishops have no vote at the legislative conference, but are required to be present, address it, and in rotation, preside over it. In addition to the legislative and executive branches, a nine-member judicial council elected by the conference serves as the church's `` supreme court'' to settle disputes over church law or constitution. The council has a rigorous schedule during the general conference. The cost of the gathering: about $ 2.5 million, including the convention hall rental fee, the delegates' air travel and $ 55 each per day for living expenses.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> films that glamorize drugs and challenged the Democrats Saturday to join his call for the death penalty for drug kingpins. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, denying that investigations of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> are hurting his campaign, also warned that if the Democrats `` want to go down the low road, we'll meet them.'' In another development, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions that testimony and documents from a private lawsuit portray top aides to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as being more actively involved in Central American counterinsurgency planning from 1983 to 1986 than previously disclosed. The information, however, does not contradict assertions by senior advisers <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and Col. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that they were unaware until August 1986 of the plan to resupply the Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, the newspaper said. According to the information, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was advised on June 3, 1986 of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s need for spare parts for its helicopters. The memo stressed the need to quickly solve the problem to help <LOCATION> Salvordan </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napolean </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> win the war. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote `` Good!'' on the memo. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> provided the memos and testimony last week during pretrial questioning of witnesses in a $ 24 million civil suit filed by two journalists against 29 people, many of whom figure in the Iran-Contra investigation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a rally in the sunny atrium of a <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> building, called for all Americans to `` stand up against drug use, even casual use, -LRB- and -RRB- express our outrage when we see some in the entertainment industry condoning, almost advocating cocaine as some kind of a modern hip lifestyle.'' In an interview with <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was shocked at the approving way cocaine was presented in a video he and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, rented. He did not name the film. He told the crowd of 300, `` There's much more to do in this fight.'' `` We've appointed tougher judges. We are getting more conviction and longer sentences. But where are the Democrats on mandatory sentencing, on tougher penalties for those who poison our kids with drugs? I favor the death penalty for drug kingpins, those involved in drug-related killings,'' he said. `` If <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are serious about this, let's see where they stand on throwing the book at those who are poisoning the lives of the young people.'' Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> oppose capital punishment for any crime. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` What about those ... who get minors to do their dirty work, their drug-dealing for them? Throw the book at them. Put'em where the sun do n't shine.'' Dr. <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, the secretary of health and human services, voiced pessimism this week about the war on drugs and told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting that the Democrats `` are poised to steal from our party what has been a traditionally Republican issue: law enforcement.'' <ORGANIZATION> Aboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Two </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s polling expert and strategist, said drugs have become an increasingly important issue in voters' minds in the past six months. Voters `` want answers, they want results. They ... do n't want to blame somebody, they want a solution,'' said <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also visited a nursing home in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raphael </LOCATION>'s Home for the Aged, on what was once the estate of his industrialist grandfather, the late <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. There <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the Carmelite nuns and elderly residents, `` I pledge to you that in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, there will be long-term care legislation put on the books.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also took in a spring football scrimmage at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. Before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the vice president rode a river boat across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to mark the bicentennial of that one-time frontier town. Some unemployed steel workers from <LOCATION> Waterford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, carried protest signs and groaned when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke about the 64-month economic recovery. But most of the crowd of 5,000 at the water's edge cheered the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate `` Look, some people in your state are hurting, and so are they in mine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But we have created 15 -LCB- million new jobs since 1982. ... That is progress and we must keep it going until everybody benefits.'' The vice president told <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> reporters he has evidence to throw the `` sleaze'' allegations back in the Democrats' faces, but declined to be specific. He said he is `` keeping my powder dry. ... I want to see the whites of their eyes.'' `` I've heard <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> talk about sleaze. What are they talking about? Who are they talking about?'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Are they convicting someone before the system works?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already clinched the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, but <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> _ which holds its primary Tuesday along with <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> _ will be a key battleground in the fall.

<HEAD>Report: Treatment for Psoriasis Likely to Produce Birth Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new drug for psoriasis is closely related to the acne drug Accutane, and is probably even more likely to produce birth defects when taken by pregnant women, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions that at least seven babies have been born with defects to women who had taken the drug <PERSON> Tegison </PERSON>, though no cases have been been recorded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The drug was licensed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in December 1986, and is used to treat severe cases of psoriasis, whose symptoms include scaly, reddish patches of skin. The newspaper said experts have called for restrictions on the distribution of Tegison like those suggested for Accutane last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tegison </PERSON>, whose generic name is etretinate, can remain dormant in bodily tissues at least two years after it is taken, and can cause birth defects long after a woman stops taking it, Dr. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> told the Times. Tegison is produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Roche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nutley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman-La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> also makes Accutane. `` I think etretinate will be a much bigger problem than Accutane,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Devendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kochhar </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` The number of women exposed will be less, but etretinate is manyfold more toxic than Accutane.'' <PERSON> Tegison </PERSON> carries a pregnancy warning saying that it has not yet been determined how long a woman must avoid pregnancy after taking the drug. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Hoffman-La </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Glynn </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the company was investigating 10 new related compounds for skin treatments. `` So far, pregnancy risk does seem to come with this class of drugs,'' she said. She said the company was considering whether to make the pregnancy warning more prominent on the package. `` Everything we do for Accutane is certainly applicable to <PERSON> Tegison </PERSON>,'' she said. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> endorsed suggestions by the company that it strengthen its warning on Accutane and make it harder for women to obtain. <PERSON> Tegison </PERSON> and Accutane can cause facial deformities, mental retardation and often lethal heart defects in babies born to users of the drug, the newspaper said.

Two undercover <ORGANIZATION> FDLE </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as pilots received $ 4,700 as a down payment on a $ 54,700 contract to steal a helicopter and fly <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> out of the prison, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FDLE </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> asked the undercover agents to have two machine guns and four hand grenades aboard the helicopter, authorities said. He intended to use the grenades to kill his prosecutor, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Moria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasch </PERSON>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FDLE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> was charged with attempted escape and weapons offenses. <PERSON> Stepson </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, a suspected accomplice, was charged with the same offenses but remains at large, authorities said. Longtime friend <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenno </PERSON> said <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> was struggling to cope with prison life when he visited him last summer. `` He was always talking about getting out, that he could n't stand it,'' <PERSON> Fenno </PERSON> said after the escape plan was disclosed Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> in his murder trial, said he was not shocked by the escape plan because under the sentence imposed in April 1987, he would not be eligible for parole before he reached his mid-80s. `` Someone in his position would not have a great deal to lose,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> was convicted of hiring two men who had advertised in Soldier of Fortune to kill his wife, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON>, for $ 20,000. She was bludgeoned to death in November 1985. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Spearman </PERSON> wanted to get rid of his cancer-stricken wife, a former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> assistant city manager, because he had fallen in love with his secretary and did n't want a costly divorce.

<HEAD>Some Crude Flushed Into Open, Easing Part of Cleanup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The wildlife casualty toll from a 175,000-gallon oil spill 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> appeared to have peaked Friday, and gusty winds and high tides helped the cleanup, officials said. `` They are n't picking up many more birds at all now, and we do n't expect to get too many more at all,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Brach </PERSON>. Rescuers have recovered about 470 oil-soaked birds and animals since a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> refinery spilled crude oil into the <PERSON> Peyton </PERSON> <PERSON> Slough </PERSON> on April 23, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, regional patrol chief for the state Fish and Game Department. Of those, about 200 have died or were found dead, he said. Only about a dozen oily birds were brought to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> on Friday, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Podvin </PERSON>. For the second consecutive day, wind and high tides pushed about 1,500 gallons of oil from remote inlets where it had been trapped into open water and marshland. Although the spread could threaten other coastal wildlife sanctuaries, it helped the cleanup, authorities said. `` More and more oil is getting flushed from the marshy areas into the -LRB- <LOCATION> Carquinez </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>, but that's actually working for the most part to our advantage because it's making it easier to pick up,'' said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Eight skimmer boats removed several oil-sheen patches over a 12-mile section of the strait, <PERSON> Brach </PERSON> said. More winds and high tides were expected to continue pushing oil into the strait over the weekend, he added. The crude also has begun to thicken, turning into tar and making cleanup along shorelines easier, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. About 126,000 gallons of the thick crude has been recovered so far, they said. The spill occurred after a pipe used to draw off rainwater broke inside a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> oil tank, allowing crude to be siphoned out, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said. The company acknowledged the practice of keeping outtake valves open during storms violated federal regulations. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, principal engineer fo the state <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, has estimated the spill could cost <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> $ 4 million, including $ 3 million in penalties.

 Two ferries sailed for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Friday to try to break a seamen's strike that threatened delays of up to 18 hours for travelers heading to continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> over a long weekend. About 500 pickets gathered in drizzling rain around midnight -LRB- 7 p.m. EDT -RRB- at the dockside at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, preparing what union leaders promised would be a hostile reception for the two P and O shipping company ferries and their strike-breaking crews. Police reinforcements formed lines in <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> as pickets shouted at truck drivers crossing picket lines to board ferries of the rival Sealink company. P and O refused to give the two ferries' destination or when they would arrive. The confrontation looming between pickets and non-striking crewmen at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the world's busiest ferry port, put Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s union-curbing legislation to its toughest test since her re-election last June. The P and O company's <ORGANIZATION> Pride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> and Pride of <LOCATION> Bruges </LOCATION>, left <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> on a 10-hour voyage to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, crewed by about 280 of the 1,100 employees who accepted new working conditions and opted out of a 3-month-old strike called by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION>. P and O has fired 720 other seamen who rejected the new contract, and many of them manned picket lines at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. Crew members of Sealink have refused for four days to cross the picket lines, forcing Sealink to cut the number of daily round-trip voyages to <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> from 16 to eight and use only French-crewed vessels. With Monday a public holiday, the problems come on one of the travel industry's busiest weekends of the year. Sealink warned motorists of delays of up to six hours, while bus passengers were told they might wait 18 hours. Truckers faced even longer delays, and police cordoned off lanes of the highway into <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> to accommodate stranded vehicles. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s legislation which forbids sympathy strikes has enabled Sealink to seek court seizure of the union's funds. The measure has proved critical in taming militant labor sectors like the coal miners, railwaymen and newspaper printworkers in recent years. But the sequestration of funds could push the seamen into voting for an all-out national strike, and <PERSON> Sealink </PERSON> has appeared at pains to prevent that, stressing that it is not in dispute with its workers and does not want to harm their union. After talks with government mediators Friday, <PERSON> Sealink </PERSON> and union negotiators announced `` a skeleton agreement'' to save Sealink from further disruption and asked to adjourn the hearing until Tuesday. The negotiators said that under the agreement the seamen would confine their pickets to <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Folkestone </LOCATION> and call off the scattered strikes that have broken out at other English and Welsh ports. But later, the deal collapsed over the failure to bring P and O into the peace talks. `` The deal with Sealink is off so far as I am concerned. All Sealink ferries should stay in port,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> McCluskie </PERSON>, leader of the 24,400-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seamen </ORGANIZATION>. Some pickets set fire to a P and O flag and cheered as <PERSON> McCluskie </PERSON> warned the crews in <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>: `` If they stay there as scabs, they will be marked as scabs forever.'' The ferries sailed from <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> despite last-minute efforts by the union to persuade their crews to join the strike. Dutch tugboats ignored the union's pleas to refuse to handle the vessels. Crews of the tugs said their action was saving the company from being sold to foreign owners, that the strike decision was undemocratic and that had they been allowed to vote in a secret postal ballot, they would have abided by the outcome.

<HEAD>Report: Federal Health Insurance Plan Criticized</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The federal employees' health insurance program is inefficient, overpriced and offers inadequate coverage to its 10 million beneficiaries, according to a report presented to the government Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in Saturday's editions that the report to the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> found that the health plan costs $ 785 million more than it should for the benefits it provides and will only get worse unless changed. `` With our huge number of employees, we should be able to get a really good deal,'' said <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>. `` We do n't have a really good deal.

The 28-year-old benefits program has grown to include 480 health plans. The consultants found that those plans compete to attract the healthy and avoid the sick, rather than competing to offer the best benefits at the cheapest rates. The need to attract the healthiest workers means `` no plan can offer high levels of coverage in certain critical areas'' such as mental health, drug abuse or nursing care, the consultants found.

 While Americans debate the pros and cons of a 55-mph speed limit, most West Europeans legally drive much faster than that, and they've been doing so with a lower fatality rate than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. West Germans can go as fast as they want on their highway system known as the autobahn so long as they obey other traffic rules, such as the proper use of directional signals when changing lanes. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, speed limits range from 140 kilometers an hour -LRB- 86.6 mph -RRB- in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to 88 kmph -LRB- 55 mph -RRB- in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, which does not have an extensive superhighway system. The latest statistics of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, for 1986, when a uniform 55-mph limit was still in effect in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, indicate a highway fatality rate of 14.4 per 100,000 population in contrast to 19.9 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that year. The 1986 highway death toll for <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> nations, with a total population of 320 million, was 46,046; in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with a popultion of 242 million, the motor vehicle fatalities numbered 47,900. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more motor vehicles and highways than West Europeans. Americans are driving an estimated 176 million cars, buses and trucks on about 42,500 miles of interstate highways; the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries have an estimated 122 million such vehicles and about 17,800 miles of highways similar to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interstates. This past March, however, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> said traffic fatalities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 1987 were the lowest in history, as measured by 100 million miles of travel. It put the rate by that measurement at 2.4 deaths compared to 2.5 in 1986, 3.3 in 1980 and 24.08 in 1921, the first year the calculation was made. The department attributed the 1987 decline to the increasing use of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving. Seat belts are required in most West European countries, as they are in 32 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> plans to require seat belts by September, 1989. Many European countries also have stiff penalties for drunken driving. Although their highway death tolls have been lower than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, some West European countries are trying to get their own drivers to slow down. In 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> proposed a uniform speed limit of 120 kilometers an hour -LRB- 74.4 mph -RRB- for member nations, but the idea has fallen on deaf ears or has met with outright opposition. `` The federal republic -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- would be the last country to accept any uniform limit,'' said <PERSON> Wolf-Ruediger </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickel </PERSON>, a traffic expert for the state of <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION>. Last year, 693 people died in accidents on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 5,239-mile autobahn system, where multi-car pileups are routine Twenty-three vehicles piled up on Sunday morning, April 10, on an ice-covered stretch near <LOCATION> Schweinfurt </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION>. The fatality toll on all roads in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a nation of 61 million, was 7,973 in 1987, or 13.07 per 100,000 population. While the autobahn system has no overall speed limit, many areas near bridges, construction sites and major cities are posted, often with police enforcement. West German officials also are looking into ways to slow autobahn traffic in areas where accidents are frequent. Traffic engineers in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> are setting up elaborate systems that will bounce beams of light off passing traffic, to measure speed and the number of vehicles on two key stretches of the autobahn. The information will be fed to a computer that will automatically adjust speed limits to conditions and post them in bright lights on electronically equipped traffic signs. Officials in other nations are becoming speed conscious. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has announced a package of measures, including more road signs and speed restrictions, `` to eliminate our own bad driving on motorways.'' Lower speeds at major road construction sites will be mandatory and traffic will be monitored by video equipment, among other measures. The British also plan an experiment on their biggest highway, one linking <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, to see if 70 mph speed-limit signs will help keep drivers from going any faster. About 250 of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 56.4 million people are killed a year on British motorways, as the major highways are called, and more than 8,000 are injured. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, a record 192 people died in traffic fatalities during the 11-day Easter vacation period this year. Only 17 percent, however, were attributed to speeding. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pais </ORGANIZATION>, commenting on the deaths, said <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> needed `` a better developed highway network.'' The Spanish government, however, recently sharply raised the amounts of fines for speeding. On French superhighways, the speed limit is 130 kmph -LRB- 80.6 mph -RRB-, but it is not systematically enforced. In 1987, 479 people died on major highways in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which has a population of 55.2 million. While speed and the difficulty of enforcement remain issues of major concern, Western European countries also provide an array of stiff fines, jail terms and temporary license suspension for drunken drivers. Drunken drivers in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, for instance, have their licenses seized by police on the spot. Courts decide later when they get them back. First-time drunken drivers face fines of as much as 1,000 guilders -LRB- $ 535 -RRB- in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Swedish police frequently stopped post-midnight traffic on weekends and administer blood tests on the spot to measure alcohol in a driver's system. The French National Assembly in July passed a law doubling jail terms for drunken driving to a range of two months to two years. Some <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> cities offer shuttle bus service to keep young people from driving after a night at discotheques. The West German magazine <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> recently published a cover story on the highway accident toll involving young people who had been partying all night. `` Almost every second car was driving too fast, and alcohol played a role in every third case,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. `` The recommendation of the accident researchers: ` Let the girls do the driving. At this age -LRB- 18 to 24 -RRB-, girls are the better drivers.'''

 When <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> closed his failing robotics firm in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he never imagined that six months later he would be making plows and harnesses in the African <PERSON> bush </PERSON> as a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> volunteer. `` For a man my age, opportunities were limited and I was disillusioned,'' said the 66-year-old electrical engineer. `` But I was not ready to retire. I had too much to offer.'' Two years after arriving in this East African nation, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> is working to open a training center to mass produce inexpensive plows and harnesses for peasant farmers with U.S.-government money and land donated by the Kenyan government. He expects to open the <ORGANIZATION> Mutomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> by January with an class of 100 students. The <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> nearly $ 300,000 to build the center and the Kenyan government donated a seven-acre site. The enterprises program is financed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> USAID </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- through <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to help set up small businesses in rural areas. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who comes from <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, left <ORGANIZATION> Marquette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, in 1951 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He worked as a design engineer, managed a computer chips manufacturing company and helped various companies automate their operations before establishing his own company, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1983. He closed the business in January 1986, when the economy turned sour. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, a widower, said `` the children had gone their seperate ways,'' so he decided to strike out on his own. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, an organization usually staffed by people a third his age. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> in July, 1986, and eventually wound up in <LOCATION> Mutomo </LOCATION>, a market town of fewer than 1,000 people 140 miles southeast of the capital, <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. There, the <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had asked other donor governments to help find someone to run a small operation making harnesses and plows. `` I wondered what a man trained in electronics and used to big plants would do here,'' recalled <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, a stocky, balding man. He spent 10 weeks at the lakeside town of <LOCATION> Naivasha </LOCATION> for orientation before coming to <PERSON> Mutomo </PERSON> about 18 months ago. He found workers turning out crude plows and harnesses by hand. `` I was astounded,'' he said. `` The men sat on dirt floors hacking away at wood with pangas -LRB- machetes -RRB- and producing beautiful frames for harnesses.'' He intends to introduce shop tools and power tools to the process so the men can make more harnesses and plows at a faster rate. Days are hot and nights chilly in <LOCATION> Mutomo </LOCATION>, which sits in the middle of scrubland, rock outcrops and gulleys left by torrential rains that come twice a year. Peasants of the <LOCATION> Kamba </LOCATION> tribe, mainly women and children because men seek fortunes elsewhere, try to grow corn, sorghum and millet. They also graze goats and cattle and keep donkeys. But they lack affordable tools, particularly plows. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> pushed the idea for a training center, writing proposals and seeking money. <PERSON> Josephat </PERSON> <PERSON> Muliungi </PERSON>, development coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Kitui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diocese </ORGANIZATION>, said the center will be the largest economic enterprise in <LOCATION> Mutomo </LOCATION>. The area is one of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s poorest; average income for a peasant farm family is less than $ 100 a year. `` Once the students are gainfully employed, we expect a sizeable increase in income for at least 1,000 families within a year,'' <PERSON> Muliungi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said the center will continue making harnesses and plows but in larger quantities and better quality. He hopes to reduce the price of a plow from the current 450 shillings -LRB- $ 26.50 -RRB-. Only 20 of the 100 students will remain at the center after the year-long training. The others will be organized into groups, given a little money and sent out to make and repair plows and harnesses in the villages around <LOCATION> Mutomo </LOCATION>. The center will continue to offer advise on how to run simple businesses. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> already is looking to expand production to include hand tools, bicycles, carts and solar-powered radios. `` People say it can not be done,'' he said. `` But I think it can be done. It is possible.'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> stint has been extended by a year, said the center can be duplicated in other parts of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and wants to stay after his Peace Corps time is up. `` It is a beautiful thing what I'm doing here,'' he said. `` And it's good for people like me. `` I'm young again. I'm thinking again.''

 Friday is the best, and worst, day of the week for <PERSON> Socorro </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, a maquiladora mother. She is one of the thousands of <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> women now able to earn their own livelihoods working in the foreign-owned assembly plants in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> known as maquiladoras. Maquiladoras have made life better for most of them, but for others it is still difficult to shake off all of the hard times the left behind. It is that way for <PERSON> Socorro </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, just as Friday is her best day and her worst day. When the whir of the plant's sewing machines stops at 5:30 p.m. on Fridays, Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> catches a bus for downtown, then another that takes her to a children's home. It's a two-hour journey across town for a weekly reunion with her two children, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON>, 14, and <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, 10, who stay at the home while she works. That is the best part of Friday, taking the children to her own small apartment for the weekend. The worst part is seeing how the children are outgrowing their clothes and dodging the landlady who is asking her to vacate the apartment. Then, there's shopping for wholesome food. `` The week I have to pay the rent, we do n't buy food,'' the 34-year-old mother says. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>'s husband went to work `` temporarily'' as an illegal alien in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 10 years ago. He wrote and sent money home the first year. The frequency of the letters dropped off and finally stopped. He never returned. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>, who has just a fifth grade education, moved her family from the small <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> state town of <LOCATION> Namiquipa </LOCATION> to the state capital, the city of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, and worked five years there as a seamstress. But, she said, `` I just could n't make it on what I earned. Sometimes I would put the children to bed without dinner. `` We did n't have heat so I would borrow the neighbor's iron, and iron the bed to get it warm,'' she said. In that way, life has improved for Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> and her children since they stepped off the bus two years ago in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, a city of 1.1 million people just across the border from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> got a job the day after she arrived as a seamstress in a maquiladora, which makes goods for export, mostly across the border to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For maquiladora owners, the advantage is <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s low wages; for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, it is jobs for its people and increased export income for its coffers. Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> makes about 80,000 pesos a week, nearly $ 35 at an average exchange rate of 2,300 pesos to the dollar. Her job is stitching sections of leather work gloves at <LOCATION> Wellmax </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based glove manufacturer <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON>. Her pay is double the mimimum wage in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> and more than triple what she had earned for similar work in <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. Instead of the one-room apartment she and her children had in <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, they now have two rooms, two beds and some used furniture she bought with money she saved from her earnings. By staying at the home, the children do n't have to spend their after-school hours in an employee cafeteria waiting for her to finish work as they did before. `` My boss worked hard to help me find a place so the children could be together during the week,'' she said. But, she added, `` Sometimes I get so lonely for them that I go there and sleep.'' <PERSON> Wellmex </PERSON> is one of about 200 foreign-owned maquiladoras in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>. More than 330,000 people, the majority of them women, work in the maquiladora industry that now vies with tourism as the country's No. 2 source of foreign exchange for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> after petroleum. Another maquiladora mother at <LOCATION> Wellmax </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemus </PERSON>, second-born in a family of 17 children. Things now are much better for her and much less difficult than they are for Ms. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>. In Ms. <PERSON> Lemus </PERSON>' past life is her father working 30 years as a cook in a <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> restaurant while her mother stayed home to care for the children in a two-room adobe hut. `` My mother would cry because we did n't have money for food,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Lemus </PERSON>, now 33. At age 15 she dropped out of junior high school in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> to work at cleaning a curios shop. She earned $ 5 a week. `` I had to stop studying to help my parents pay for the other kids,'' she said. When <PERSON> Wellmex </PERSON> opened, she applied for a job. She has worked her way up from seamstress to production manager. `` With the education I have, if it were n't for the maquiladoras I'd be working as a maid in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Lemus </PERSON> met her husband at <LOCATION> Wellmex </LOCATION> and he is now a plant maintenance supervisor. The couple is rearing two children on a combined net income of nearly 300,000 pesos a week, about $ 130. They own a car and a three-bedroom, middle-class home they got through the government's low-cost housing program, <ORGANIZATION> Infonavit </ORGANIZATION>. `` Things are a lot easier now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lemus </PERSON> said. `` I do n't have to worry whether the kids have hot food. `` And they're getting an education. That's the most important thing.''

 Heading north out of town past farms and pine stands, one might never notice the Overcomer Campground _ until recently, when television news vans began clustering at the headquarters of evangelist R.G. Stair's ministry. The attention follows reports by families in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area that their children have abandoned their lives for a Christian cult, and their allegations that cult members ca n't leave because <ORGANIZATION> Stair </ORGANIZATION> controls their money. The allegations are denied by <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>, a 51-year-old <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> native who, like other members of the Faith Cathedral Fellowship, lives in a renovated mobile home set among the tall oaks and pines near this town about 50 miles from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` We have a good lifestyle here,'' he said. `` We believe in the Christian principle of having food and raiment, be content.'' The ministry is headquartered in a nondescript brown-roofed motel building along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 15. Beside it is a modest brown building, which is the congregation's tabernacle. Worshippers sit on folding white wood chairs each Friday evening and Saturday morning to hear <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>'s sermons of Bible prophecy delivered from a podium on a red-carpeted riser. Behind the podium is a small room in which the evangelist records his radio programs carried on 50 stations nationwide. A few miles farther north is the sect's 74-acre farm, where 37 people are busy farming and renovating house trailers. The farm has a five-acre plot where residents raise everything from turnips to squash and watermelon. Nearby are a kitchen and dining hall where residents gather for prayers and share their meals. Despite the allegations the group espouses survivalism, there's no indication of any weapons or military dress among the residents of the ministry, where a sign requests there be `` No Smoking, No Drinking and No Swearing. A number have their own bank accounts and vehicles. There is no fence, but a free-standing gate at the motel keeps cars from swerving into the parking lot at night. Visitors can stay without charge, but there are some requirements for those who want to stay permanently, <PERSON> Stair </PERSON> said. `` We want to make sure they believe in the Christian faith like we do,'' he said. They must also be debt-free, because `` it's not right for me to take other people's money and pay your debts,'' he added. The ministry takes in about $ 30,000 a month, <PERSON> Stair </PERSON> said, adding he pays about $ 20,000 monthly for radio air time. Since the challenges to his ministry were raised, several stations have taken the fiery Overcomer broadcast off the air. <PERSON> Stair </PERSON> has predicted that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wo n't complete his term in office, there'll be an economic shakeup beginning next month and there'll be a limited nuclear war before the year is out. `` I believe God speaks to me,'' he said in a broadcast prepared for this weekend. `` That's one of the issues they have taken up with me. But how many of you Christians out there in radio land believe <PERSON> God </PERSON> speaks to you?'' <PERSON> Stair </PERSON> said the religious community is not a survivalist enclave, noting `` we've got a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base over there -LRB- in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> -RRB- with submarines. If they're going to blow us up, they're going to blow us up. There is no human protection from a nuclear war.'' The sect does have a food storehouse, stocked with several thousand pounds of food. It's for the congregation's use and is also given away to the needy. <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>, who is called <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Stair </PERSON> by the congregation, was ordained a Methodist minister. Now, he said, `` I wo n't identify with any organized religion. I just call myself a Christian.'' He said the Lord told him to move <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> 30 years ago `` because the safest place for Christians in the end time is going to be the South.'' He has lived in <LOCATION> Walterboro </LOCATION> for 10 years. Much of the recent controversy has centered on the move of <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> McCourt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Drexel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, to the community. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> McCourt </PERSON>'s mother, said <PERSON> Stair </PERSON>'s prophecy of a nuclear war inspired them to quickly sell their home and belongings and head to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. She and others in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area have called for investigations by the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. But Mrs. <PERSON> McCourt </PERSON> said, `` We just wanted to move to a quieter place.'' She said the couple had planned to sell their house and, when a buyer offered them $ 60,000 cash, they decided to take it. Real estate agents had earlier offered to list the house for $ 74,000 and $ 65,000, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> McCourt </PERSON>, who is expecting her second child in June, said she leads a different life from her mother. She said she and her husband do n't watch television or go to movies and on vacations were likely to go to Christian retreats. She said when she arrived in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, she called home to let her mother know where the family was. `` All she kept saying was, ` You're sick,''' she said. `` There was no having a conversation.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> McCourt </PERSON> said her mother is welcome to visit. `` I wish she would come down here. We have no malice.'' <PERSON> Stair </PERSON> said that if his critics in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> were to visit, `` There would be no question of whether I'm making their people stay here or not.

 <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> knows that if its $ 3.9 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Rowntree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> is successful, it will have immediate access to the masses of consumers who chomp down 30 million Kit Kat bars every week. Rather than going to its own kitchen and tinkering with new recipes to tempt the average sweet tooth, Swiss-based <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> will rely on <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON>'s tried-and-true formulae for <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Kat </PERSON>, the world's second best selling chocolate product, and other candy favorites like After Eight mints and <PERSON> Rollos </PERSON> As the takeover epidemic spreads to consumer product companies, these firms find buying a successful product rather than trying to invent one is cheaper and the fastest way to the customer. But some experts wonder whether product research and innovation will fall by the wayside as this latest strategy for gaining market share takes hold. Recently on the takeover scene, the same rationale of buying into success was the driving force for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which will acquire state-of-the-art sheet and towel plants as well as hot designer brand names through its $ 1.22 billion acquisition of rival textile maker <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. And <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the French luxury products concern, unveiled plans to acquire a controlling interest in two Swiss watchmakers, a move that ensures it will control 40 percent of the international market for expensive watches Even <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> recently decided to buy into the gas stove market by acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, rather than go out and set up its own gas range operation. `` GE has all the resources to compete and develop new products and break into new markets, but it's cheaper to do it through the stock market,'' noted <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Margotta </PERSON>, an assistant professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The cost of introducing a new product that will appeal to a broad public palate is extremely high. `` Definitely in today's market, entry is very expensive,'' said <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON>, a professor of finance at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> A product like computer software, for example, has a narrowly defined target market, making it possible to start at the fringes of the market and gradually build up interest. `` But with consumer products, it does n't work that way,'' <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON> said. `` You have to implement a full-fledged ad campaign for any product you want to place on the shelf. Spreading the word is much costlier when you're talking about every household, rather than the 5 percent of households that use computer spreadsheets.'' A consumer product `` is only as good as when it reaches the consumer,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisgelin </PERSON>, an international food and beverage analyst at the securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` And it's only good if it has high volume. The hit is a combination of a few things _ a good product, good marketing ... and good distribution,'' he said. In the case of <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, whose bid for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Rowntree </PERSON> this past week challenged a competing offer from <ORGANIZATION> Jacobs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, success would be guaranteed. `` The main positive for <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> is to go from low market share in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> to a 20-25 percent share overnight,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisgelin </PERSON> said. `` To achieve that otherwise would require money and years'' of product development and positioning. Some estimates have put the consumer product failure rate as high as 95 percent. But marketing experts continue to refine the figure based on when a product is labeled a bust _ whether that occurs while an idea is still on the drawing board, after a prototype product gets to a shelf, or somewhere in between. A majority of products that get to the commercial launch stage actually do manage to survive, experts say. But developing a trusted brand name takes years of nurturing. Some experts fear what the takeover trend might mean for product development efforts and quality control. Companies may find it `` worthwhile to delay the introduction of technology and milk profits if they have a stranglehold on the market,'' <PERSON> Margotta </PERSON> said. In addition, employees who are `` involved for 20, 30 years in creating high-quality products can be the very people thrown out in a takeover,'' he said. But <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Boisgelin </PERSON> disagrees. He contends mergers could increase product innovation because `` the bigger you are, the more money you can spend on <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; D.'' Experts say consumers will be little affected by the recent acquisitions of companies selling every-day products. <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> sheets will still be available at the local department store, regardless of whether <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> or <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is making them.

 While the companies initiating takeovers are sure to reap some savings by consolidating operations like administration, accounting and even distribution, those savings are n't likely to be passed on to the consumer. Instead, experts say, companies with a commanding share of the market might even be in a position to boost prices. `` I do n't think the consumer will be directly affected immediately,'' <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON> said. `` The benefit will be for shareholders, not consumers.'' According to economic reports this past week: _ The government's chief forecasting gauge of future economic activity shot up 0.8 percent in March, pointing to continued growth for the rest of the year _ Americans' personal incomes posted the biggest gain last month since December, while consumer spending jumped a healthy 0.7 percent _ Strong consumer spending helped the nation's economy grow at a healthy 2.3 percent annual rate during the first three months of 1988 _ Sales of new single-family homes rose 4 percent in March, the second consecutive monthly improvement following a post-stock crash slump Sales of existing homes edged up 2.5 percent in March for the second month in a row. _ Wage and benefit increases for the 12 months ended in March averaged 4.1 percent, compared with 3.4 percent during the previous 12 months _ Employment in manufacturing businesses fell by 4 percent between 1982 and 1986, but transportation equipment, plastics and furniture continue to draw workers _ Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks rose slightly in mid-April to 353,314 units, from 308,240 units in the year-ago last year In other economic and economic news: _ The <ORGANIZATION>

 In their search for some likely event to break the recent stalemate in the stock market, many analysts are looking to next Friday's report on employment. Wall Streeters expect the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> data to set the tone for the numerous other statistics on the economy for April that will be issued over the next several weeks. They also believe the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will take a close look at the numbers as it considers what monetary policies it should pursue. Public notice focuses most directly on the unemployment rate, which dropped to 5.6 percent in March, hitting its lowest level since July 1979. Participants in the securities markets, however, pay more attention to other elements of the report _ for instance, the net change in what the government calls `` non-farm payrolls.'' This number is closely watched as a gauge of the economy's overall strength _ and of the prospective outlook for interest rates and inflation Thus, while strong growth in employment is a positive for consumer spending and near-term corporate profits, it is also viewed as a potential negative for stock prices. Payroll employment grew by a larger-than-expected 262,000 workers in March. `` Recent trends in initial claims for unemployment insurance suggest that the April non-farm payroll gain will be at least 200,000,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In Held's appraisal, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would like to see strength in the economy concentrated in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing jobs registered a slight decline in March. By now, many followers of the securities markets are used to the `` good news is bad news'' reasoning that Wall Street often applies to statistics such as the employment figures. Nevertheless, even hardened veterans of the game acknowledge there is something dramatic right now in the difference between the apparently robust state of the economy and the rampant pessimism in the markets. `` Catatonic ... paralyzed ... numb could all be used to describe the average investor in recent months,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON> in his advisory letter InvesTech. `` Those who are out of the market are too terrified of another crash to step in. Investors who were heavily invested in the crash are just as afraid of not recouping their losses if they jump out now.'' In the past week, which produced some of the quietest trading days of the year to date, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials managed a 17.24 gain to 2,032.33. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 1.30 to 148.33; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market increased 5.20 to 379.24; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index gained 5.11 to 303.14. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 141.47 million shares a day, down from 155.02 million the week before. From the mid-1960s through the mid -'80s, May and June acquired a well-earned reputation as a perilous period for stock prices, with numerous and sometimes sharp <PERSON> Yale </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, publisher of the Stock Trader's Almanac, dubbed it the `` May-June disaster area.'' But whether this pattern was a product of mere coincidence or the result of some force undiscernable to the ordinary mortal, it seems to have been broken in the last three years. From the end of April to the end of June, the Dow Jones industrials rose 6.2 percent in 1985; 6.1 percent in 1986, and 5.8 percent in 1987, according to <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>'s reckoning.

<HEAD>Congress Turns Spotlight on `Junk' Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> turned its spotlight of scrutiny on `` junk'' bonds this past week, and the head of the investment firm that pioneered the controversial issues defended them staunchly. In 6 -LCB- hours of testimony Thursday before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigative subcommittee, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also defended the firm against allegations of manipulation of the $ 160 billion junk bond market. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, a leading Wall Street investment firm, is the granddaddy of the high-yield, high-risk bonds and underwrites around 40 percent of all junk bonds issued. The securities are designed to allow companies without a track record of earnings to get financing based on whether they have sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts. They pay higher interest rates than those of established companies and are viewed as riskier investments. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond trading unit in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who pioneered the bonds, was a lot less talkative than <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> at a hearing Wednesday before the investigations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who has been under investigation for the past year and a half by a federal grand jury that is reported to be probing insider trading, refused to testify and cited his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. Behind the spotlight, the junk bond market seems to have quietly risen like a phoenix from the ashes of the October stock market collapse, as worries about a recession have subsided. The resurgence of corporate `` takeover fever'' earlier this year also gave junk bonds a shot in the arm, since many of the issues are used to finance acquisitions. Some of the companies that have used junk bond financing, such as businesses in the steel and chemical industries, have performed well recently _ helped by a weaker dollar that made their exports more attractive. After the crash, there had been concern that failures of vulnerable companies could cast a shadow on the junk bond market. `` There's an ongoing need for high-yield securities,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waill </PERSON>, a managing director of investment firm <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the head of its junk bond research department. <PERSON> Waill </PERSON> believes more funds will be attracted to junk bonds in the coming months, as investors switch big sums of money now parked in money-market funds into high-yield mutual funds featuring junk bonds. The money-market funds, based on prevailing interest rates on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, have been yielding relatively low returns recently. Junk bonds are purchased mainly by big financial institutions, and most individual investors buy them through high-yield mutual funds. The bad publicity now surrounding the bonds _ with congressional investigators portraying <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> as a greedy firm that elbowed its own clients aside so top employees could profit on hot new issues _ wo n't hurt the market, traders insist. `` This has been going on for 18 months; it's a little anti-climactic by now,'' <PERSON> Waill </PERSON> said, referring to investigations of junk bond trading and the congressional hearings. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel he expects the junk bond market to expand substantially over the next 10 years, since less than 10 percent of the companies that could get financing by issuing the high-yield bonds have done so. In the last 10 years, the market has grown explosively, from less than $ 25 billion in junk bonds in 1977 to around $ 160 billion last year _ or 25 percent of the $ 650 billion corporate debt market. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> pointed to cable television as an example of an industry ripe for the bonds, saying cable companies tend to have low earnings because of their high investment costs initially but also have great profit potential. The average company issuing junk bonds is about 36 years old, has around $ 1 billion in assets and employs more than 4,000 people, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> says.

 A double dose of good economic news failed to inspire the nation's financial markets, which worried more about inflation and ended the week by heading down. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that its Index of Leading Indicators rose 0.8 percent in March, the second straight big monthly gain. Some economists said the figure eliminated chances of a recession in 1988 and thereby boosted the Republican chances for winning the presidential election. New home sales also rose in March for the second straight month, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The 4 percent gain strengthened arguments that the housing industry has revived following a slump in the aftermath of the October stock market crash. Nevertheless, some analysts said the sales level could fade later this year because of rising mortgage rates, a consequence of a slow upward move in interest rates over the past several weeks. Others said economic strength also means a probable rise in inflation, which could compel the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit conditions. It is the rise in inflation that worries investors in the stock and bond markets, which largely ignored the news on the economy Friday and instead retreated. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 8.95 points to 2,032.33. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation and interest rate trends, the key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond lost about $ 1.25 in face amount, and its yield edged up slightly to 9.09 percent. The economic news helped the value of the dollar, which rose slightly against most key currencies. But some traders said the dollar's behavior also was a reaction to the evidence of rising interest rates, which makes dollar-denominated assets more valuable.

 Oil futures prices sagged then bounced back in nervous trading that reflected the uncertain outcome of a key <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a sensitive barometer of price trends, traders remained wary Friday of guessing results of the meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> ministers in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. The ministers were trying to develop a strategy to jointly reduce output with eight non-OPEC producers in order to erase excess supplies from the market. Contracts for June delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed 1 cent higher at $ 17.99 per 42-gallon barrel Friday, after having been down as much as 43 cents. Among refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.16 cent per gallon to 51.67 cents, and wholesale heating oil rose 0.82 cent a gallon to 51.79 cents. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, a strategist at the <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> commodities firm, said oil prices dropped sharply early in the session because of what he called carryover selling from Thursday over the lack of significant news from the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting. After prices fell so quickly, some traders saw buying opportunities and the market quickly moved up. That prompted other traders who had sold borrowed oil on the hunch prices would fall to buy it back, a price-boosting influence known as short-covering. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, called the late-session bounceback a `` pre-weekend, short-covering rally.''
