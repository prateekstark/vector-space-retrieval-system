 The night before <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s adoptive 6-year-old daughter was removed unconscious from their apartment, his live-in companion said she heard noises in a bedroom `` like <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> throwing <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>,'' sources said Monday. <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> told a psychiatrist at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 20 that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who is accused of beating <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> to death, then handed the child to her, saying, `` This is your child; what have you done; this has gone far enough,'' <ORGANIZATION> WCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> said Monday, quoting from a copy of the unidentified psychiatrist's report. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the contents of the report through sources close to the case. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> told the psychiatrist that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was angry that night because <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> refused to drink water after he had given her and <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> hot pepper. She said he gave them the hot pepper to get them to drink more water. She later heard noises from the bedroom that sounded `` like <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> throwing <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>,'' the report said. Afterward, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> gave the child to <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, who placed her on the floor and noticed water and food coming out of her mouth. The report said that <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> thought <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> may have poured water down <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s mouth and that she was drowning. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said she then began pumping the child's chest. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> told the psychiatrist that <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had left the apartment shortly afterward and returned about 10 p.m.. At about 6 a.m. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said, `` She's stopped breathing'' and told <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> to `` call 911. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, a former editor of children's books, also was charged with <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s murder, but the charges against her later were dropped. She has spent the last year undergoing physical and psychiatric rehabilitation for injuries the prosecution says she suffered at <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s hands. At <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s trial on Monday a photographer testified that he used poses and lighting tricks to hide bruises he saw on the battered child when he took pictures of her in school two weeks before she was found dead. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, working that day for <ORGANIZATION> Scholastic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, said he initially was reluctant to photograph the first-grader when he visited her school on Oct. 22, 1987, because of her numerous bruises and her unkempt appearance. `` I observed some bruises underneath her left eye, by the cheeks, a bump on the forehead and underneath the chin here, a bruise, and some bruises on her arms,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. `` The hair was very unkempt ... uneven,'' and her clothes were `` very rumpled, dirty,'' he said. <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said he eventually took several black and white pictures of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. He said he was drawn to her when she began directing two other children on posing the way he wanted them. `` She seemed older, more mature,'' he said. `` I put her on the right side and I flooded my light into her and I had her turn her head this way and down so you would n't see it. The last thing my client wants to see is bruises,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. He said the rumpled and dirty quality of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s clothing also was eliminated `` in the way I photographed them.'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, is charged with murder for allegedly beating <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> to death. The disbarred lawyer denies that he hit the child. He says she fell unconscious after choking on food she had vomited. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was taken unconscious from <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment early on Nov. 2, 1987, and died three days later at a hospital. Prosecutors are trying to show by Gross' photographs and testimony that <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> was an abused child in the weeks before her death. They hope to eliminate any reasonable inference except that the abuse was inflicted by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who illegally adopted the girl.

<HEAD>South Korea's Roh Indicates He May Pardon Chun, Who Prepares

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> was quoted as saying Monday that he wants to resolve politically the controversy raging over his predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, an indication he may pardon <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> is preparing to apologize for corruption and other misdeeds before moving into rural exile. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said his government hopes to resolve the controversy over <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> by the end of this year. The former president is being forced out of the capital, <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, by militant students who rioted and tried to break into his home, demanding that he be arrested and punished for alleged corruption and other abuses during seven years of authoritarian rule. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an interview with the national daily <ORGANIZATION> Shinmun </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-government newspaper published in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>: `` In handling past wrongdoings, a clear distinction must be made between those -LRB- wrongdoings -RRB- to be dealt with judicially and those to be dealt with politically ... Any wrongdoings by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> as chief executive of the country should be dealt with politically and there should not be political reprisal against the former chief executive ... `` I will take actions under the principle that any wrongdoings by a chief executive should be dealt with politically and that any political reprisal would only hurt democratic development.'' He made the remarks as the 56-year-old <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> reportedly was preparing to make a nationally televised apology Wednesday. Newspapers said <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> also is to turn over most of his wealth to the government and accept rural exile, a traditional way of repentance for a disgraced Korean. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> originally planned to leave <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Tuesday, but was delayed because of difficulty finding him a safe rural home, news reports said. The former president, who stepped down in February, denies personal wrongdoing. However, about a dozen of his relatives and associates were convicted or charged with corruption involving millions of dollars in public funds. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> needs a refuge from attack. Some reports said he would go to a mountainside Buddhist temple near an army unit in the north. Others said he might move to central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He reportedly is unwelcome in his southern hometown. National Assembly hearings Monday on abuses under the Chun government focused on attempts to stifle press freedom. More than 700 journalists were fired under government pressure and many newspapers and broadcast operations were merged and placed under state control by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s administration. In recent weeks, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has been a virtual prisoner in his luxurious <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> home, guarded by hundreds of riot police to prevent attacks by dissidents. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government has been accused of trying to protect <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and is trying to defuse public anger without being implicated in the furor. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former army general, took power with military backing in 1980. He was succeeded by <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, another former general and close associate, after presidential elections last December.

<DATELINE>FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 They call it `` The Castle,'' a massive stone building with eight wings radiating from a central six-story rotunda. The wings hold eight tiers of cells, stacked one upon the other, and in each 8-by-10-foot cell an inmate is allowed a cot, a table and a chair. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disciplinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION> is the biggest military prison in the nation. It is a grim home for about 1,450 inmates, sent here from bases all over the world, wherever American military men and women are stationed. Forty-two officers, including one lieutenant colonel, and 21 women are serving time here. Among them are drug dealers, armed robbers, rapists, murderers and spies. More than 80 are serving life terms. Three inmates are on death row. And there is strict military discipline. `` Our rules are so strict that if a guy turns left and he knows he's not supposed to turn left, he's in trouble,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasko </PERSON>, prison chief of staff. `` You earn what you get here,'' added the prison commandant, Col. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrong </PERSON>, a former Army airborne Ranger and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran. `` There are n't any free lunches.'' Military officials say the goal of the prison is not just confinement, but correction. `` Unfortunately, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today we do a lot of confining and not much correction,'' <PERSON> Gasko </PERSON> said. `` We attempt to give them tools so when they leave here, they can be productive citizens.'' When inmates leave these walls, they return to civilian life, not to the military. Next to discipline, training is the top priority at the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION> prison, which has more than 20 vocational programs including automotive repairs, printing, carpentry, upholstery, and hotel and restaurant management. Inmates, whom officials would not allow to be interviewed, even repair cars and furniture of military families living at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>. Officials claim the Disciplinary Barracks has the oldest shoe repair business west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, started in 1877 to make boots for cavalrymen. Now it repairs everything from prescription orthopedic shoes to cleated golf shoes, <PERSON> Gasko </PERSON> said. The prison also has one of the largest silk-screening businesses in the nation, providing all the decals for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> planes. Congress authorized the prison's construction in 1874. An old quartermaster depot that had supplied military posts in the Indian Territory housed the first prisoners. The Castle was completed in 1915 by inmate labor. Inmate labor is still used for maintenance, but the prisoners also work with their minds. Most have high school diplomas, and those who do n't go straight into the classroom when they arrive, <PERSON> Gasko </PERSON> said. They can earn associate and bachelor's degrees through correspondence, and a few are working on master's degrees, but <PERSON> Gasko </PERSON> said they do that at their own expense. The prison takes enlisted men from all branches of the service except the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. It takes all convicted officers, regardless of the length of the sentence. <PERSON> Gasko </PERSON> said the shortest sentence for an officer he recalls is seven days. `` I think they wanted him to see the inside of a prison,'' he said. One inmate is going into his 17th year, he added. Some famous inmates have seen the inside of its walls, from Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Calley </PERSON>, who was convicted of murdering Vietnamese civilians at My Lai, to <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> who was convicted of espionage while an embassy guard in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Three inmates are awaiting death sentence, although the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has not executed anyone since 1961 and no execution dates have been set. They are: _ <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who was sentenced last April in connection with the death of two women. He was stationed at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 24, of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who was convicted last year of murdering his wife, his 6-year-old stepson, and his 2-year-old son, while stationed in <LOCATION> Nanau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, 22, a Marine from <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, who was convicted in August 1987 of murdering his platoon commander and platoon commander's wife at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lejeune </LOCATION>. Although most inmates are first-time offenders, the average sentence is about 10 years. About two-thirds are serving time for such crimes as assault, rape, murder or kidnapping; 17 percent are imprisoned for narcotics violations, and 11 percent were sentenced for theft. No inmate is serving time for just a military offense, such as being absent without leave. Some prisoners work outside the walls and in nearby <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION> on work-release programs. About 20 inmates work on the 2,600-acre prison farm, which raises hogs and cattle and grows row crops and vegetables. Outside The Castle walls, inmates who are `` installation parolees'' stay in an unsecure barracks. They have proved themeselves reliable while doing their time, and have earned a few extra privleges. `` The only thing that keeps them out there is moral restraint,'' <PERSON> Gasko </PERSON> said. `` But the rules are extremely tough, and we do n't tolerate any violations.

<TEXT>
 Evening campfires in the nomads' camelhide tents dance to a nightly staccato of gunfire from warring rebels and communist government soldiers on the desert plain outside this ancient provincial capital Turbaned men oblivious to the shots face southwest toward the Moslem holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> to begin their evening prayer. Women in voluminous layers of colored cloth move about nearby. The primitive nomad tribes have for centuries encamped near <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>'s satellite village of <LOCATION> Argandab </LOCATION>. Now, Soviet jets scream overhead. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s war goes on around them and sometimes engulfs them. Less than a mile from the nomads' camp, Moslem rebels, blast away at government military posts with recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and light and heavy machine guns. The army's artillery is an even match, but government troops have an advantage in air power from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Newly introduced MiG-27 ground-attack fighters and Backfire bombers have blasted civilian and guerrilla targets since the beginning of November. The question is how long can the government hold <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, a key city, once the Soviets withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. They are committed to do so by February. In <LOCATION> Argandab </LOCATION>, where civilians far outnumber rebels, jets swept one recent day over the main bazaar, levelling a portion of it, killing nine people and wounding 80 others. A squat man with a gray beard said, `` When I wake up in the morning until I go to sleep, I'm not sure about my life, that I will be alive five minutes from now because of the war.'' The old man, wrapped in a blanket, said he lived in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, once the capital of all <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Through the fine dust that hangs over the city, the pale blue dome of the <LOCATION> Kalqi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sharif </LOCATION> mosque can be seen from a distance. The mosque, which embodies the Islamic tenets propelling the rebel mujahedeen in their fight sits opposite the governor's home, a stronghold of the Soviet-backed government. The western entrance to the city is deserted but for the army and militia, tanks and trucks. Civilians are not seen except at the bazaar at <PERSON> Shaheedan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chowk </PERSON>, a pillared monument honoring Afghans killed fighting the British more than a century ago. <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, known as the city of kings, is the birthplace of generations of Afghan royalty. The ornate tomb of <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Durrani </PERSON>, the grandfather of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s exiled King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, is a vernerated site of monarchists who are in the majority around <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, both among the mujahedeen and civilians. The rubble of blasted buildings chokes the streets, forcing motorized rickshaws and horse drawn `` tonga'' carriages to steer an obstacle course through the bazaar. <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalai </PERSON>, a commander of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, said the bulk of the damage near <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION> on the western edge of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> occurred when fighter jets aiming at guerrilla positions in a nearby suburb missed their mark. Evidence that the guerrillas have operated extensively in the city for years is the heavy tank-fire damage to the mud homes and shops. About 50,000 people remain in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> compared to a prewar population of about 200,000, making it second only in size to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s capital. Old men, women and children crowd daily into the bazaar before it closes at 2 p.m. The free access of women and children is used by mujahedeen who employ youngsters to bring supplies to rebel bases from the city. One of the young recruits, <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, said he lost his mother, two younger sisters and a brother when a tank round hit his home in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> two years ago. He was 9 years old at the time. Police once stopped him and a friend carrying turbans, sandals and `` important letters'' to rebels, he said. `` When they captured me they beat me up. Even they broke my head.'' <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> said he spent almost a year in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> prison. `` Everyday for questioning they brought us to a room full of water and made us lie down and they beat us,'' he said. `` I'm not afraid of anything,'' he boasted. But mujahedeen said his forays into the city were finished.

 Young <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> was standing just over a ridge from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, holding a yellow sack, waiting for a film drop from the cameraman in President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s motorcade `` I saw what I thought was the president's limousine, and it seemed to make a wrong turn,'' Rather recalled recently. `` It all went by in a blur. `` I knew something was wrong. You know when you know something, but you do n't know why you know it? I went back over that ridge and saw an incredible scene. Some people were on the ground, some people were trying to cover children. It was a scene of great confusion.'' Rather looked for a telephone but could n't immediately find one. He sprinted to <ORGANIZATION> KRLD </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, a few blocks away. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, working in the newsroom. `` I happened to be standing at the printer when the UP bulletin came across that shots had rung out in <LOCATION> Dealey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` As soon as we got that first report, we ordered up lines and got into the announce booth ... and started interrupting with voiceover bulletins on the ongoing program. And then we got the camera up there I think in about 10 minutes.'' While <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> read wire reports on the air, Rather was at <ORGANIZATION> KRLD </ORGANIZATION> trying to confirm rumors that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was dead. The Parkland Memorial Hospital switchboard told him <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was dead. <ORGANIZATION> KRLD </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> had the head of the hospital saying he was dead Rather finally got a surgeon and a priest who were in the emergency room to confirm that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was dead. Rather told <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> went with it on the air. `` There was n't any doubt in my mind,'' said Rather, who had beaten the opposition on the biggest story of their lives. `` The official announcement was n't made for another 17 minutes. It was a very long 17 minutes.'' After those 17 minutes, <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> was handed a piece of wire copy. `` From <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the flash, apparently official,'' he said solemnly, removing his glasses. `` President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time. Two o'clock Eastern Standard Time. Some 38 minutes ago.'' <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> choked up for a moment, on camera. `` This one really struck home,'' he recalled. `` This was tearing the guts out. `` It was when you finally had to say the word, officially, that he was dead that it really impacted in the way it did.'' <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> walked off the air after six hours and just wanted to call his wife, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON>. The phone lines had been tied up all afternoon. A line came free for a second, and he grabbed it, only to hear a woman ask to speak to `` someone in charge of the news department.'' `` She said, ` I'd like to complain about having that <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> on the air at this time crying his crocodile tears when everyone knows he hated <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.' I said, ` Madam, what is your name?' She gave me her name and address on Park Avenue. I said, ` You are speaking to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, and you, madam, are a goddamn idiot.''' He hung up. On Sunday, the networks were covering the movement of accused assassin <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> to the county jail. Only <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was on live when <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> stepped out of the crowd and shot <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> at point-blank range. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON> was the correspondent on the scene. `` I clearly saw the shooting which was about six feet from where I was,'' he says. `` I had a clear visual field to see somebody fire a revolver into <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s lower abdomen. I did not see <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> come through the crowd. I did not see anybody; I just saw the gunshot. `` What I was seeing was coming out of my mouth. It was the only time I've really experienced doing eyewitness reporting while you're live on the air. <PERSON> Pettit </PERSON> said he has never seen his own coverage of the <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> assassination and does n't want to. `` You know, it's a kind of a historic event in broadcasting, the first televised murder, but for me it was so horrendous a situation to be in and so emotional and so charged with fear, concern and a sense of pending doom that I would not like to relive it. `` I remember hearing our coverage when they had the casket at the rotunda of the Capitol. No narration, just symphonic music. Television really distinguished itself in that time, I think, really devoted itself to the notion that it was holding the country together. Whether it was in truth or not, who am I to say? But at the time, we certainly felt that responsibility.'' `` It was a major moment of course in our history and in our television history,'' <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> said. `` I think we responded as an industry well. We showed our capabilities technologically and substantively as well _ what we covered, how we covered it, the decorum with which we approached the story.'' `` I think these four days were the beginning of the television age, certainly the beginning for television journalism,'' Rather said. `` There was a second-class citizenry to being a television journalist. That day, not only did we take you there, television journalists did some real good reporting. ... That day, we began to feel, hey, we're as good as anybody.''

 Vietnamese authorities have bowed to international appeals and commuted the death sentences of two <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks convicted of subversive activities, an Australian government spokesman said today.

<HEAD>Cubans Pour In And Out Of INS Detention A Year After Prison Riots</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A year after Cubans from the Mariel boatlift rioted at two prisons for a chance at freedom, thousands are out on parole, but more are dribbling back into what could be lifetime custody. Many of the thousands of Cubans held by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will be freed more quickly because of changes made in the review process as a result of the agreement that ended the riots, but others will have to await new laws or the whim of the Cuban government. Critics of the process acknowledge it has increased the number of Cubans freed but say it has other problems. `` We're not saying some of -LRB- the Cuban prisoners -RRB- in there are n't bad,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leshaw </PERSON>, a Legal Aid lawyer who has represented the detainees `` We're saying we're not sure the system is designed to sort out the people who do not belong there.'' The detainees are a minority among the 125,000 Cubans who arrived during the five-month `` Freedom Flotilla'' from the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> in 1980. Many of those who arrived were criminals or mental patients freed from jails and hospitals. A few were arrested on arrival for crimes committed in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Others were convicted of crimes here and turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> for deportation after finishing their sentences. But <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would n't take them back, so they remained in detention. Since the detainees never were officially admitted to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they have existed in legal limbo as `` excludable aliens.'' Courts ruled that the Cubans did not have to released and could be excluded without legal protections. Then rioting erupted at federal prisons in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Nov. 20, 1987, announcement that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had agreed to take back more than 2,500 of the 3,800 Mariel refugees locked up nationwide at the time. The rioters, wielding crudely fashioned weapons, took 145 hostages and burned several buildings. One inmate was killed in the 11-day uprising in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The uprisings ended Dec. 4, 1987, after the government agreed to a moratorium on deportations and a one-time-only <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review of each <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> decision. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the agreement also called for speedy reviews of inmates' cases, which have resulted in the parole of about 60 percent of the detainees. Since the uprisings, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> increased the number of review panels from four to 20. `` The reviews conducted by these panels go beyond anything that's required by law or by court order,'' <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, a deputy associate attorney general, said Thursday `` They're designed to give the detainee and his representative every opportunity to tell the panels anything they feel appropriate in reaching their decisions.'' So far about 2,500 Cubans have been paroled. Parole has been denied to about 1,500 others who will continue to get annual INS reviews but could spend years, even their lives, in <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> custody even through they have finished prison sentences for their crimes. About 115 are at a federal facility in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, awaiting word on whether they will be sent back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Thursday to deport 13 detainees. <PERSON> Leshaw </PERSON> sued to block that, claiming the cases are entitled to additional review. An additional 3,000 Cubans are serving jail sentences and eventually will enter <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention, either to be paroled or held until <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> takes them back. Unless another agreement is reached with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, many will not face deportation, but they will stay in jail indefinitely until an INS panel decides they are fit for parole.

 Gambling that peace will prevail despite a deadlock in Iraq-Iran peace talks, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' European allies are stepping up the postwar dismantling of their military forces in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. In recent days the mine sweeper <PERSON> Crocus </PERSON>, the last of three Belgian warships deployed to the gulf a year ago, sailed for home. The last five Italian warships and one from the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> are preparing to leave by Dec. 31. Officials said those moves, like an earlier cutback in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s regional fleet from 11 to seven ships, came because the Iraq-Iran cease-fire, three months old Sunday, had brought stability to the gulf The European actions could add pressure on President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to step up an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pullout, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has withdrawn one ship and scaled back convoys and other operations. But its 25 warships represent about half the foreign vessels in the region. Diplomats said defense budget cutters are likely to focus on the operation, whose monthly cost the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> estimated at $ 15 million - $ 20 million at its peak <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, however, say the American commitment to peacekeeping has led to the best-ever relations with the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> gulf </LOCATION> states, and the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders remain nervous about a hasty pullout. `` They have made it clear they want us here and they are n't pushing for us to leave too quickly,'' said a senior diplomat <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources say Arab sensitivity to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pullout prompted <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials in September to fudge reports on the departure of the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, listing the cruiser as still on duty nearly a week after it left the area. The Pentagon says decisions on reducing the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ 15 ships in the gulf and a 10 in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> _ depend on the Iran-Iraq cease-fire holding. The Pentagon has given no timetable for cutbacks but says the gulf-based force eventually would revert to five or six ships, the level before last year's buildup to protect shipping endangered by the gulf's `` tanker war.'' The U.N.-sponsored truce has held despite warnings from leaders in both <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that fighting could resume if no peace agreement is achieved. `` The general feeling seems to be that the -LRB- war -RRB- momentum in the gulf is gone, and even if fighting started elsewhere it would n't spread,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said No incidents have been reported since the Aug. 20 cease-fire. Gulf Arab states have appealed to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to help in clearing mines that still pose a major threat to shipping. More than 500 commercial vessels were damaged and more than 300 sailors killed in attacks by both sides during the 8-year-old conflict. The war led the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and six other governments to send or reinforce naval units in the gulf, which provides nearly a fifth of the western world's petroleum. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> foes initially attacked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision as risking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the war. The criticism later faded, and some diplomats expressed amazement that the move scarcely was mentioned in the campaign between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` If anybody told me 18 months ago that we could have the biggest single concentration of warships since World War II in the gulf, with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at war, and it would n't become an election issue, I'd have said they were all wet,'' said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat. Since the cease-fire, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has withdrawn one ship and canceled deployment of another, reduced air patrols and removed a fortified barge from the northern gulf. Instead of escorting commercial vessels in convoys, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships now are posted along the 600-mile gulf to lend assistance if needed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources say there is no sign of cutbacks by the Soviets, who have kept seven to nine ships in and near the gulf since 1986. Just as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s move to expand the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force was prompted in part by that growing Soviet presence, diplomats say, any major change by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could influence the American withdrawal.

Other corporations and philanthropists have offered similar incentives to persuade inner city children to stay in school. Philanthropist <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, for example, promised 61 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> sixth-graders full college scholarships if they stayed in school. A group of businessmen called the `` 100 Black Men of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'' is acting as mentors to a class of 28 ninth-graders and is guaranteeing their college expenses. But <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON> said `` ScholarshipBuilder'' is different from other such `` adopt-a-class'' programs: `` Our program begins earlier in the child's educational career _ first grade _ and provides funds not only for college or other post-secondary education but also a stipend upon high school graduation for students who immediately become fully employed or who enter military service.'' The foundation's future annual contribution could go up or down to meet projected average college costs. But foundation president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> estimated his fund would eventually contribute about $ 8 million, which could appreciate to $ 16 million through investments by the time students are old enough to draw upon it. The Urban League chose inner city schools that ranked high in orderliness, attendance rates, parental involvement and other `` effectiveness'' measures. Students were chosen at random but with an eye toward achieving ethnic and racial balance. The league will continue to administer the scholarship program, including keeping tabs on youngsters' progress. Asked whether <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> would give preference to those students who eventually wanted careers on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said: `` I would say without committing us that we would, if they were qualified.'' The 15 other schools selected are: Capitol View Elementary, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Overton </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Goodale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; 74th <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Earlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Floral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, Lorah Park Elementary, <ORGANIZATION> Olinda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Orchard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Villa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Hendley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Three men belonging to a `` skinhead'' gang were charged in connection with the beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant a week ago, police said Sunday. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON>, 23, <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON>, 20, were charged in what police said was a racially motivated and unprovoked attack on <PERSON> Mulugeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>, 27, who had just been dropped off by friends in front of his home. The friends, who tried to intervene, suffered minor injuries. <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> died a short time after the beating, in which his attackers used a baseball bat. <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> were charged with murder and remained in custody, said Detective <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. Bond for <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON>, charged with second-degree assault, was set at $ 100,000, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON>, who also uses the alias `` <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Death </PERSON>,'' was arrested early Saturday, and <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> were arrested about noon Sunday, he said. The three were to appear in district court Monday afternoon. <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> face additional charges of assault and racial intimidation in a Sept. 10 incident at a grocery store, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. A black security guard and several store employees forcibly ejected a large number of `` skinheads'' about 11 p.m. that evening. In another charge that resulted from the homicide investigation but was unrelated to <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>'s death, police and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrested <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 20, and charged him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution and escape, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. The charge relates to a <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, case involving vandalism to a place of worship, he said. The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith said recently that reports of violent crimes have surfaced in every area where skinhead groups have organized. The civil rights group estimated in October there were about 2,000 young people actively involved in skinhead gangs in 21 states, but noted that many youngsters who adopt the skinhead look reject the racist element. The skinhead subculture emerged in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> as early as the 1960s. Segments of the movement took on <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> overtones in 1985 and since have been supported by and associated with the white supremacist <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and White Aryan Resistance. <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> has a skinhead group of about 20 called East Side White Pride, with ties to the White Aryan Resistance, according to the league. It also has a group called Preservation of the White American Race, with about 10 members, half of whom are women, and a suburban group, Youth of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, the league said. Although police identified the suspects as part of a skinhead gang, officers did not identify any group by name.

 The prelate of <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, which is crumbling for lack of cash, has provoked a heated dispute among churchmen and art experts by putting one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s greatest medieval treasures on sale. The 708-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Mappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION>, Latin for map of the world, has been kept in the cathedral for centuries and is to be auctioned by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in June. News reports put its value at more than $ 4.5 million. The sale announcement Wednesday prompted a leading member of the cathedral's fund-raising committee to resign in protest. Newspapers have published angry editorials against the sale, and <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> town leaders have vowed to fight it. The map shows historical events, Bible stories, topography, animals, plants and 420 cities on a 6-by-4 sheet of vellum. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> is at the center of the map while <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION>, 144 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, is drawn on one edge. The controversy illuminates the dilemma faced by custodians of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s national heritage. The 900-year-old cathedral in <LOCATION> Hereford </LOCATION> is one of many in need of cash, but sales of treasures such as the <ORGANIZATION> Mappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION> threaten to put the nation's historical heritage into the hands of foreign buyers and remove them from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Dean of <LOCATION> Hereford </LOCATION>, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, said in announcing the sale of the map that cathedral authorities need to clear a $ 273,000 overdraft and spend millions more on repairs, more staff, the cathedral's choir and new premises for its library of medieval books. Announcing his resignation from the fund-raising committee, Sir <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>, a former director of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portrait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Museum </PERSON>, said Thursday, `` I was very upset to see the Dean standing outside his cathedral and holding up the <ORGANIZATION> Mappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION>, its finest treasure, for sale to the world. `` If that is the kind of church they are running, I no longer want to be associated with it.'' Replied <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Champion </PERSON>, chairman of the cathedral's appeal committee: `` I am sorry he feels the way that he does ... Put bluntly, it is a choice of what is more important, continuing the work of the cathedral ... or retaining a marvelous medieval treasure.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Hereford </LOCATION>, a town of 48,000, said he wants <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, as secular head of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, to intervene. The map `` may legally be the cathedral's, but morally it belongs to the citizens of <LOCATION> Hereford </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s says that as a national treasure, the <PERSON> Mappa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mundi </PERSON> is equivalent to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 11th century <ORGANIZATION> Bayeux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tapestry </ORGANIZATION> depicting the invasion of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> by <PERSON> William </PERSON> the Conqueror in 1066. <PERSON> Georgina </PERSON> <PERSON> Nayler </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We are outraged that one of the most important documents in the world is about to be put into an auction room.'' Lord <PERSON> Gowrie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s chairman, strongly denies allegations that no effort was made to find a British buyer. `` I am sorry that national institutions have not felt able to buy this great map,'' said <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Gowrie </PERSON>, adding that he spent more than a year seeking a buyer among government-funded bodies such as the British Library. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that chances of the map staying in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> appear slim. Critics accuse Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative administration of starving the arts of adequate government funding. The government favors sponsorship of the arts by private industry. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gem </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cathedrals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying many other cathedrals in financial trouble may have to sell off `` very important treasures.''

 <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> prayed for rain all summer long. Now they pray for just a few days of sunshine. In June, when hot, dry winds blew the dusty dirt off seeds that would n't germinate _ when the worst dry spell since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s left crops withered and stunted _ the Chases never expected their fields would be too muddy at harvest time. `` We've never seen a year like this,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> says, shaking his head. `` We've gone from the worst drought in 50 years to one of the wettest and coldest Octobers ever. One extreme to the other.'' From April 1 through mid-July, the Chases' 1,100-acre cash-crop and dairy farm in southwest <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Barry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> received barely an inch of rain. Since Aug. 1, about 18 inches of rain and an inch of snow have pounded the weak stalks of corn and wilted soybeans _ more than twice the normal amount of precipitation. The Chases are n't alone. Many of the same <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> farmers who struggled through the summer's devastating drought were taunted by rains that came too late to do any good. The recent downpours, which have forced many farmers to delay harvesting their shriveled crops, bring the year to a sad, ironic close. This will be the first time in the Chases' 18 years of farming that they will have no crop to sell. Everything they harvest will be needed to feed their 300 head of beef and dairy cattle. With only about half a silo full of high-moisture corn _ enough to last about three months _ the Chases will have to buy from other farmers. `` A year like this makes you realize more than ever that the weather is the farmer's biggest friend or worst enemy,'' <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> says, sinking into a recliner in the couple's living room. He and his wife, both 51, estimate they lost about half their corn and soybean crop, and all of the string beans they were growing for a canning company. Their wheat crop was harvested before the drought hit in May. But the Chases do n't complain. `` At the height of the drought, you wondered whether you'd have anything at all,'' <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> says with a shrug. The loss of their cash crop represents a 30-percent cut in the Chases' income. To compound their financial plight, their expenses have been 20 percent higher than normal, mostly because of the money they spent on irrigation. But because irrigation only helps when there's some rainfall, `` we got zero out of that,'' <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> says in disgust, recalling the summer nights he and his son, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON>, spent in the fields baby-sitting the irrigation system so that no water was wasted. The Chases are thankful their dairy herd, which represents about 60 percent of the farm's income, is healthy and productive. The income they make on their cash crop usually covers their operating expenses and pays for the 700 acres of land they rent _ about $ 75,000 this year. `` It's really frightening,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> says. `` We do n't know where we'll get it, but it'll work out. ... We do n't dwell on it because it reminds us how horrible that loss really is.'' The Chases also are thankful they have an understanding lender. They're waiting to find out if they qualify for the federal government's $ 3.9 billion drought-relief aid program. But they ca n't help but think back to their early spring projections. On paper, this looked like it was going to be the family's most prosperous year ever. After managing to save their farm from foreclosure three years ago by deeding to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and leasing it back _ parcel by parcel _ the Chases expected this year would be the one to pay off a sizable chunk of the debt they had accumulated. Now, all they'd like to do is finish harvesting by Thanksgiving _ a goal they've met every year. It seems unlikely this time. The Chases, who are in a partnership with son <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> and daughter-in-law <PERSON> Dena </PERSON>, pray for clear skies in order to harvest the remaining acres of corn and soybeans. Every time it rains _ or snows _ several dry days must follow before it's safe to take equipment out in the fields. They've already had equipment stuck in the mud twice `` Now all we can do is pray for a freeze,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> says. `` But if it snows first, that'll just insulate it and it'll stay wet.'' And if the fields are n't harvested in the fall, it means more work in the spring because the fields would have to be cleared before planting. Meanwhile, the corn still standing in the brown, muddy fields is growing moldy, rendering it useless as feed for the cattle. And with each pounding rain, more of the weak crop is ruined. Still, the Chases look ahead with hope. `` I guess the thought of giving up does n't enter my mind,'' <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> says. `` Even though it has been a very trying year and very frustrating, we have a lot to be thankful for and we survive because we know next year will be better.''

<HEAD>Examples Abound Outside Convention on the Homeless</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Conventioneers trying to figure out what to do about the homeless did n't have to walk far from their luxury hotel in the nation's capital to meet the problem face-to-face. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who runs a shelter in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, told the 800 people at the home builders symposium that they were ringed by the homeless. It was not much of an exaggeration. Two blocks from the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>, in an alley, a 64-year-old woman in a smudged, ankle-length wool coat complained about her life on the streets since her husband died in 1976 and she lost her apartment. `` It's a crying shame that people have to live this way,'' said the woman, who is among as many as 15,000 people who are sleeping these cold autumn nights in the doorways of the nation's capital or in crowded temporary shelters because they have no place to live. A couple of blocks further, at a subway entrance, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, 32, held up a cardboard sign: `` Lost apartment to fire ... please help ... all gifts are welcome.'' <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said he can get occasional work with demolition crews for $ 70 a day, but had not earned enough to afford to eat and to rent the cheapest rooms available in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which he said require a $ 150 advance payment for two weeks. `` I try not to look like a street person,'' he said. `` But I'm lucky to get a shower Hopefully by next week I will have amassed enough of a fortune to spend Thanksgiving indoors.'' Estimates of the number of homeless Americans range from 250,000 to several million. Experts agree that they will be a major challenge for President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration. All surveys show that the numbers of the homeless are growing, that they include increasing numbers of families with children and that they are found in all parts of the country. Many are people who hold jobs but do n't earn enough money to pay rent or qualify for mortgages. The symposium, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> and an odd mix of establishment organizations and homeless action groups, sometimes sounded more like a human rights conference or tent revival than a gathering of mostly conservative business people. Participants gave a standing ovation on Friday to <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, whose shelter takes in hundreds of people every night. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who has slept for months on city grates, fasted and been jailed in his 18-year battle for the homeless, accused the government of turning its back on the nation's neediest citizens and challenged the builders to cut their profits to help solve the problem. `` No one has a right to more than they really need to live. Anything beyond that is theft,'' he said. `` I may not be dressed as you are, but I ai n't no different,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said, standing at the podium in an olive drab jacket and a knit shirt open at the collar. Most of his audience, about half of them builders, were in business attire. After his speech, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> told a reporter the well-dressed crowd was made up of `` decent people who struggle to be decent people. That's all anyone can expect.'' But <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>'s suggestion that the builders forsake profits to make low-income housing more affordable did n't sit well with some of them. `` When you continue to talk about giving up some of your profits, that ai n't the way that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> works,'' shouted builder <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said homelessness can not be treated simply as a moral issue. He said it requires a strong federal housing policy and subsidies of low-income housing comparable to the billions of dollars in tax deductions allowed on home mortgage interest. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Colton </PERSON>, builders association executive vice president, said many builders have cut profits to build low-income housing, and the industry has more than its share of bankruptcies. `` Builders are willing to be part of the solution,'' <PERSON> Colton </PERSON> said in an interview, `` but leadership has to come from the federal government. The new administration has the opportunity to focus on the positive side of housing as a national priority.'' The symposium included two days of meetings focusing on how businessmen and others can help shelter the homeless, including sessions on creative financing, job training and construction methods. Some participants also toured homeless shelters in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area. A woman at a floor microphone during one session shouted an appeal: `` If we get together and pray together we can do something about this situation.'' A <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleba </PERSON>, challenged each of the nation's 400,000 church congregations to join local builders in constructing one house apiece for the homeless. <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, in a conference keynote speech, called the homeless `` our brothers and sisters.'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, said some Americans are `` almost too alone to live in a house.'' He said that simply building more houses, particularly for the mentally ill, wo n't solve all the problems. Conventioneers, who paid $ 95 apiece to attend the two-day conference, passed by huge photographs of sorrowful women and children and a naked man standing in a hall before a cluster of wheelchairs. They ate elaborately prepared desserts at the end of a gourmet luncheon and then were told that baskets of vegetables serving as centerpieces would be donated to a homeless shelter.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, faced with unease in the financial markets over the gaping budge deficits, today will name <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> to run <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> and tap <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> as chief financial adviser, transition sources say. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scheduled a morning news conference today to make what his office described only as an announcement about the transtion. But sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the president-elect has enlisted <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> was the right arm of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, both when <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was White House chief of staff and later as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary. He played a behind-the-scenes role in negotiating the 1983 rescue plan for Social Security. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> was a whiz kid for <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> as secretary of health, education and welfare in the early 1970s. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> is a well-known conservative economist and expert on the Social Security system. He was a father of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` flexible freeze'' idea to drive down the deficit in four years. The stock market has sagged and the value of the dollar fallen since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> captured the White House Nov. 8 from fears that his no-tax-hike pledge will impede efforts to bring down the deficit, now growing by $ 155 billion a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he takes the deficit seriously and will work with Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to forge a solution. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent a quiet weekend out of the limelight, attending church Sunday, jogging and conferring at home with Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, his chosen chief of staff. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was also meeting today with two former presidents, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who have made some bipartisan recommendations for the incoming president. Also on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule is a meeting with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Packard </PERSON>, the computer magnate who headed a commission that recommended an overhaul of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement procedures. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> revealed last Tuesday he is keeping his friend <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as treasury secretary. He told reporters Friday he was concentrating on naming the rest of his economic team before turning his attention to defense and national security posts. In <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> was deputy to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as treasury secretary. Both left the government when <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> resigned in August to run <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> argued in a recent book titled `` Too Many Promises'' that the program should be overhauled to separate its welfare and pension functions. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> proposed a two-tier system, with a flat monthly payment aimed at helping people stay out of poverty and the second or upper tier tied strictly to how much people paid into the system. Currently there is a sharp tilt to Social Security benefits, with lower-income workers getting a far heftier return on their payroll taxes than middle - and upper-income workers <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, his longtime associate from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, as his choice for secretary of state the morning after the election. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who served eight months as a caretaker senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in 1982, was sworn in two months ago as <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s successor at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. He is a former chairman of the investment banking house of <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co..

 The federal employee drug-testing program instituted by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will quadruple in size next year unless stopped in its tracks by legal challenges. An estimated 50,000 employees were tested this year, mainly law enforcement officers, transportation inspectors and civilians working for the military. But the program is expected to test some 200,000 members of the 3.1 million federal work force in 1989, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. About 150,000 to 170,000 of those will be tested at random and come from a pool of some 500,000 workers in positions deemed sensitive by their agency chiefs. The remainder will be tested after accidents or when supervisors believe there is reasonable suspicion of drug use. Those figures do not include untold numbers of federal job applicants who will be tested if applying for sensitive positions, nor do they reflect the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s far-reaching requirement to test nearly four million private sector transportation workers _ from truckers to airline pilots. That program would begin late next year for businesses employing more than 50 workers. Those with fewer than 50 would have two years to get ready for testing. Most suits against testing, many filed by unions, are in federal district or appeals courts. Only two have been argued before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, but neither involves the random testing that has been challenged as an intrusive, unconstitutional search. `` By the first of the year most all of the tier one -LRB- the 42 largest -RRB- agencies, the largest chunk of the work force, will have their programs up and running,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Workplace Initiatives. The office coordinates and approves federal testing plans. The testing program has its origin in a Sept. 15, 1986, presidential order directing that federal workplaces be drug-free. Besides testing, other components include training supervisors to recognize symptoms of drug abuse among employees, and counseling programs at federal agencies. The counseling is mandatory for those who test positive. Workers can also make voluntary use of the programs, as can members of their families. Once entering the counseling program after a positive test, most workers will suffer no disciplinary action if follow-up tests show they refrained from drug use. `` The purpose is to get a person back on the job,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said, but he cautioned that workers can be disciplined at the discretion of their agencies for continued drug use. In the most sensitive law enforcement and national security jobs, workers can be fired the first time drug abuse is discovered, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. The program has held up well so far in court decisions. One suit challenged <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1986 executive order as unconstitutional, but a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> judge dismissed the action. A federal judge in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> held the random portion of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s civilian testing program unconstitutional. But the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> invalidated the decision pending appeal, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> continued testing. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s internal testing program was upheld by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including after-accident testing challenged by air traffic controllers. In a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case, however, a federal judge stopped the Bureau of Prisons from testing anyone except applicants for employment. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sued their own agency to stop random testing, and won an injunction in district court. Arguments are set for Dec. 15 before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. There has been no decision in a suit challenging testing in the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The cases argued before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 2 involve the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But since neither involved random testing, they might not decide the broad constitutionality of the entire testing program. The FRA issued orders in 1985 that required railroads to take blood and urine specimens _ for alcohol and drugs _ after accidents, incidents and rules violations. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last February that the tests are unreasonable searches banned by the Constitution's Fourth Amendment But the court stayed its decision in order to allow an appeal to go forward, and testing continued. The Customs Service requires tests for anyone applying for a promotion or transfer to a job involving drug enforcement. That program was upheld by the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Testing is `` obviously a violation of individual privacy and the Constitution, because of its provisions against unreasonable search and seizure,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Childers </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> _ a union that has filed several lawsuits against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s program. She added that random testing `` does not indicate on-the-job impairment,'' and requires no probable cause or even reasonable suspicion of drug use. Ms. <PERSON> Childers </PERSON> said the union does not oppose after-accident testing. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil division, disagreed, saying, `` We're not talking about the exercise of government police power or generalized searches of people as a whole.'' He added there's a `` diminished expectation of privacy'' in many sensitive federal jobs, which begin with an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check. `` Many of those jobs require a physical exam with urinalysis required,'' he said. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> guidelines have strict test controls. Procedures for custody of the samples are carefully controlled to avoid mixups, there are strict criteria for testing laboratories, test evidence is not to be used in criminal prosecutions and there's no observation of the worker giving the sample. A collection person of the same gender will be in the bathroom, however. Testing is for five drugs: cocaine, marijuana, PCP, opiates and amphetamines.

 The <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>'s big day is this week, but thanks to a lot of scientific derring-do the old bird has turned into a year-round sort who is welcome almost anytime. Another result is that pampered, commercially grown male turkeys have become so large they are n't effective lovers. So the females have to be artificially inseminated. When founding father <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> proposed the <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> as the symbol of the newly born <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ he thought the eagle was rather a scoundrel _ it was the trim, hard-muscled wild turkey <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> had in mind. The wily wild turkey still thrives in woodlands and is much sought by hunters. And it is still trim and muscular. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> `` might scarcely believe his eyes if he could see today's turkey, with its blossomed breast and extra servings of favored white meat.'' <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, writing in the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, noted that per capita consumption of turkey rose from a paltry 2.8 pounds in 1940 to 15.2 pounds in 1987. This year consumption is expected to average 16.5 pounds, and a slight rise is forecast for 1989, perhaps to 16.6 pounds. Much of this increase has come since 1980 and can be attributed largely to more processed turkey products such as turkey ham, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> bologna, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> franks and other items, not to mention packaged parts. But before turkey ham and all the others, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had already started to help move turkey production out of the doldrums, she said. In those days after World War II, large domestic turkeys were enjoyed _ for a day or so _ but a good portion of the leftovers lingered on and on and on. Thus, most families steered clear of turkeys except for those special occasions such as Thanksgiving. In 1947, after a decade of development, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> commercially introduced the <ORGANIZATION> Beltsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> turkey, named after the department's research center in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where the bird was developed. After only seven years, in 1954, the <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION> turkey represented 28 percent of the 67 million birds produced that year. The new birds averaged around nine pounds when shipped to market, compared with 15 pounds or so for the other commercial breeds. Today, the genes of the <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION> Small White are spread among many of the modern breeds. One of the prized characteristics was its reproductive capabilities, says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, a poultry physiologist and director of the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poultry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said the Small White female could crank out more than 100 eggs in six months, handily topping the output of other commercial breeds. Another benchmark development came in 1980 when <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> and other agency researchers hit upon the <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION> Poultry Semen Extender, a mixture that allowed turkey semen to be stored for six to eight hours without losing viability. All commercial turkeys are produced from artificial insemination. `` If we left it up to nature, the reproductive rate of domestic turkeys would be about half of what it is now,'' <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said. `` If you artificially inseminate a flock, you can expect a 90 to 95 percent fertility rate in the eggs produced. But in a naturally mated flock you might get 45 to 50 percent.'' <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said the male turkey used for breeding may average 40 to 50 pounds, compared with 25 pounds or less for the female. `` And there's a big difference in attitude in these big males,'' he said. `` They're more interested in eating than mating.'' Before the <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION> Poultry Semen Extender was perfected, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> semen had to be used within 30 minutes after it was collected. That meant the toms had to be on the same farm with the females. The extender sent most of the toms to market and allowed those remaining to be bunched together on turkey stud farms, <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said the extender allows a single male to inseminate as many as 40 females a week, compared with only about 10 before. The nation's turkey output jumped sharply in 1987 to a record of more than 240 million birds and another 5 percent increase is expected this year, according to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Half a dozen states produce more than two-thirds of the turkeys, led in 1987 by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and followed by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>.

 After their first post-election meeting, the Democrats are determined to avoid wholesale revisions of their rules but are ready to consider major changes in the presidential primary and caucus calendar. The 1992 presidential campaign may see a drastically altered Super Tuesday and find <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> deprived of their first-in-the-nation status. `` Everybody thinks the thing ought to be shortened,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, echoing a sentiment expressed by several of his colleagues. `` I'm going to tell you, everybody's damn tired of rules changes,'' said <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>. `` And I think the average Democrat thinks we're absolutely insane if we get into another big battle about rules. `` They want us to worry about how we're going to win elections.'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> chairman, speaking for the Western states, said, `` We are concerned in our region about the timing and sequence of the presidential primaries and caucuses.'' One idea that got a lot of favorable attention at the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairs was to hold a lottery to determine which states would lead off the process. While not endorsing the proposal, national party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called it an idea worth considering. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said that if the parties move toward regional primaries `` there ought to be one or two smaller states that begin the process.'' One regional primary that may not be repeated in the form it had in 1988 is Super Tuesday, the day that most Southern states agreed to hold their primaries. The motivation behind Super Tuesday was to give the process a more conservative voice. But the big winner on that day was <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the eventual nominee was <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> called Super Tuesday `` too large and too widespread'' to give the region an effective voice. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> party chair, both said they opposed continuation of Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he favored moving the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> primary to June when the state votes to nominate candidates for other offices. That move, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, would save the $ 1.2 million it costs to hold a separate presidential primary. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> also endorsed the idea of asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact lottery legislation or some other method of shortening the primary season and removing <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> from its status as the first state to begin selecting delegates. After their fifth defeat in the last six presidential elections, many Democratic officials are saying that <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> plays too much of a role in defining the nominating campaign debate. Neither the Republican nor Democratic caucus winner in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> won his party's nomination, but the state was the scene of most of the early campaigning. For the Democrats, in particular, that meant pressure to take stands on defense and other issues that party officials now feel were out of touch with the feelings of most voters. Another issue that dominated discussion at the state chairs meeting was the question of whether <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> would agree to serve another four years as chairman. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> disclosed that among those urging him to seek another four-year term were <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the party's presidential and vice presidential nominees But <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said he had not made up his mind and would not until after Thanksgiving.

 When President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to pilot the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into the 1990s, it was a warning and an opportunity for the Democrats. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is the nation's leading practitioner of the `` politics ai n't beanbag'' school of campaigning, the man who made rapist <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> a household name and turned the Pledge of Allegiance into an attack on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. There was nothing pretty or ennobling about the strategy <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> pursued as manager of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential campaign. But it worked and his candidate carried 40 states and will become the 41st president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his handlers consistently underestimated <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and his tactics. In the euphoric spring and summer days when the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had double-digit leads in every poll, Democrats generally shrugged off the attacks on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough program and the questions raised about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' veto of legislation to require public school teachers to lead the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> partisans called the attacks typical of <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s fondness for negative campaigning The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager was panicking, they said. They were wrong. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had a far better understanding of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vulnerabilities than did the Democrats. Now the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager is undertaking a different role at a critical political juncture. From the initial reaction of Democratic state party leaders, they do n't intend to make the mistake of underestimating the young political tactician from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` We're ready to take on <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and those who create a pit bull style of politics,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't intend to get out-muscled,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` I do n't intend to let them play that kind of game with us and win it.'' The Democrats were sending a clear message: We can get just as tough and negative as <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. But they went beyond that. They also were jumping at an opportunity to make <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> himself a political issue. One of the ironies of the 1988 campaign was that while voters' opinion of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was formed to a great extent by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacks, they objected to the negative tone of the campaign The question now is whether there is enough of a hangover from the nasty tone of the presidential campaign to tar <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was asked if he looked forward to working with <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the way he had often cooperated with current <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> gave a low-key response but made his point. `` I do n't know <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>,'' he said. `` But from what I've seen he probably brings a slightly different approach to the public domain and politics than I would have.'' Warming to the subject, he continued, `` I want to be fair to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, if that's not being too naive. I do n't want <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> setting the tone for politics in the 1980s and 1990s _ at least from what I've seen in the most recent campaign.'' The stakes will be high for both parties when <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> assumes his new role just before Inauguration Day in January. In the presidential campaign, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was operating in an area where the Republicans have a built-in advantage. Going into 1988, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates had won four of the last five presidential elections. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made it five of the last six. But when <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> takes over at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he'll be trying to overcome a big Democratic advantage in congressional and local elections. The 1990 elections will determine who draws the new district lines for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> as well as for states legislatures. Right now, the Democrats control 28 state legislatures, while the Republicans are a majority in only eight. In 13 states, each party controls one of the two legislative bodies. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> has a nonpartisan unicameral legislature. In addition, 28 of the nation's 50 governors are Democrats. The importance of redistricting was demonstrated in the last two elections when only a handful of incumbents seeking re-election were defeated. The political success of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> incumbents suggests that the only possibility of a major shift in the party lineup comes once every 10 years, in the election following the redrawing of district lines to comply with a new census.

 The average American earned $ 18,200 last year compared with the equivalent of $ 8,362 for the average citizen of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> says. The figures are contained in the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s recently released `` Handbook of Economic Statistics _ 1988,'' which compared actual purchasing power. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> figured the total production of 243.8 million Americans in 1987 was worth $ 4.436 trillion, while 284 million Soviets produced $ 2.375 trillion. Americans also live longer to enjoy their prosperity: 75 years to 69 for the average Soviet, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. But residents of several other countries have longer average lifespans than those of Americans: 78 years in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 77 in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and 76 in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The agency said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had the highest average income in the leading Western industrial countries known as the Group of Seven. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was second with $ 17,080, followed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with $ 13,360, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 13,180, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> $ 12,780, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> $ 12,260 and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> $ 12,080. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> did not give figures for <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where according to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, average income was higher than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: $ 21,250 compared with $ 18,430. Communist-ruled countries were well behind, with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> doing best at $ 11,873, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. The average in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was only $ 273 compared with $ 4,320 on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Among other countries of east <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> did best with $ 8,250, followed by <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> with $ 6,810, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was last at $ 2,810. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic production grew last year at a rate of 2.9 percent, compared to a Soviet increase of just 0.5 percent. But it said the Soviets devoted a larger proportion of their income to investment than Americans, and a smaller proportion to consumption. Economists consider this relationship important, since investment is seen as the key to the wealth of the future. The Soviets, though they still import much of their grain from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been improving their own farm production faster: 17 percent more in 1987 than in 1980, compared with a 4 percent increase in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Prices paid by Soviet consumers also have been rising more slowly: 14 percent since 1980, compared with 38 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said its information on Communist-ruled countries came from official data, its own estimates or estimates made by other organizations.

 Less than a year after the death of his cancer-stricken wife, Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> shocked television viewers when he admitted, `` I administered something to terminate her life.'' Now the 47-year-old <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> pathologist is on trial here on charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the Jan. 15, 1986, death of <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, his wife of 23 years. Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, 43, suffered from lung cancer, which doctors say had spread to other organs. The state contends the interview, broadcast Nov. 12, 1986, amounted to a confession. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> admitted his wife did n't die of cancer. He said she wanted to die before the situation became horrible and that he merely helped her on her way. `` There was no question <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> wanted to end her life,'' said Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>, who expects to finishing presenting his case before Thanksgiving. The trial, now in its fourth week, was moved from <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> because of extensive pretrial publicity. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> gave his wife 20 pills of <LOCATION> Secanol </LOCATION> _ a strong sedative _ and when that did n't work, he gave her morphine injections, then morphine suppositories, prosecutors said. During the trial, however, Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>'s stepfather, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Delman </PERSON>, has described in detail how he smothered her after Rosier's botched attempts `` I decided to gently cover her nose and mouth,'' <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> testified, demonstrating on himself for the jury. `` I did n't give it a second thought ... I did n't get any pulse ... I did n't hear any more sound.'' <PERSON> Delman </PERSON>, 68, a retired <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dentist, said he was afraid she might become a `` vegetable'' after <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> left her unconscious and lingering near death for 12 hours. `` He obviously did n't do such a good job,'' <PERSON> Delman </PERSON> said, adding that he decided, `` Enough is enough.'' He testified as a key state witness under a grant of immunity. No charges were filed against him because he and his two sons, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Delman </PERSON>, successfully negotiated an immunity agreement before prosecutors knew the extent of their involvment. They are the state's star witnesses. The defense said the state was taken. `` This is not a murder case. It is wrongful prosecution,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>, who has n't decided yet whether to put Rosier on the stand. `` Prosecution is a face-saving device.'' However, the state maintains it had no choice. Without the Delmans' testimony, there was very little on which to build a case. No autopsy was performed, and Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> was cremated 52 hours after her death. Even if they had known beforehand, prosecutors still would have extended immunity to the Delmans, testified <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, lead investigator. `` It changed nothing,'' he said. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> `` orchestrated his wife's death. Through a prior arrangement, permitted in terminally ill cases, <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s office and told coroners officials his wife was dying. She was placed on an expected death list. No autopsy would be necessary. A death certificate signed by one of her treating physicians attributed death to lung cancer, according to testimony. Attorneys for both sides agree the couple made a double suicide pact after Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>'s cancer was diagnosed in spring 1985. But <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> did n't go through with it for the sake of his children, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, now 19, and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 21, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Activists Aim Voting Rights Act at State Judge Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Civil rights activists say a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to stay on the sidelines in a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> case leaves the field clear for their attempts to give black voters more say in the selection of state judges. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said the court's refusal last week to hear <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s appeal of a ruling that the Voting Rights Act applies to state judicial elections `` gives the green light'' to lawsuits challenging the election process for judges in six states The suits have been filed in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The lawsuits represent a new wave in litigation under the 1965 law, which has been used by legal activists during the past decade to force hundreds of local governments and school boards across the South to abandon at-large elections of their members. The demise of at-large elections has coincided with a huge increase in the number of black elected officials at the local level. Between 1977 and 1987, the number of blacks on county commissions, school boards and city councils nationwide increased from 3,515 to 5,490. `` They're trying to accomplish exactly the same thing with the judiciary that they've accomplished with legislative offices,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> attorney hired to represent the state in a lawsuit challenging the election method used for circuit court and district court judges. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said activists initially focused on removing barriers to the election of blacks to legislative offices because that's where policy is set and laws are enacted. Now, he said, the challenges directed at state judicial systems may be even more important in ending racial discrimination. `` In terms of the impact this litigation has, it's very high,'' he said. `` Judges have the power to put people in jail for long periods of time; they have the power to put people to death. The business of state courts ... is very critical to the lives of minorities.'' The lawsuits contend that at-large elections of judges violate the Voting Rights Act by diluting black voting strength and denying blacks an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. In an at-large judicial election, two or more judges are elected by all the voters of a jurisdiction created by the state. The lawsuits contend that black voters have little chance to elect judges of their choice when they live in majority-white jurisdictions, even though they may constitute a majority in a specific section of the jurisdiction. That argument already has prevailed in three states. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a federal lawsuit challenging the method of electing <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges was withdrawn after the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last year adopted a new judicial districting plan acceptable to civil rights advocates. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, where the first lawsuit using the Voting Rights Act to challenge state court elections was filed in 1984, a federal judge divided eight districts where state court judges were elected at-large into 22 single-member districts, including 14 that are majority black. The first elections under the new plan will be held in February. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, a federal judge ruled in favor of civil rights activists in a similar lawsuit and instructed the Legislature to develop a new election plan for state trial court judges that does not violate the Voting Rights Act. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> case that reached the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week involved a challenge to the at-large election of two state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices from a district made up of four parishes. The lawsuit, still awaiting trial, asks for the creation of two single-member districts, with one being majority black. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> officials argued that the Voting Rights Act should not apply to judges because it only covers `` representatives'' of the people, namely members of the legislative and executive branches of the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision not to hear <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s appeal leaves the issue of whether the Voting Rights Act applies to judicial election without a final resolution for the time being. But some lawyers who are using the voting law to challenge state judge elections say the court's silence suggests that it believes the law does apply, particularly since several state judicial systems already are being revamped because of rulings based on the voting law. `` I think the court would have taken the first one it had if it disagreed with -LRB- the lower court -RRB- because they would n't want a state to go through the change and two years later say, ` now it's time to look at this,''' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney who is representing the black voters in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> lawsuit. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, however, said he sees no hidden meaning in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. He said the court's action last week wo n't stop him from contending that the Voting Rights Act does not apply to judicial elections in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>

 Food and tobacco giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday extended its deadline for buyout offers after a potential new bidder said it was considering making a record offer of up to $ 26.6 billion. The tentative proposal for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> from a group led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> would be nearly double the biggest acquisition on record, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 13.4 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. The <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> proposal, its first expression of interest in the consumer goods giant, easily topped two sweetened offers made by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> management and the buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, is the nation's 19th biggest industrial company, and the maker of hundreds of consumer items that range from <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuervo </PERSON> tequila and <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> cigarettes to Life Savers candy and Milk Bone dog snacks The offers disclosed Sunday top all previous bids, and a special <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> committee that is running the auction indicated that its decision to extend the bidding period could produce even higher offers. `` Due to the varying potential values and nature of the consideration offered in the two bids and the proposal, and the varying terms, conditions and contingencies associated with each, the special committee determined not to make any recommendation at this time'' regarding any of the proposals, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON>, the committee's chairman. The five-member committee of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors also said it would accept bids through Nov. 29. The panel had initially cut off bidding at 5 p.m. last Friday. The preliminary offer by the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston-Pritzker </ORGANIZATION> group would involve the acquisition in 1989 of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s tobacco business, which accounts for about 40 percent of its annual sales, followed by the installment sale of its food businesses. First <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> indicated the total consideration could range from $ 98 to $ 110 cash a share, plus securities and stock warrants valued at from $ 7 to $ 8 a share. The warrants would entitle <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to acquire up to 20 percent of the tobacco business. At $ 118 a share, the maximum possible offer from the group would be $ 26.6 billion. The committee said the management-led group, which is allied with the investment firms <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had raised its offer to $ 100 a share in cash for 175 million of the company's 225.3 million outstanding common shares. The group said it would acquire the remaining shares for $ 56 cash, plus securities and common stock in the surviving company that it said would bring the total consideration to $ 100 a share. The common stock would equal about 15 percent of the surviving company's outstanding shares, according to the special committee The $ 100 a share offer values <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> at $ 22.5 billion. The management group's previous offer had been for $ 92 a share, or $ 20.7 billion. The new offer by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> _ which previously had offered $ 90 a share, or about $ 20.3 billion _ included $ 94 cash a share for about 178 million <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> shares, with the remaining shares to be exchanged for preferred stock and securities the firm valued at $ 94 a share, giving its offer an indicated value of about $ 21.2 billion. Management started the bidding a month ago when it announced it was considering a buyout offer, and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> quickly entered the fray with a competing bid. Both parties submitted firm offers to the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> committee by Friday's deadline, but they said late Sunday they were undecided whether to make new offers.

<HEAD>Extra Control Room Shifts Added at Problem-Plagued Reactor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Efforts to fix problems that stopped production at the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility able to produce nuclear weapons material intensified today with the addition of extra control room shifts at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant. Federal officials also are expanding their on-site control as part of a sweeping safety drive that makes it unlikely the plant will meet a Dec. 31 goal for resuming production. Creating an extra, fifth shift for each of the plant's three reactors means that one of the 14-member control-room teams will be undergoing training at any given time. The crews will double the time they spend each year on a computer simulator, up to 150 hours, and classroom work will be expanded as well, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahfield </PERSON>, a Du Pont reactor program manager. Putting federal officials permanently inside each reactor facility, for the first time, will allow the government to keep a closer eye on their operation, which has been run since 1950 under contract by the E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The changes are designed to improve safety at the sprawling 300-square mile site in a pine forest along the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where more than 16,000 employees work under tight security. The scene is surprisingly tranquil outside K reactor, the first of the three scheduled to return to operation. Inside the massive concrete and reinforced steel structure, workers use remote-control cranes and arms to prepare the reactor for restart. `` They had set a target date of Dec. 31, but I would think it would be after the 31st,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cwalina </PERSON>, a Du Pont reactor supervisor. No new date has been announced. Changes also are taking place in the administration complex, `` a beehive of activity,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a 14-year veteran of the plant and deputy manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team preparing to restart K reactor. The reorganization, which began several years ago, widened this fall. The top <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> safety official, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, warned in September that some senior federal officials at the plant had `` an attitude toward production reactor safety, which on the face seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program prior to the Challenger accident.'' Such criticism raises hackles at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> killed 10 people. We never injured anybody with a nuclear accident,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cwalina </PERSON>, a reactor supervisor, referring to the seven people killed in the Challenger shuttle disaster and three killed in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier Apollo program `` Our people have never hesitated, if they were concerned about safety, to order a reactor shut down,'' said <PERSON> Cwalina </PERSON>. `` One thing that we are learning is that you have to instill confidence among your overseers that you are operating a reactor safely.'' That means convincing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the aging reactors can run safely at 100 percent power, rather than the 50 percent ceiling they have been under since a critical report last year by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. Safety measures being instituted at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> include: _ Raising operating standards to the same level as those attained by commercial nuclear utility plants in the wake of the accident at <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in March 1979 That `` will take years,'' according to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. A key to this is developing detailed mathematical models of how the reactor core behaves, especially during problems. _ Establishing `` a paper trail, from the cradle to the grave,'' for important steps, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` Before, I used an informal note. Now I use a quality control form. And more people receive copies.'' _ Assuring that each shift is supervised by an operator who holds a bachelor's degree in science or engineering Nine of the 12 shift teams meet that standard now. _ `` An increase in oversight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an increase in line control, an increase in overview and management. And <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> is increasing its overview,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. In one key change, engineers from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regional office at the plant will be stationed permanently at each reactor and managers and inspectors who previously visited the reactors only on a spot basis `` will be going out considerably more'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` The biggest increase will be technical review engineers. These are the guys that will be living out there. Plus there will be technical inspections,'' said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the nation still has enough nuclear materials for weapons, for the time being. Plutonium supplies are adequate, according to Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, but tritium, which decays at the rate of 5.5 percent per year, could be running short by next summer, say administration and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 Ending a three-day visit to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> joined with Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in urging the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to help establish a coalition government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` A U.N.-supported international conference may be needed for this purpose,'' the two said in a statement released before the Soviet president returned home Sunday night. The communique did not reflect a change in the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s position, but it coincides with increasing Soviet efforts for a political settlement of the war After nine years of Soviet military intervention, the war still rages. Under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in April, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is to complete the withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. About half the estimated 100,000 Soviet soldiers have left, although the withdrawal of troops was halted earlier this month because of recent rebel successes. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also signed an agreement for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to build two nuclear reactors for an Indian power plant. During the visit, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> concluded agreements for economic, scientific and cultural programs worth $ 5.3 billion, said an Indian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The statement on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said `` the process of national reconciliation should be encouraged.'' `` National reconciliation'' is the term President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has used in his efforts to persuade anti-communist guerrillas to stop fighting and participate in his government. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> appealed to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> `` to implement without delay'' a Nov. 3 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that calls for an end to foreign interference and for the creation of a broad-based government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

But it has provided new warplanes, surface-to-surface missiles and economic aid to bolster the government. On Saturday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> _ the chief backers of the Afghan guerrillas _ of creating obstacles in settling the Afghan problem. The nuclear power agreement signed by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> calls for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to build two 1,000-megawatt reactors within 10 years in southern <LOCATION> Tamil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nadu </LOCATION> state. It was not disclosed what safeguards the Soviets would impose for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s largest nuclear power project. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has been hampered in getting Western assistance for its nuclear projects because it has refused to open its plants for international inspection. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> advocates nuclear disarmament but has refused to sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, saying the pact discriminates against developing nations. The Soviets and Indians also agreed to cooperate in the exploration of space in the coming decade.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the presidential election with a boost from dozens of wealthy supporters who pitched in by giving $ 100,000 or more to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, GOP records show. In addition to the Republican `` Team 100'' roster of people who gave at least $ 100,000, a list released by party officials shows millions more collected from supporters who gave amounts ranging upward from $ 5,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> made public a list of contributors who gave about $ 20 million to its so-called soft money account _ money that legally can not be donated directly to a presidential campaign but which the party can spend on a variety of election-related activities that end up benefiting the presidential candidate. The Republicans had a banner year with their soft money program, the records show, allowing them to more than double the $ 46 million in public funds that the presidential nominees are allowed to spend themselves. That money comes from the $ 1 voluntary checkoff on individual income tax returns. The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> list of heavy hitters includes such <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> stalwarts and longtime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> loyalists as <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON>, as well as corporate donors such as <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate mogul <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> gave $ 100,000. Also listed is <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamps </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a multimillionaire oil man and horse breeder who hosted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his close friend, on the president-elect's post-election beach vacation last week in <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> is listed as having given $ 75,000 Also listed were <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who hosted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation on a yacht cruise with several friends. But the list the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> gave to reporters may reveal only a portion of the amount a given contributor actually has donated. <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> officials said this list, which includes 78 donors who gave $ 100,000, did not include all the contributors, and did not give a full accounting for the donations because some people also gave money also to separate `` Victory'88'' accounts that the party set up in each state. Money given to these accounts, often at high-dollar fund-raisers attended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> while he was on the campaign trail, was not brought into the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> accounts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Party officials have refused to disclose those funds and are not required by law to do so. The Democrats also had an active soft money program and have disclosed receipts. The soft money system is criticized by many as a blatant loophole that gets around election-law limits on political spending. It enables the parties to accept money that otherwise would be barred from presidential campaigns, including corporate money and individual donations exceeding the $ 1,000 cap set by election law. The money was used for generic party advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts and such things as buttons and bumper stickers. Following is a list of those who gave the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> $ 100,000, and where noted, more than that amount: _ A.G Spanos Construction, <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>;

<TEXT>
 The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen Monday, while share prices rose moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 122.52 yen, up 0.12 yen from Friday's close of 122.40 yen. Opening at 122.40 yen, the currency moved in a narrow range of 122.37 yen and 122.60 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 103.39-point winner Friday, added another 104.06 points or 0.36 percent to finish at 29,284.26, a new record high. On Friday, the index closed at 29,180.20. The dollar traded around its opening level in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> as the market turned increasingly cautious about selling the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency following concerted intervention Friday by the world's major central banks, said a dealer at the Bank of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Because of the extent of intervention Friday during both <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> dealings, there is no apparent force in the market now to push the dollar down further, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But he said upward momentum was also absent. `` Although the dollar-yen rate is stabilized for the moment, it does n't mean participants are willing to buy the dollar,'' he added. On the stock exchange, `` market players were interested in wide variety of issues,'' said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage `` It's a sign that more people are looking for places to invest their money,'' he said, asking that he not be identified.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkes </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> was n't a shiftless actor who killed <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> out of despondency over the South's loss in the Civil War, but a Confederate intelligence agent, a new book contends. Confederate leaders sanctioned the assassination as a last-ditch effort toforce the North into peace negotiations, three former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officers wrote in `` Come Retribution,'' recently published by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> also used an underground intelligence network for his escape after shooting <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> during a performance at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Theatre in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, on April 14, 1865, five days after Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s surrender at <LOCATION> Appomattox </LOCATION>, the authors contend. `` The book challenges the long-held belief that, in the closing months of the Civil War, the Confederacy stubbornly held out against surrender even though it had no hope of winning its independence,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>, one of the authors, wrote in a recent article. `` It shows instead that the Confederates had a well-developed plan for the campaign of 1865 which they believed would result in a Southern victory or at least a stalemate.'' The Confederacy had wanted to kidnap <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, but when that plan failed, it plotted to blow up the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> said. The bombing plan was aborted when a Confederate demolition expert was arrested, <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> said. Southern leaders finally decided to kill <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, demoralize the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and begin a last ditch offensive, <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s surrender of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> had virtually ended the war by that time, but <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> thought he could save the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> by killing <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>'s co-authors are <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who served in <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> intelligence during World War II, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaddy </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> said the three used their intelligence experience to re-examine the assassination and uncover what they alleged was a well-established Conferederate intelligence network. They examined thousand of documents in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> over a 10-year period. `` Our evidence is largely circumstantial,'' <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> said. `` Basically, we are trying to tell our story by putting together many small pieces of information, each well documented.'' The authors contend <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> was not helped during his escape by strangers or a rag-tag band of sympathizers hastily assembled before the assassination. Instead, <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> appears to have followed the main Confederate underground network leading from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the Confederate capital in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the book contends. Of the 17 who helped <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>'s escape, the authors were able to link 12 with the Confederacy, eight of whom had participated in Confederate intelligence activities. The authors also elaborate on the activities of a Southern intelligence operation that spied in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The book's title comes from a code system the Confederate intelligence used in which a certain word or phrase was used to decipher messages. `` Come Retribution'' was the last code key used by Confederate intelligence, <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> said. A chart used to decipher the code was found among <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>'s effects after he was shot by Union soldiers 11 days after the assassination of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Product Safety Chairman Quitting For Think Tank Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>, a Democrat who has promoted voluntary safety programs as the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, is resigning to take a post with a conservative think tank The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> would become vice president and treasurer of the organization effective Jan. 3. One of the highest ranking Democrats in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> has run his agency with a philosophy close to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s emphasis on voluntary safety programs and cooperation with industry. Consumer advocates attacked his approach and urged promoting product safety more aggressively, but <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> responded that voluntary programs can be established more quickly than government regulations. `` You can do a voluntary standards approach at the same time you have an enforcement program,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> said that under his leadership, the independent agency's civil penalties against companies violating safety standards reached an all-time high <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> cited as a major accomplishment of his tenure at the agency an agreement last year to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in halting imports of unsafe products before they reach domestic store shelves. A former aide to Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before he was appointed to the safety agency. He was the agency's chairman from December 1985 to December 1986, but had to relinquish the post when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> failed to confirm his appointment within a year. The delay coincided with an investigation of charges that <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> had used the commission's staff for personal projects. He was exonerated of any criminal wrongdoing and was confirmed as commission chairman in July 1986. The commission consists of five members, and a quorum of three is needed to conduct business. Currently, only three commissioners are serving because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not provided funds for the two remaining positions. <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON>'s departure would leave only <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> as commissioners, too few for the agency to conduct business. <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> will be in charge of fund raising and financial management at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which also has attracted several former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials including former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Trying To Cross Into United States, Canadian Learns He's A Criminal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON> says he did n't know he had a criminal record until he was barred entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. After a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customs officer did a computer check, <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON>, 41, was told there was a record of a narcotics offence _ cultivation of marijuana _ that meant he was n't allowed into the country. Four years ago, police seized two marijuana plants from <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON>'s garden at his home in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Arnprior </LOCATION>. When he went to court, <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON> received a conditional discharge and the judge told him he was a lucky man because he would n't have a criminal record. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> records as convictions all sentences handed down by <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> courts _ discharges included. `` As far as we are concerned, a conditional discharge is the same thing as a conviction,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, port director for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration at <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We do n't recognize Canadian pardons either.'' <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON>'s experience `` points out something pretty outrageous,'' said <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON>. `` The whole intent of the discharge provisions in Canadian law is to remove any stigma, any prejudice attached to the person involved. `` But what's really amazing here is we are supplying -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials -RRB- with information about discharges, knowing it is being used in a manner that clearly undermines the intent of Canadian law.'' The legal hitch meant trouble for <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON>, a woodworker. When he was refused entry to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in March at <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON> _ determined not to cancel a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation _ tried again down the road at the Ivy <LOCATION> Lea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Gananoque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. Another computer check showed <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON> had tried to cross the border only a few hours before, and <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON> says <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customs officials held him for 4 -LCB- hours for questioning. He said he was was photographed, fingerprinted, and officials confiscated his girlfriend's pickup truck and sent him back across the bridge on foot to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Six months later, <PERSON> Schinkel </PERSON> says, he got the truck back after paying a $ 500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> penalty.

 An off-course bull moose nicknamed <PERSON> Bullwinkle </PERSON> was looking for a mate, but probably attracted only camera-toting spectators. On Saturday morning, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonsall </PERSON> said the 6-foot-tall, 900-pound moose stopped for a drink at a drainage ditch at his farm about 10 miles west of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION>, a southwest <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> town of 15,000 people. The moose, which sports a hefty set of antlers, spent the day there, lying under some trees and allowing 50 to 75 sightseers to get a good look. `` A lot of neighbors stopped by to take pictures, and he did n't seem to mind that,'' <PERSON> Bonsall </PERSON> said `` He'd just sit there and look at you. He did have some dogs bark at him. He got up and chased one of them a little bit.'' By Sunday morning, <PERSON> Bonsall </PERSON> said the moose hit the road. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bullwinkle </PERSON> may be the same bull moose that moved through <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> this fall and was last seen in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` It sounds like the same one,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehlebracht </PERSON>, a conservation officer. He said the moose was seen around the <LOCATION> Saline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in September, then traveled through <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> before being spotted in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. That moose, which had a 40-inch rack of antlers, was one of two moose spotted in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> this fall. <PERSON> Ehlebracht </PERSON> said moose visits to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> are unusual, but during the fall mating season, a bull moose will take off looking for a place to call home and `` just keep right on going.''

 <PERSON> BRIAN </PERSON> <PERSON> MULRONEY </PERSON> He led the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a smashing victory in 1984 and became prime minister.

The 49-year-old <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> eased smoothly from being a lawyer to his successful political career. He is a strong, emphatic public speaker. His term was marked by general economic prosperity during which more than 1 million jobs were created and inflation remained stable at about 4 percent.

 Here are some facts and figures on the Canadian election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE STAKES _ Canadians are electing a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> newly expanded to 295 seats, so a party needs 148 seats to form a majority government.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE VOTERS _ There are 17.1 million eligible voters. Polls open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. in each district. Across the nation that means they open at 7:30 a.m. EST in <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> and close at 11 p.m. EST in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The first returns are expected about 9 p.m. EST, but it could be well into the night before the outcome is clear. Voter turnout in the last Canadian national election on Sept. 4, 1984, was 75 percent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE MAJOR PARTIES _ They are the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>. In 1984, the Conservatives won 211 seats, the Liberals 40, the New Democrats 30, and there was one independent. The House of Commons then had 282 seats.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 THE KEY ISSUE _ The free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 overshadowed all other issues in the seven-week campaign. The Conservatives say the agreement will guarantee future Canadian prosperity by securing access to the larger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The Liberals and New Democrats oppose the pact, saying it endangers Canadian sovereignty and such crucial social programs as senior pensions and health care. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved the agreement, but it still needs final Canadian parliamentary approval. Only a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> majority government ensures that the agreement will proceed.

 You'd think an 81-year-old Texan would be satisfied with a string of careers that reads: star of radio, records, movies and TV, broadcast czar, real estate tycoon, baseball mogul. But singing cowboy <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> is back in the saddle with a new pursuit: preserver of the American West, real and legendary, at a museum underwritten with more than $ 50 million from his foundations. The <ORGANIZATION> Gene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, which opens Tuesday, traces the West from prehistory to conquistadores to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> to cowboys to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> images. It's meant as a gift to the world, not a monument to himself, said <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>, who first sang on radio in 1928, made 95 films, had a TV show from 1950 to 1955, and cut 635 records, including `` Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' `` Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine,'' and the signature `` Back in the Saddle Again.'' <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> hung up his performing spurs in 1956, and by the mid -'60s owned part or all of nine radio and TV stations, four hotels, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>, 16,000 acres in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, oil, music publishing, a movie Along the way he started collecting Western memorabilia and art. `` I felt that I owed something. The West has been very kind to me over the years,'' said <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>, whose net worth is about $ 230 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> magazine. `` I figured that the least I could do is leave something for the youth so they can see what it was all about.'' <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>'s tile-dotted, Spanish-style museum has seven main galleries with 51,000 square feet of space, each featuring a `` spirit'' or aspect of the West. The building cost $ 34 million and houses $ 20 million worth of exhibits. It has two exhibition halls, a theater, library and restaurant on 13 acres in <LOCATION> Griffith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` He had been thinking about this for 30 years, 40 years, collecting artifacts of the West as he went from town to town,'' said the museum's executive director, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>. The exhibits were designed by <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s Imagineering team to delight as well as instruct. Bridles and six-shooters gleam like jewels suspended on clear plexiglass holders; items behind glass in the galleries come to life in a 3-D movie with `` magic'' Disney pioneered at its theme parks. The aim is to capture not only the West romanticized by artists, authors and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, but the reality of frontier life, said curator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nottage </PERSON>. `` You expect that someone is going to save pistols owned by <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>, so it's not surprising that we have those,'' <PERSON> Nottage </PERSON> said. `` The hard items to find are the common ones. `` So we're proud of things like a simple day dress from the 1840s. What are the odds of an item like that surviving?'' <PERSON> Nottage </PERSON> shows off a collections of items used by Mexican cowboys, the original range riders, such as a mid-1700s <LOCATION> Saltillo </LOCATION> serape worn to ward off the weather. He hopes to expand the museum's displays of items about women, minorities and business people in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. But it's the romance of the dime novel and matinee that's the long suit for now. Visitors can toss a leg over a saddle and fire a six-shooter as they become part of a `` movie'' using the television technique that superimposes weather reporters over their weather maps. Or they can just peruse: _ Guns owned by <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>; saddles from <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cody </ORGANIZATION> and bronc-busting legend <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canutt </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>'s own guitars, their necks inlaid with his name in mother-of-pearl _ <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMille </PERSON>'s camera from the 1914 version of `` The Squaw Man,'' the Western often described as the first full-length picture shot in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> _ Costume after costume: Tonto and the Lone Ranger's get-ups, <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>'s `` Pale Rider'' long coat, the eye-assaulting glitter of country-western outfits from Nudie's Rodeo Tailors of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohlin </PERSON> show saddles dripping with what looks like a ton of silver Among <PERSON> Autry </PERSON>'s favorite items are an 1870s-era steam fire engine from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, a collection of <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> memorabilia, and a collection of more than 100 guns from Colt, including several made for presidents, which <PERSON> Autry </PERSON> purchased from the famous firearms company. `` They were actually offered more money than I paid for it,'' he said. `` But whoever was bidding on it was going to sell some of the most important items, maybe trying to get their money back. So I told the people at Colt the collection would not be broken up.''

 For the 10th straight year, Japanese named the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as their most trustworthy ally, but a simultaneous survey on the other side of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> found <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> fell to 11th place among nations Americans trust. The annual poll, conducted in September and published today in the <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest-circulation newspaper, asked people to choose the most trustworthy from a list of 30 countries.

 Radical students yelling `` Yankee go home!'' tried to storm the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s information office today and smashed its lobby with steel rods before being repulsed by police, authorities said. Eight police officers and two of the attackers were hurt, police said, adding that one officer was hospitalized in serious condition. Ten of the students were arrested in the assault, the latest in a series of attacks by radicals on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other Korean cities. Police officers, who declined to be named, said about 15 students rushed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> USIS </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- office in the heart of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> shortly after noon. The students hurled a firebomb that caused an explosion, and swept past police guards. Screaming anti-American slogans, the students forced their way through the main door into the lobby, police said. They could not get through a second door into the building and began smashing the lobby with the steel rods. Riot police attacked the protesters with tear gas and overpowered them during a fight lasting several minutes, police said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials said no Americans were injured in the attack. The 15-minute incident occurred at lunchtime when the building was nearly empty, they said. Senior police officers said the students were seeking an end to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> influence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and wanted the removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces based in the country. Anti-American students set fire to nine vehicles in an attack Thursday night on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military housing complex in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and injured two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers. Radicals also staged numerous anti-American demonstrations in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> this summer. The <ORGANIZATION> USIS </ORGANIZATION> office, which provides a library and other services for Koreans, has been attacked several times by radicals in recent years. The office is a block from city hall and several hundred yards from the embassy. Radicals are demanding the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. The radicals contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supported authoritarian rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and seeks to dominate the nation. American troops have been based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces intervened to aid the south against a 1950 invasion by communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that triggered the Korean War.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> should help promote human rights in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> instead of turning its back on abuses for the sake of stability, a private American human rights monitoring organization said. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch said in a report released Sunday that rights abuses, including torture by police and political killings on the <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> archipelago continue but that the region is stable enough for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to press its ally for more improvements. `` Neither the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy nor the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has placed promotion of human rights high on its agenda of foreign policy goals in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch said. `` These issues demand increased attention among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials -LRB- because -RRB- throughout the 1980s, formal controls on political life ... have expanded and ... and a broadening cross-section of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> society has suffered politically-motivated human rights violations'' including police torture and killings and lack of free press or speech. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch attributed American silence to `` the persuasive power of the ` cult of stability''' among <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> policymakers. <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> `` has deftly deflected criticism from abroad by continuing to evoke images of the instability associated with the tenure of President <PERSON> Sukarno </PERSON>,'' who ruled with communist support before <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> took power in 1965. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch singled out the former Portugese colony of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> annexed 13 years ago, as an example of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s violation of human rights despite what the report said were improvements on the island Residents `` continue to suffer daily violations of fundamental rights'' and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> fails to account for thousands of missing people believed killed in custody. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Watch is affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Americas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Watch, which monitors compliance with the 1975 <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> conference agreements on security and cooperation.

<HEAD>Egypt, China Recognize Palestinian State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the only <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country formally at peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, has recognized the newly proclaimed Palestinian state and expressed hope its declaration will contribute to peace and stability in the region. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also announced Sunday it had recognized the state declared last Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, making it the largest Communist country to back the Palestinian claim to a homeland. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has expressed support `` in essence'' of a new Palestinian state, but has yet to issue formal recognition. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s statement came a few hours after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, called on Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> to brief him on the Israeli government's position regarding the newly proclaimed state. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, proclaimed the state _ in Israeli-occupied territory with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital _ and also endorsed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, implying recognition of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has rejected the move, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has neither explicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> nor renounced terrorism. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Sunday he was upset by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s decision. `` I regret it very much,'' he said without elaboration. More than 30 countries, most of them Moslem, have recognized the Palestinian state. An Egyptian government communique said Sunday that `` as <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> blesses this constructive step, it hopes that it -LRB- the proclamation -RRB- would serve the cause of peace and stability in the region.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have argued that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would violate the 1978 Camp David accords between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> if it recognized the Palestinian state. The U.S.-mediated Camp David pact called for the final status of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, to be negotiated in peace talks among parties to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. In the territories, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> are engaged in an 11-month uprising that has claimed the lives of more than 310 Palestinians and of 11 Jews. The Egyptian statement on Sunday, read to reporters and carried by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said its recognition should be effective Nov. 15, the day the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> body proclaimed the state. The statement complained that `` some quarters'' have persisted in casting doubt on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s position of support. `` To uproot these doubts ... <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> hereby affirms its recognition of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> independent state according to the points that came in the political statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Palestinian parliament -RRB- and considers this recognition effective since Nov. 15.'' The Chinese statement, carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` The <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, with full respect for the choice made by the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people, has decided to recognize the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> pressed his efforts Sunday to gain more recognition. He and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> urged non-aligned countries to recognize fully the newly declared state, the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, the agency said both voiced `` satisfaction over the historical decisions'' taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The two were meeting in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said Sunday the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conditions to join in <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace talks and suggested <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were blocking peace. `` I believe the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has gone as far as it was asked to go and has contributed its share for progress toward a just and comprehensive peace,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television's `` Face the Nation.''

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest supermarket chains is encouraging its workers to back the U.S.-Canadian free trade pact, joining several other companies using similar tactics to try to affect today's elections. Along with their paychecks last Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Loblaws </ORGANIZATION> workers received a seven-page letter from company president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> supporting the free trade accord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Loblaws letter claims the deal, which requires Canadian parliamentary ratification, could knock 8,000 Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 6,480 -RRB- off the price of a house `` or an extra $ 20 -LRB- Canadian -RRB- off the price of winter coats for the kids this year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has already approved the measure. At least one worker thinks the letter is an attempt to intimidate employees into voting for the Progressive Conservatives, the governing party and architects of the controversial deal. The Liberals and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> oppose the pact. `` They should give people free choice. That's the way it's supposed to be,'' one <ORGANIZATION> Loblaws </ORGANIZATION> worker was quoted as telling the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` I do n't think they should do anything like that A company spokesman denied the letter is meant to sway workers into voting for the Conservatives. `` It was a personal message that was meant to be non-political in nature,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Loblaws </ORGANIZATION> vice-president of merchandising and development. The retail giant, which employs 33,000 workers at stores across the country, is one of several large corporations to have entered the free-trade debate by calling on workers to support the deal. <ORGANIZATION> Stelco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> steel manufacturer with 12,500 employees, and <ORGANIZATION> Canadair </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> aircraft company, have distribted similar letters to their workers. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> made a video of president <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> defending the deal. The tapes were sent to the company's factories in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>. Some plants chose not to show the video to employees, he added. Several other companies have distributed pro-free trade leaflets produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and Job Opportunities.

<HEAD>Testimony Of 11-Year-Old Represents Trend Toward Child Witnesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only his head and shoulders were visible above the witness box as the boy calmly told a murder trial jury how, when he was 2 years and 10 months old, he watched as his aunt was grabbed and thrown down by a man with a knife. `` I saw a knife in his case on his belt _ I thought it was a gun,'' the boy said softly, recounting events that took place eight years ago. `` She was, like, pulling around his shoulders and pushing him away from her.'' From divorce battles to child abuse cases to murder trials, child witnesses, once rarely seen in court, are appearing regularly in thousands of proceedings, legal and psychiatric experts said. Opinion varies widely on the reliability of child witnesses and on whether the stress they suffer in a courtroom is worth the testimony they provide. Psychiatrists cite symptoms like nightmares, confusion and guilt in young witnesses. `` It's not that difficult at all to get a child to say ` nay' to questions the child was saying ` yea' to a few minutes before,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondano </PERSON>, who was involved in a child abuse case against a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> day care center, said of cross-examining children. `` You do n't know whether they are with you or in a childlike world.'' Prosecutors said the testimony of the 11-year-old boy in <ORGANIZATION> Middlesex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last month was critical in the murder case against <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was accused of stabbing the boy's 12-year-old aunt to death But the boy could n't positively identify <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as the attacker, the jury failed to reach a verdict, and the case must be retried. Many methods have been used to smooth the road for child witnesses. Some have been struck down as unconstitutional, others have withstood appeals. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, a child frozen with fear was permitted to testify from beneath the prosecutor's table. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a 5-year-old used a doll to demonstrate how her father allegedly beat her younger sister. As a hushed courtroom watched, the girl tossed the doll in the air. After it landed on the floor, the girl walked down from the witness stand and began punching it in the stomach. `` Where child victims used to be rare, now you're seeing many more children coming into the system and that has required making some accommodations,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant district attorney who has worked on many child abuse cases. Other changes include mandatory psychiatric evaluations before a child is allowed to testify; special training for judges handling child witnesses; and victim-witness advocates in prosecutors' offices who work with families to make the experience less stressful `` Children are quite honest,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardone </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s child psychology center, who frequently evaluates potential child witnesses. `` If they are giving you an accurate version, they are consistent,'' he said. `` A lot of people are concerned they are being prepped. You usually can tell.'' The stress associated with testifying can be especially acute when a child is asked to give evidence against a parent or other relative in a child abuse case, said Dr. <PERSON> Alayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, chief of child psychiatry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>. Problems can include `` staying awake at night, ruminating about what they said and feeling responsible for the person being in prison, and very sorry,'' she said. The younger the witness, the more acute the stress, said <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, adding that when she began her career in 1973 such cases were `` extraordinarily rare.'' The number of child abuse cases nationwide has more than tripled in a decade, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protecting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>, a Denver-based organization. In 1976 there were 669,000 cases but by 1986 the number jumped to 2.1 million. Of those, about 40 percent are `` substantiated'' to the point where they may be brought to trial, said association researcher <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>. In most of those trials, the testimony of the child victim is required to prosecute the case. Judges are less willing to put children through the trauma of testimony in divorce and custody battles than in criminal cases, but children are often asked to take sides in a battle between parents. Parents sometimes falsely accuse one another of sexual abuse to win custody, <PERSON> Yates </PERSON> said. `` The child is liable to lose contact with a father who's a valuable parent and sometimes whether the abuse happened or not, they come to the feeling that it must have happened,'' she said.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the Arab-American whose appointment as White House chief of staff upset some Jews, says the key to a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace is `` to guarantee the integrity and strength of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a sovereign nation.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> made the statement in an interview published today in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, adding that he expected President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and incoming Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to pursue peace in the region. `` I think they're smart enough to know that it's in this country's -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- interest to deal with the tough issues and no one can stay that it's not one of the great tough issues,'' he said, referring to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. When asked if he had strong feelings about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> because of his Arab ancestry, he replied: `` I have feelings in this sense: I think that ... as time has moved forward that we have opportunities to move toward peace.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> it was `` in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interest, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' interest, frankly everyone's interest, to achieve peace and tranquility in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' `` For example,'' he said, `` for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s long-term economic situation, peace would be a tremendous asset. ... To stay under the constant tension that we seen is over the past few decades is not good.'' Noting that assuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s sovereignty was the key to any peace settlement, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said: `` That has to be made clear.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who is of Lebanese descent, aroused anger among some Israeli and American Jews when as governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> he refused to sign a petition calling for repeal of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution equating Zionism with racism.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Billiard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> has 39 tournament pool tables, no beer, no jukebox and a dress code. And the posh billiard parlor is packed with the game's new upscale clientele. The club opened in July on the third floor of a former warehouse, and similar clubs have been popping up in cities across the country. Patrons include men and women, most between 25 and 40, many on dates. No betting is allowed, and a resident professional gives lessons for $ 25 an hour. The tables are in spacious rows on a polished maple floor surrounded by a brass railing and deep carpeting. Dark green curtains hold back sunlight from arched windows. Many evenings, players must take numbers and cool their cues in an adjoining cafe until a table opens. Corporate customers, mainly brokerage firms and management consultants, have taken to renting a back room and part of the main floor for private parties. Such success has not gone unnoticed. Manager and co-owner <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> said prospective pool hall owners from other cities have been coming through <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON>'s at a rate of about one a week. Upscale pool halls have opened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and others are planned in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON>, director of operations for <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest pool table manufacturer. `` The old image of pool was that it was dangerous, there were hustlers, dark rooms, grubbiness, people losing money, people getting robbed,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cord </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Billiard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` But lately pool is associated more with something being classy. There are these classy rooms opening up in the big cities, and there is constantly magazine advertising using pool tables. You see a slinky lady leaning up against a table, and a guy in a tuxedo, advertising <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>. The same thing with <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dior </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jordache </PERSON> _ they've all done that.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON>, whose family firm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has made custom pool tables since 1923, said pocket billiards was a gentleman's game fancied by railroad magnates and oil tycoons from the 1890s until the 1930s. But with its spread to neighborhood bars and bowling alleys during and after World War II, it took on a tough-guy image. <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON> attributed the game's `` yuppie attraction'' both to the Madison Avenue ad campaigns and to a 1986 movie, `` The Color of Money,'' which starred <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruise </PERSON> as pool hotshots. <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> won an Oscar for recreating `` Fast <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Felson </PERSON>, the character he played in the 1961 movie, `` The Hustler.'' Some think the upscale pool craze began in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> two years ago, after `` The Color of Money'' played there. <PERSON> Bakula </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> has shipped more than 1,000 tables to the Orient over the last two years. <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> doubled its annual production from 8,000 to 16,000 tables since 1986, he said, but still could not keep up with the demand last year and had to turn away some Japanese orders.

<HEAD>Southern Florida Hub For Illegal Animal Imports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The recent conviction of a ring charged with smuggling exotic birds from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> provided a glimpse into the lucrative enterprise of importing illegal animals, which has found a base of operations in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` There is an insatiable appetite for animals of all kinds,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, one of nine special state wildlife agents in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> whose job includes stalking animal smuggling operations. `` If you have the money, you can get the animal. That's how it goes.'' Subtropical <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a hub for Latin American cargo flights, has emerged as the nation's center for legitimate exotic animal import firms, whose inventories range from darting fish to sluggish tree sloths. But demand by high-paying customers tempts some of the companies to forge inventories and try other schemes to bring in prohibited animals as well. The smugglers, like the parrot ring, try to blend into the legal animal traffic and hope to escape notice from inspectors, said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. `` I've seen fake bottoms in crates, fake invoices, boxes marked they are filled with venomous snakes to try to discourage inspection. People will try just about anything to get these animals in,'' said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. `` I'm to the point now where nothing shocks me.'' Officials estimate 36 companies and 300 individuals in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are licensed by the state to deal in the international animal trade. Many bring in several large shipments of fish, mammals or reptiles each week, with only a handful of state and federal inspectors to check the contents. `` We're overwhelmed,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` If we could check all the shipments we would. The sheer volume of the animal traffic is just too much.'' Animals imports are regulated by state statutes and other laws such as the Lacey Act, which bans interstate transportation of rare species. Internationally, inspectors watch for violations of the 8-year-old Covenant on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION>, an agreement signed by 120 nations that sets bans on some animals and strict limits on others. But the more scarce an animal becomes, the more it's sought by smugglers. Some exotic birds, such as the black-palmed cockatoo from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, fetch up to $ 25,000 each. A <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger brings between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000. `` We see a lot of these real expensive animals turn up in the homes of the drug dealers down here,'' said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. `` Among the dopers, having these animals is a real status symbol.'' Federal drug agents found a small zoo, including two cheetahs and a leopard when they raided the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> property of an alleged drug trafficker last summer. `` Animals are affected by trends, just like fashion,'' said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. `` One time cobras were popular. Then it was black animals. Then albino animals were hot. It comes in cycles.'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s single best advantage is surprise. Unannounced, he combs the warehouses around southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and pokes into cages and fish tanks. `` It's like going to a casino,'' he said. `` You never know when you'll hit the jackpot.''

<HEAD>Federal Judge Bars Phila. From Cutting Aid to Retarded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has barred the city and state from cutting off services to 9,000 retarded Philadelphians who live at home, saying the `` irrational'' decision threatened the recipients' health and safety. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> issued a permanent injunction forbidding <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and the state from eliminating vocational, family-support, early-intervention, recreational and case-management services to mentally retarded people who live with their families. In his ruling Thursday, the judge said that to deprive mentally retarded people of services they need for living and working would result in `` irreparable injury'' and `` cause serious regression to many.'' He also said it would violate the equal-protection and due-process clauses of the Constitution. The order will continue until further notice from the court, the judge said. A projected $ 6.8 million shortage in state funds prompted the city in June to announced plans to reduce or eliminate services for mentally retarded Philadelphians who live at home and are registered with the city for mental-retardation assistance. Services for mentally retarded people in state-funded group homes were not affected. The judge ruled that the city's decision affecting services to the retarded living at home and not to those living in state-funded residences was arbitrary. `` There has been a lack of judgment ... an irrational lack of fairness. The Constitution demands that defendants should have found a better way to resolve the problem,'' <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> wrote. The judge did not say whether the city or state must fund the services. He did note, however, that the city `` has contributed $ 3 million annually in excess of its 10 percent match.'' State law requires the state to provide 90 percent of the funding for such services and counties are to pay 10 percent and provide the services themselves. In July, 32 people and the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handicapped </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, filed a class-action lawsuit against the city and state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> alleging that the city's mentally retarded were being denied their rights to `` lifelong community support.'' <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order, effective Aug. 1, that prohibited a cutback in services and later extended it until last Friday. The attorney for the plaintiffs, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferleger </PERSON>, hailed the ruling as `` a landmark.'' `` No court has ever held that there is a guaranteed right to community services for people with retardation living at home,'' Ferleger said. Deputy City Solicitor <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilim </PERSON> said the city would review the opinion before deciding how to proceed.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities are investigating reports that two tear gas canisters exploded outside a nightclub near an American base on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said today. The incident was the latest in a series of mishaps to plague <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in this country. On Friday, the commander of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destroyer was relieved of his post after practice shells from his ship reportedly missed hitting a Japanese vessel by 330 yards. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> lodged a protest over the Nov. 9 incident off <LOCATION> Boso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was relieved of command of the guided missile destroyer USS Towers and transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Destroyer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 15, military spokesman <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. In October, rifle bullets struck a civilian housing area near a firing range on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. Earlier this month, two Marine helicopters collided in flight over the southern island, killing four servicemen. About 46,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in the country under the U.S.-Japan mutual security pact. No injuries or damages were reported in the latest incident in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, Marine Master Gunnery Sgt. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said, but the blasts sent scores of crying, choking people into the streets late Saturday.

 The convictions of mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and 16 associates have taken `` the guts out'' of a deadly Philadelphia-southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> crime family, a prosecutor says. A federal jury Saturday night convicted <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, 59, and 16 associates in a racketeering conspiracy that included murder, drug dealing, loan-sharking and illegal gambling. `` One of the things that this case did was it broke the myth of the Mafia's invincibility,'' said assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pichini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pichini </PERSON> said the convictions crippled the crime family because of the number of defendants involved and their high rankings in the organization. `` With one conviction, we were able to take the guts out,'' <PERSON> Pichini </PERSON> said. Each defendant was found guilty on each of the two main conspiracy counts they faced. In addition, some were found guilty on other charges they faced individually. Sentencing was not immediately scheduled by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Antwerpen </PERSON>. All face possible sentences of from 40 to 55 years in prison. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> is already in prison on an unrelated conviction. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, said he would appeal the verdict, reached after 26 hours of jury deliberations. `` I think in terms of taking down the entire power structure of the family, this is the first time that that has really occurred,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Organized Crime Strike Force in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` What we've done here is really stopped them.'' While other convicted mob leaders, such as the late <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Genovese </PERSON>, continued to rule during jail terms, law enforcement officials said <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> does n't have the clout, influence or savvy to follow suit. `` I believe <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>'s days as a leader in organized crime are over,'' said Col. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Pichini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> cautioned that the verdict does n't mean the end of organized crime in the area Because <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> has been lucrative, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> mobsters may move in, <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> is serving a 14-year prison term for conspiring to extort $ 1 million from a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> developer. He and six others still face conspiracy charges in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in the 1985 gangland-style slaying of mob associate <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> `` Frankie Flowers'' <PERSON> D'Alfonso </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Thailand Opens Historical City after Decades of Restoration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SUKHOTHAI, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, after 25 years of excavation and restoration, has unveiled one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s great Buddhist centers and an ancient royal capital from its `` Golden Age.'' Peeling away centuries of jungle growth and soil, experts have partially restored 193 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples, moats, kiln sites and other structures which 700 years ago were part of the powerful city of <LOCATION> Sukhothai </LOCATION>. These form the 27-square-mile <ORGANIZATION> Sukhothai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, which was formally opened although the public has had access to the area for some time. Officiating at Sunday's opening ceremonies was Princess <PERSON> Sirindhorn </PERSON>, a scholar of Thai culture and eldest daughter of King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON>, the latest in a royal line that Thais regard as having begun in 1253 with the first king of <LOCATION> Sukhothai </LOCATION>. The bid to save <LOCATION> Sukhothai </LOCATION> from destructive vegetation and thieves began in 1953 but stalled several years later. Work resumed in the mid-1960s and received a boost in 1978 when the <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization began a $ 10 million renovation plan. <LOCATION> Sukhothai </LOCATION> was included in <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign to restore 31 world cultural sites. Its opening comes during heightened consciousness in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> about the theft of its art treasures. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> returned an ancient stone sculpture smuggled out of the country to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1960s. Decapitated statues and pilfered kiln sites at <LOCATION> Sukhothai </LOCATION> are testimony to the loss of heritage, but a leading Thai art historian, Prince <PERSON> Subhadradis </PERSON> <PERSON> Diskul </PERSON>, told reporters recently that what remains within the guarded, well-attended park should be secure. However, other Thai experts have expressed concern that outlying areas where archaeological work is under way are vulnerable to antique hunters. Although <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> provided valuable expertise, the overall restoration concept was worked out by Thais and involved the use of non-original materials to flesh out temples and even the addition of missing parts to giant statues of the Lord <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>. Although a more `` purist'' approach is normally preferred in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the Thais argued that the restoration should appeal to the general public as well as to the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> faithful who do n't like to worship before headless images. The Thai government _ which avidly promotes tourism _ also hopes the restored monuments will attract more visitors. Officials say about 500,000 Thais and foreigners are expected to visit this year. Some view the tourist boom as a danger to the tranquility and natural beauty of the area. In the past, guidelines and regulations on tourist development in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> have been violated by private entrepreneurs. Beyond tourist revenue, officials say restoration of <LOCATION> Sukhothai </LOCATION> _ which translates as `` Dawn of Happiness'' _ is a national duty given the city's central place in <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> history and culture. The kingdom lasted less than 150 years but shaped many aspects of contemporary <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, including the Theravadda Buddhist religion. Thai script, notions of kingship and relatively egalitarian social relations were also developed. At its height the kingdom controlled an area stretching into modern-day <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Its artists and architects broke with the cultural dominance of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to create new styles, especially in depicting the <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON> in bronze images. But internal strife eventually weakened <LOCATION> Sukhothai </LOCATION>, and power shifted to the south and the kingdom of <LOCATION> Ayuthaya </LOCATION> in 1378. The capital itself was abandoned in the 16th century.

 Israeli troops shot to death a 22-year-old Palestinian and wounded 11 others in clashes in the occupied lands, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> moderates claimed the protracted uprising has increased prospects for peace. At a forum, six <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> moderates on Sunday praised the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> parliament-in-exile's declaration of an independent state as a message of peace and acceptance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence `` The declaration ... was a reward to the Palestinian people who have been struggling for 11 months and a message to the Israelis that the Palestinian people accept a Jewish and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state side-by-side,'' said <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a pro-PLO newspaper editor from east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON> said the revolt that pits rock-throwing Palestinian youths against heavily armed soldiers `` made the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> people realize that there were another people living under occupation here.'' Israeli leftists at the forum in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> echoed his sentiments. `` The point is no longer who controls the land,'' said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Izhar </PERSON>, an Israeli author. `` The point is we can no longer sit on the heads of 1.5 million Palestinians and rule their physical and political lives. This occupation is destroying us.'' <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, a leading peace activist, said, `` I think the chances for peace are better now than they ever were in the past.'' `` It's time to realize that rocks and bullets wo n't accomplish anything,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure the Arabs will make more concessions and then there will be pressure on -LRB- Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and American Jewry and he will be forced to moderate his position.'' On Sunday, the violence continued as one Palestinian was fatally wounded during an army raid in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Baqa </LOCATION>. Five Arabs were beaten during an Israeli army raid on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Madama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. Six others were wounded by bullets in incidents in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, hospital officials reported. Sunday's death raised to 314 the number of Palestinians killed since anti-Israel rioting began Dec. 8 in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Eleven Israelis have also died. Speaking in English to a largely Israeli audience in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, who has been mentioned as a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiator acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians, called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end the violence by negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are extending our hand with an olive branch to call to your neighbors to take the first step toward peace with us,'' he said. Israeli peace activists also called on their government to begin negotiations. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> pragmatism has come about despite <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s hostility,'' said <PERSON> Matti </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` I hope their pragmatism will soon be recognized in our community.'' But in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Cabinet called the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration of an independent state in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories `` a jumble of illusions.'' The government said the declaration could not contribute to peace because the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament had neither renounced terrorism nor explicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was and remains the main obstacle for peace and all those that support the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in this matter are hurting peace,'' an official statement released after Sunday's cabinet meeting said. Elsewhere, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was killed and four others injured when their armored personnel carrier overturned in a road accident Sunday in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the army said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the accident occurred north of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, two miles from the Israeli border.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has beatified <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>, praising the Philadelphia-born heiress-turned-nun for devoting her life and fortune to fighting racism against blacks and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. About 10,000 people packed <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica for Sunday's ceremony in which the pope also beatified three Franciscan missionaries stoned to death in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in the early 18th century In becoming `` blesseds'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the four took a step toward possible sainthood. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>, who was born in in 1858, became a nun in 1891 and founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament to work among blacks and Indians. She opened nearly 60 schools and missions, mostly in the West and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. A member of a prominent <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> banking family, she gave an estimated $ 20 million to further her order's work before her death at age 96 in 1955. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> `` seemed to grasp the fundamental truths which many of her contemporaries failed to grasp; for example, the truth about the equal dignity and worth of every human being, regardless of race or ethnic origin,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` In her day, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> and blacks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suffered great injustices as a result of racial prejudice,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in English. `` Seeing clearly the evil of this situation, she set out with determination to combat and overcome it.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> focused her efforts on establishing Catholic schools. He noted that <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1887 to ask Pope <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> XIII </PERSON> to send missionaries to her schools for Indians, and the pontiff persuaded her to become a missionary herself. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> established her first school in 1887: <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>. She opened other schools in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> The order also set up a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school system to serve blacks in 13 states, with 30 convents from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. In 1925, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> founded <ORGANIZATION> Xavier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the first predominantly black Catholic university in the country. Archbishop <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON> is remembered for `` her undaunted spirit of courageous initiative in addressing social inequities among minorities _ 100 years before such concern aroused public interest in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Among the more than 1,000 people who traveled from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the ceremony were Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krol </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; Sister <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, president of the order; about 200 black Catholics and dozens of American Indians. Also present were 22 distant cousins of <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>, including three current trustees at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded by her uncle, banker <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>, in 1891. There are no survivors of her immediate family. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> this year cleared the way for <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>'s beatification by approving a miracle attributed to her intercession <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutherman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, teen-ager who lost hearing in his right ear from an infection, reportedly regained hearing in 1974 after his parents prayed for <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Drexel </PERSON>'s intervention. To become a saint, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would have to confirm a second miracle attributed to her intercession. The Franciscans beatified were German <PERSON> Liberato </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> and Italians <PERSON> Samuele </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzorati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Pio </PERSON> <PERSON> Faoli </PERSON>. The three were martyred on March 3, 1716, outside <LOCATION> Gondar </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The three had been sent to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to open ecumenical dialogue with the Abyssinian church but were condemned for their religious work and stoned to death.

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and three members of a Soviet volunteer organization have agreed to work jointly on housing projects for the needy next summer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> met Sunday with the Soviet delegation at his home in Plains. He is active in Habitat for Humanity, a group that builds homes for the working poor. `` One of the things they -LRB- the Russians -RRB- wanted to do was housing work for the benefit of low-income people with children, and Habitat fit the bill,'' said <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, Habitat's executive director, who also attended the meeting with the Soviets. `` We decided that next summer a group of 10 Soviets will come to <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> and work with 10 Americans on the Habitat project there for five or six weeks,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. `` Then the group will go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and work on a similar project there.'' Habitat has conducted home-building projects in more than 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities as well as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and developing nations. The Soviets delagation are members of a private volunteer organization, the Soviet Peace Fund, and were invited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by Ploughshares, a Seattle-based organization. The Soviet delegation included <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Savitskaya </PERSON>, the first woman cosmonaut to walk in space. `` It's very important to look at each other eye to eye,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Savitskaya </PERSON>, who added that the project will help promote peace. `` This will help us to see there are not enemies among us but good friends.'' The project's ultimate goal is to have the Soviets and Americans working side-by-side in developing nations, organizers said, but no decision on that was reached.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> was quoted as saying today he wants to resolve the controversy involving his predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, and indicated the former leader would be pardoned. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> made the remarks as the 56-year-old <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> reportedly was preparing to make a public apology for alleged corruption and other misdeeds during his seven-year term in office. `` I will take actions under the principle that any wrongdoings by a chief executive should be dealt with politically and that any political reprisal would only hurt democratic development,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shinmun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> had planned to leave <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Tuesday to live in seclusion in the countryside, but the plan was delayed because of difficulty in finding him a safe, rural home, news reports said. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> is expected to apologize at a natioally televised news conference Wednesday, newspapers quoted <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s aides as saying. He also is to turn over most of his wealth to the government and accept rural exile, a traditional way of repentence for disgraced Korean leaders. The former president, who stepped down in February, denies any personal wrongdoing. But about a dozen of his relatives and associates have been convicted or charged with corruption involving millions of dollars in public funds. <ORGANIZATION> Dong-A-Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> would leave immmediately after reading his statement Wednesday to live in a mountainside Buddhist temple or near an army unit in the northern part of the country. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, the paper said, needs a refuge where he will be safe from attacks by radicals and other opponents. Other newspapers said he might move to the countryside in central <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but not to his hometown in the south, where residents reportedly oppose his return. National Assembly hearings on abuses under the Chun government focused today on attempts to stifle press freedom. More than 700 journalists were blacklisted and many newspaper and broadcast operations were placed under state control by the Chun administration. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has been a virtual prisoner in his luxurious <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> house, guarded by hundreds of riot police to prevent attacks by dissidents. Opposition groups have held major protests and tried to march on his home to demand his arrest. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government is under criticism for trying to protect <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and the government is trying to defuse public anger without being implicated in the furor. <PERSON> Yonhap </PERSON>, the South Korean news agency, said the government was considering a probe by prosecutors against <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> if his apology and surrender of property does not satisfy the public. There have been increasing numbers of street protests urging <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s arrest in recent weeks. Over the weekend, thousands of students and dissidents battled riot police in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after police stopped a march to <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s house. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former general, took power with military backing in 1980. He was succeeded by <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, another former general and a close <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> associate.

<HEAD>Magistrate Dismisses Assassin's Complaint</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A magistrate today dismissed a complaint against two policemen by a Sikh convicted of assassinating former Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in 1984, news reports said. Magistrate <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauba </PERSON> said <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s complaint amounted `` to reopening the judgment in the <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> murder case,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>. In a complaint filed Oct. 10, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said two members of Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s security force fired at him after he was captured and disarmed. He claimed he shot Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> inadvertently in an attempt to shoot down who he said were the real assassins _ the two policemen who fired at him. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was gunned down Oct. 31, 1984, in the garden of her official residence by <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and a fellow Sikh bodyguard, <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. In resulting shooting, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was severely injured and <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was killed. The two men were not related. After an eight-month trial in 1986, <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was convicted of murdering Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and sentenced to death. <PERSON> Beant </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s maternal uncle, <PERSON> Kehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was convicted of conspiring with the assassins and also got the death penalty. `` It is most unnatural that Satwant would have hidden truth of this nature throughout the trial of a case where his own life was at stake,'' <PERSON> Gauba </PERSON> said, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Rupinder </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sodhi </PERSON>, said he would appeal. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> apparently was shot and killed in retaliation for an army raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest shrine It was used as a base by militant Sikhs fighting for an independent homeland in the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. At least 1,200 people, mostly Sikhs, died in the assault. Militant Sikhs have waged a bloody guerrilla war since 1982. They claim they are discriminated against by the majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s population but are in a slight majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Minister Says Rebel Leader Denies Ordering Plane Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A southern rebel leader denied ordering missile attacks on aircraft, including one that damaged a plane carrying many of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s military heirarchy, a government minister said today. The plane carried 60 people, including Defense Minister <PERSON> Abdul-Maguid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Omer </PERSON>, minister for construction and public works, said rebel commander <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> said he has held off ordering his <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to escalate the war, even though a tentative new agreement to end 5 -LCB- years of civil war has not been implemented. <PERSON> Omer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> made the statements in a telephone conversation Sunday with his negotiating partner, <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON>. On Sunday, military spokesman Brig. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> blamed the incident on <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>'s rebels. After <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>'s comments, Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> said the incident proved <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> has `` lost credibility. The rebel movement is not serious about its peace claims.'' <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON> is patriarch of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a junior partner in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s governing coalition. <PERSON> Omer </PERSON> said Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> was with <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON> when <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> told him he gave no orders for `` shooting this plane or any other plane.'' <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> spoke from his headquarters in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Last Thursday, unidentified men fired a SAM-7 missile at a Hercules C-130 just after it took off from the besieged city of <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> with the defense minister, the army commander-in-chief and other top military commanders aboard. The missile badly damaged the plane's engine and control system. But the pilot managed to maintain control and landed without injury or other damage. Rebel broadcasts from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> took responsibility for the shooting down of two civilian aircraft in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in 1986 and 1987 that killed more than 70 people. The first, in August 1986, prompted <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> to cease contacts with rebel leaders that had held early promise of agreement. The incident came a day after an initial cease-fire agreement was signed in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> and other political leaders have endorsed the peace initiative, although the prime minister has not discussed the issue publicly since the shooting. <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> took up arms in 1983 in a quest for autonomy and economic, administrative and social reforms in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. Its Christian and animist African-descended people traditionally have been dominated by the ethnic Arab Moslems of the north.

<HEAD>Judge Lets Stand $700,000 Verdict Against Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has refused to set aside a $ 700,000 award against two newspapers, saying they committed `` calculated misdeeds'' when they published a source's name after promising him confidentiality. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest papers, said they were not surprised by Saturday's ruling and would appeal. The case concerns a suit filed by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who claimed during trial in July that he lost his advertising job after the newspapers misrepresented and breached an oral contract they made to keep his name out of a politically sensitive story. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> had leaked court documents to reporters during the 1982 gubernatorial campaign that revealed that <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a candidate for lieutenant governor, had been arrested for shoplifting several years earlier. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who worked for rival gubernatorial candidate <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, provided the information on the condition that he not be identified as the source. Editors at the newspapers testified that they overruled their reporters' promises of anonymity because the public had the right to know the information came from the <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> campaign. But Hennepin County District Judge <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Knoll </PERSON> ruled that the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press did not shield the newspapers against <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s breach of contract claim. `` The courts have made it clear that no First Amendment interest exists in protecting news media from calculated misdeeds,' `` Knoll's memorandum said. `` Certainly, the knowing and willful breach of a legally sufficient contract after hours of thought and discussion by corporate officers can fairly be characterized as a calculated misdeed.''' <PERSON> Knoll </PERSON> also dismissed the newspapers' argument that a relationship between a reporter and a source is anything other than commercial. `` The advertising war currently being waged by one -LRB- newspaper -RRB- against the other is ample evidence of the profit motive underlying their operations,'' he said. `` It's our intent to appeal,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were hoping for a different outcome, but this was not unanticipated.'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, managing editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, said his newspaper also will appeal the decision to the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>.

 The coroner's report on <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' death says the Greek heiress died of natural causes, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacion </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The 37-year-old daughter of Greek shipping tycoon <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> died Saturday of an apparent heart attack at the country club home of friends. Autopsy results on the cause of death are expected to be released today. The coroner's report is key to the release of the body for burial in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, and might provide details of Miss Onassis' death. The report was to be delivered today to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Nino </PERSON>. In another development, three jars of medicine and other evidence found in Miss Onassis' bedroom were taken by police Sunday for analysis, the private news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> said today. Another bottle of pills reportedly was missing. One of three doctors who allegedly examined Miss Onassis at the country club and pronounced her dead there was questioned by police and two judges who have jurisdiction in the case, DyN reported. Miss Onassis frequently dieted to combat an obesity problem and was known to take diet pills. It was not known if she was on diet pills at the time of her death. Judge <PERSON> Nino </PERSON> tentatively ruled the death suspicious because the body arrived dead at the hospital. The coroner's report he ordered is based on an autopsy conducted Saturday night. A federal judge on Sunday night prohibited the removal of Miss Onassis' body from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> without his authorization, citing procedural errors in transfering the body from his district to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> was the stepdaughter of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, the widow of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who married <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> in 1968. In <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the family's <ORGANIZATION> Springfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> company said Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> will be buried on her family's island, Skorpios, off northwest <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> later this week The spokesman said the <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> fortune had been left to the daughter born in 1985 to Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> and her fourth husband, <PERSON> Thierry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON>. `` The entire fortune goes to little <ORGANIZATION> Athena </ORGANIZATION>,'' the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Mr. <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> will have custody of the child until she comes of age.'' Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, who made headlines with her jet-setting lifestyle and four marriages, all of which ended in divorce, married <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> in March 1984 and filed for divorce eight months later. Half of the estimated $ 1 billion family fortune went to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> upon her father's death in 1975. The other half is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Alexander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Onassis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which was set up in memory of <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' only son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who died in a 1973 plane crash. Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> was visiting the country home of <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodero </PERSON> 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> when she was stricken. She was taken to a first-aid station at the club, then to a <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> hospital, where she was pronounced dead of an apparent heart attack, said hospital director <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunge </PERSON>. Federal Judge <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Piotti </PERSON> was quoted as telling <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> y Noticias that he issued the order Sunday night prohibiting the departure of the body from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Piotti </PERSON> said the transportation of the body from the country club to the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> hospital involved `` errors of procedure, perhaps involuntary'' by medical personnel, the news agency said. No further details were immediately available. The body was at the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, where a private funeral Mass was held Sunday.

<HEAD>Brazilian Oil Workers End Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of oil workers today began returning to work after a 10-day nationwide walkout, the state oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> and strike leaders said. Local unions voted Sunday night to accept a government offer of wage increases, <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> press officer <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> of the national strike command in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, said some unions still were voting on the proposal, but `` the tendency is to accept the offer.'' `` It was a great political victory, although economically it did n't attain what we wanted,'' he said in a telephone interview. The strike by more than 50,000 petroleum workers paralyzed the nation's 11 refineries and caused severe shortages of cooking gas and diesel fuel. In weekend emergency meetings, the government offered strikers a 15 percent cost-of-living raise retroactive to June 1987 and 4 percent more for productivity. <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to punish strikers and to discount only four days from their paychecks. Strike leaders urged unions to accept the offer, although it fell short of the 26.6 percent increase they were demanding. The government suspended cost-of-living raises last year, saying they fuel inflation now running at more than 1,000 percent a year. Oil workers earn an average $ 300 a month _ good wages by Brazilian standards. The strike forced the government to import emergency shipments of diesel fuel, cooking gas and kerosene. Gas rationing was imposed in some parts of the country. Brazilian refineries can produce 1.5 million barrels of petroleum by-products a day. The country consumes about 1.1 million barrels of oil daily, of which nearly 50 percent is imported.

<TEXT>
 An American hostage in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking fought back tears today while testifying he feared his son-in-law would be shot during the ordeal. Also at the trial, a defense attorney said confessed hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was `` mentally disturbed'' during the crime and asked that his client be given a psychiatric examination. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is accused of air piracy and murder in the June 1985 hijacking. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Vincente </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, a real estate developer, testified that his son-in-law, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON>, was among several hostages taken off the plane at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and then hidden in the city before the ordeal was over. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 57, said he offered to take <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON>'s place. `` I thought he could be ... shot, and I asked <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> ` do n't take him away, take me.' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> just pushed me back and told me to sit down,'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> testified, choking back his emotions and seeming on the verge of crying. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also took part in robbing passengers. Earlier today, defense attorney <PERSON> Hans-Burkhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> asked that a psychiatrist examine <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. He said he has evidence from a psychiatrist that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had been `` hindered in his development'' because of injuries he sustained in war-torn <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Another American testified that she feared the hijackers would deal with her severely because she was Jewish. `` I was very afraid because I am Jewish and I did n't know if they knew it,'' <PERSON> Mauri </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, a 36-year-old computer saleswoman, told the court. `` I heard screams and beatings on more than one occasion.'' Ms. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said one of the passengers sitting near her had asked for medical help because he had a heart condition `` but the hijackers refused.'' Following Ms. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>' testimony, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was asked to comment. `` I never took part in the robberies and if anyone had asked me for a doctor, I would have done that,'' he said. Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, former hostages do not reveal their hometowns. They have testified about savage beatings and the death of <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, who was shot and thrown out onto the tarmac in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admits being one of the hijackers, but denies shooting <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. He was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in January 1987 after custom officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> requested <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s extradition last year, but the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government turned it down, fearing for the lives of two West Germans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostages since have been released. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, is serving a 13-year prison term in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in connection with the kidnappings.

<TEXT>
 Populist leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> met with the leader of an ethnic Indian immigrant party today to try to forge an alliance that would make her the first woman prime minister of an Islamic country. The <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, captured the largest bloc of votes in Wednesday's national election but fell short of a majority in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who has said she expects to be the country's new prime minister, is seeking the support of elected independent and smaller parties to form a governing majority. She met today with <PERSON> Altaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Mohajir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which came in third in the election and represents ethnic Indian Moslem immigrants. <PERSON> Wasim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajjad </PERSON>, minister for justice and parliamentary affairs, announced today that President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> intends to persuade Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and her conservative rival <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> to unite in a coalition government. <PERSON> Sajjad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> will meet separately with the two leaders Tuesday. A government spokesman, who requested anonymity, said `` the discussion with the two major party leaders will be to form a broad-based government. It's only natural.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said she will not accept a coalition with <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> was second in the election, officials said. Last week's vote, the first free elections in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> since 1977, had no majority winner. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party won 93 seats in the 237-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, compared to 55 for the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>. The remaining 68 seats contested went to independents, minor parties and non-Moslem candidates. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, 35, says she has enough recruits among newly elected members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to command a majority in the chamber, and expects the president to ask her party to form the new government. In voting for provincial assembly seats on Saturday, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party was only able to obtain an outright majority in one of the country's four provinces She virtually swept her home province of <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. But in the heavily populated <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> province, where 60 percent of the country's 107 million people live, the majority went to the right-wing alliance. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and the four provincial assemblies elect the president, who is head of state. The president, in turn, has the power to name the prime minister. However, the Constitution has two clauses on naming a prime minister. One gives the president discretion both in timing and selection of a prime minister. The other, originally meant to apply to elections held after 1990, requires the new legislature to convene first and the person with the majority of votes to head the government. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> maintains that the 1990 provision applies to the current situation. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, had added the 1990 provision to the Constitution after deciding he would continue as president with the powers to decide prime minister until 1990. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in a plane crash Aug. 17, just weeks after calling national elections. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in a bloodless 1977 coup and had <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> executed two years later.

<TEXT>
 An inmate convicted of two murders and sentenced to two life terms escaped from a 153-year-old section of the <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> state prison early this morning after burrowing out of his cell and using a handmade ladder to scale an outer wall, officials said. <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>, who would have to serve at least 60 years before being considered for parole, was spotted scaling the 20-foot outer wall of the prison at 4 a.m. today by a tower guard, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>, 37, jumped over the wall after the guard called out at him. Two other inmates who had also escaped from the cell _ <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBrada </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisesi </PERSON>, both 28 _ did not try to escape after they heard the guard, he said. The three were cellmates in the prison's oldest section, which opened in 1835, and burrowed through a 3-foot-thick wall to escape. They squeezed through a narrow opening into the prison compound, and then <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> used a 19-foot ladder fashioned from wood scraps to scale the outer wall, <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> apparently cut himself on razor wire on the top of the outer wall because blood was found on the ladder and outside the wall, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON> said it was not immediately known how the three cut through their cell wall or where they found the wood to build the ladder. He said <PERSON> LaBrada </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bisesi </PERSON> were being questioned this morning. Corrections officials and local authorities were conducting a wide search of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> this morning. Tracking dogs following a partial trail of blood believed left by <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> led authorities to a drainage system along Route 29, and authorities believed <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> was in the area, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, head of special operations groups for the corrections department. Helicopters traveled up and down the river as authorities opened manholes and rifle-toting officers stood guard at streets closed off in the area, a densely populated blue-collar neighborhood of rowhouses. <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>, sent to the prison in 1986, also was convicted of robbery, sexual assault and burglary.

<HEAD>Task Force Gives University Until Dec. 5 To Revise Smoking Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State legislators are asking <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> officials to reconsider banning smoking in some parts of the campus, and are threatening to cut the school's budget if they do n't. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, meeting Sunday, gave the state university until Dec. 5 to change its proposed campus smoking policy. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> is the nation's leading tobacco grower. If the university does n't back down, `` It'll open up the awfullest can of worms,'' said the Rep. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Crupper </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Crupper </PERSON> said the legislature has the ultimate weapon: the budget. The proposed policy _ disclosed last week and scheduled to take effect by the new year _ would prohibit smoking in common areas such as stairwells, hallways and reception areas. Cafeterias would be divided into smoking and non-smoking areas. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a university administrator, told the legislators that the university is willing to `` rethink this provision and maybe have something more balanced.'' `` I'll take back to campus tomorrow what you've said,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` I hear you loud and clear.'' He also said, `` The policy is not meant to be anti-tobacco or anti-smoking but to better balance the rights of smokers and non-smokers on our campus.'' If the university does n't back down, other committees _ including those dealing with agriculture, small businesses, and labor and industry _ will take up the cause, <PERSON> Crupper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crupper </PERSON> initially called on the task force to approve a resolution asking the university to back down. But he later agreed to give the university until the task force's Dec. 5 meeting to revise its policy. The provision of the policy that most offended legislators Sunday night was a clause that resolves otherwise irreconcilable conflicts between smokers and non-smokers in favor of the non-smoker. <PERSON> Crupper </PERSON> said that if a restrictive policy is enacted at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION>, it would spread to other state universities. Sen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said, `` I'm concerned with the precedent it would set and the impression it would give people.'' The state's total income from tobacco production in 1984 was $ 2.3 billion, and that led to $ 126 million in taxes, according to task-force Chairman Rep. <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gedling </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A radio news director who walked off the job after being subjected to on-air sexual jokes by two disc jockeys has won $ 8,000 in severance pay. Arbitrator <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Talarico </PERSON> said various sex-related jokes made on WBZZ-FM about newscaster <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> `` were lewd, offensive, sophomoric, in bad taste and beyond anything that an employee should have to be subjected to _ even if they are part of an ` entertainment vehicle.''' Ms. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> walked off the Jan. 22 morning show of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> and `` Banana'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> after a joke of a sexual nature was aired about her. The station fired her and refused to give her severance pay, saying her walk-off constituted a `` flagrant neglect of duty'' in violation of <ORGANIZATION> WBZZ </ORGANIZATION>'s collective bargaining agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION>. In voluntary arbitration between the federation and <ORGANIZATION> WBZZ </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION> EZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Talarico </PERSON> said the station could not deny Ms. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> the severance pay. The written opinion was received by Ms. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>'s attorney last week. <PERSON> Talarico </PERSON> ordered the station to pay her 10 weeks' salary, plus interest. Station Manager <PERSON> Tex </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> estimated the award at $ 8,000. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said the station planned to appeal. <PERSON> Talarico </PERSON> agreed with WBZZ that Ms. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> knew her job would require her to be involved in `` banter and interplay'' with other on-air employees, some of which might be risque. But, he wrote, Ms. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>'s participation in earlier jokes did not prevent her from objecting to the `` vile and filthy'' Jan. 22 joke. `` Obviously, we're pleased with the decision,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>'s attorney. But <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said he was surprised by the decision, because `` the arbitrator determined <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> willingly participated in humorous banter.'' A civil suit filed by Ms. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> against the station, <ORGANIZATION> EZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> and former program director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> is pending.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 12th parliament today opened on a fractious note as 15 leftist legislators refused to be sworn in by a lawmaker whose party calls for expelling Arabs from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprintzak </PERSON>, 77, of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Moledet </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Homeland -RRB- party, administered the oaths under a law that makes the oldest member of the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, its acting speaker until a permanent speaker is chosen. A new speaker was chosen after the swearing-in ceremony. He is <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. Moledet, which won two seats in the Nov. 1 elections, calls for the `` voluntary transfer'' of Palestinians from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied territories. Before swearing in the new legislators, <PERSON> Sprintzak </PERSON> delivered a highly political speech in which he called for a Greater <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a concept under which the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would become part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. More than a dozen left-wing legislators, shouting words of protest, got up from their seats and walked to the back of the hall. They returned when <PERSON> Sprintzak </PERSON> called the names of each <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> member, but then 15 members refused to take the required oath. `` We will not be sworn in by a transferist who represents for us the complete opposite of law, morality and justice, Jewish and human, for which we were elected,'' said <PERSON> Ran </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. Five members of his faction were among those refusing to be sworn in by <PERSON> Sprintzak </PERSON>. Others included <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Burg </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. New parliament members can not participate in proceedings until they take the oath, said parliament spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Yitzhaki </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Moledet </ORGANIZATION>'s platform calls for bringing about the `` voluntary transfer'' of 1.5 million Palestinians from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> through government policies that would deny Arabs employment and other services. <PERSON> Sprintzak </PERSON> has been quoting as saying he is not a racist and advocates the transfer as the most humane solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The election of <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> as new parliament speaker was also controversial. <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> has said he will refuse to meet with a <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> delegation if elected. `` I, <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON>, am a Holocaust survivor and I have to be loyal to my brothers ... I will not shake a German's hand. Even if I wanted to I could not do it,'' he said. The 64-year-old Lithuanian-born <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> was sentenced to 21 months in jail in 1952 for carrying explosives during a demonstration against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s reparation talks with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He was released after 16 months in jail.

<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> called for an investigation into the deaths of three farm workers killed during last week's meeting of the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said Sunday that in addition to the three deaths in the eastern province of <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION>, 20 people were killed in combat during the conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The prelate gave no details of the civilian slayings, which had not been reported previously. `` The information available involved national army troops in this action and we consider a detailed investigation necessary,'' the archbishop said in his homily. `` We believe acts of this type make the public react negatively against whomever uses that method, whether it be the armed forces or -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB-,'' he said. The five leftist guerrilla groups, which have been fighting for nine years to overthrow the U.S.-backed government, declared a temporary truce during the six-day <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> meeting that ended Saturday. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said the meeting of the Washington-based organization left `` an atmosphere of hope'' for peace. It `` has meant, in a way, a certain possibility of support in that it could stimulate a political solution to our conflict,'' the church leader said. More than 15,000 people from churches and labor organizations marched through the main streets of the capital on Nov. 15 to urge rebel and government representatives to hold new peace talks. `` This is reason for joy for those of us who believe in the possibility of promoting peace through non-violent actions,'' he said. The church mediated the few meetings between the two sides in recent years, the latest on Oct. 20, 1987 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and has been critical of killings of civilians by both the left and the right. An estimated 65,000 people have died in the war, the majority of them civilians.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced today he will retain Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> chief has `` a record of unquestioned integrity and a commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards.'' At a news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he is appointing <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> because `` I know that he will work with me to fight drugs with every tool at our disposal'' and on other issues as well, including attacking crime `` at every level'' and defending the civil rights of all Americans. Since election day Nov. 8, a number of other names had emanated from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp as possible replacements for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. In a brief interview at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that he had learned of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to retain him at a weekend meeting initiated by the president-elect and that `` I was extremely pleased and gratified that he made this appointment.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision `` gives me the opportunity to continue what I hope will be a positive and productive course for the department,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in the interview. `` My priorities will be the president-elect's priorities.'' In addition to fighting drugs, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said `` our efforts in ... white-collar crime, official corruption should be important to ensure high ethical standards in government and our business institutions.'' He singled out the environment and civil rights as other areas warranting attention. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 56, has been in the Cabinet only since Aug. 12, when he succeeded <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who resigned at the conclusion of a 14-month criminal investigation of his affairs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declared he had been vindicated. But the independent counsel who conducted the probe, while deciding not to seek an indictment, said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably had twice broken a federal conflict-of-interest law and violated tax laws. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked the day after he was elected president if he would keep on <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and several other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet members considered to be `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> people,'' did not answer directly. He said that `` some people at various levels may be asked to remain,'' but that `` there is something to be said for reinvigorating the process by, with new people.'' Indeed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insiders had sent mixed signals about the future of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who was said to be eager to keep his job. At one point, those insiders had gone out of their way to discourage reports that his reappointment was assured. Other names that had been tossed about as possible replacements for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> were <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON>, a former deputy at Justice and former <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> administrator, and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. In taking over the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, a former governor of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, had vowed to `` make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> headed the department's criminal division during the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration and established the agency's public integrity section, which prosecutes corrupt public officials.

 The National Guard patrolled in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, while the South cleaned up today from a barrage of nearly two dozen late-season tornadoes and storms that killed at least two people and damaged more than 150 homes. The same storm system carried high wind and heavy rain to parts of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on Sunday, ripping off the roof of an empty school in southwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and toppling a 75-foot Christmas tree in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. It later became the first big snowstorm of the season to hit <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, dumping sleet and nearly a foot of snow that was blamed for more than 100 traffic accidents, with two fatalities. Caribou recorded 10 inches of snow. In the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, Tropical Storm Keith churned off <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> after becoming the 11th tropical storm of the season Forecasters expect it to reach hurricane strength as it heads into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It could hit <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> late in the week. Twisters skipped across <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missisippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, uprooting trees, damaging homes and downing power lines this weekend. The tornadoes struck unusally late in the year, said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Severe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. One tornado slammed through a three-mile area near the small northeast <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nettleton </LOCATION>, snapping the tops off trees before dipping into a mobile home park and running along a string of hills and valleys. Two people in mobile homes _ a 37-year-old man and the 9-month-old boy _ were found dead Sunday after the tornado hit. Nine others were injured, including one hospitalized in critical and one in serious condition. Ten houses and two businesses were destroyed and 24 homes were damaged, officials said. `` It's terrible,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who toured the area Sunday. `` There's nothing that was left standing much in the path of the storm.'' Tornadoes also were reported in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> counties of <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bolivar </ORGANIZATION>, Sunflower and <PERSON> Leake </PERSON>, with at least 25 houses damaged in <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>. Three traffic deaths in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> were blamed on wet weather. The weather is believed to have contributed to six traffic deaths in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> since Friday. Six people were killed Friday night when a small plane slammed into a mountain in <LOCATION> Batesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, while trying to land in dense fog and thunderstorms. The cause of the crash has not been determined. The twin-engine plane slammed into a mountain during its second attempt to land in dense fog and thunderstorms Friday night. A tornado in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, early Sunday cut a mile-long path of destruction, damaging homes and knocking out electrical service to 3,600 homes. Nearly 100 homes were damaged or destroyed and six people were injured. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said he was on his way into the kitchen when the tornado slammed into his two-story home. `` That's when the kitchen came apart,'' <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said Sunday afternoon. `` The ceiling just vanished. So did much of our house.'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tuscaloosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, surveyed the damage by helicopter. `` We're looking at 15 houses totally destroyed, 20 to 25 with major-to-moderate damage and another 50 to 60 with shingles off or gutters off or this type of thing,'' he said. Buck Medley of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said most people forced from their homes stayed with friends or relatives. `` We were going to open shelters, but it was n't necessary,'' he said. Tuscaloosa Mayor <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> DuPont </PERSON> said National Guardsmen helped with the cleanup Sunday and guarded against looting Sunday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> also set up a disaster center to help those whose homes were damaged. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, classes were canceled for today at the German <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> McClellandtown </LOCATION> after a fierce thunderstorm tore off the roof of the building Sunday. Forty miles to the north in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, a 75-feet-tall Christmas tree was knocked over by high winds. The artificial tree, boasting 5,812 lights, was erected by <ORGANIZATION> Duquesne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at Point State Park. `` The wind is blowing so hard you ca n't tell how hard it's raining, but the rain is going sideways,'' said <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucot </PERSON>, who works at a supermarket in <LOCATION> Aliquippa </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Heavy rains in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Sunday left four rivers swollen to near flood stage _ the Millstone, <LOCATION> Raritan </LOCATION>, Saddle and <LOCATION> Ramapo </LOCATION> rivers in the northwestern and northern parts of the state. Rain, wind and lightning also forced a halt in departures for a time Sunday evening at the three major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area airports, <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, spokesman for the government agency that runs them. Weekend deluges in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> also spawned flood warnings for several rivers, including the <LOCATION> Ouachita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkadelphia </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>.

 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> nudged past <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and buffeted <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> with its 65 mph winds early today on a curving track that forecasters expected would hit <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> later in the week. The late-season <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> depression grew into the 11th tropical storm of the season off <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Sunday morning, and forecasters expected it to reach hurricane strength as it headed into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. At 11 a.m. EST, the storm was located about 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, near latitude 22.5 north, longitude 87 west. Forecasters say they expect it to continue to move north at 12 mph. <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, a popular resort city, was buffeted by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> two months ago. `` Heavy showers and thunderstorms continue over western <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and may affect the lower Keys and southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> later today and tonight,'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. But `` the center of <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> is expected to remain over the <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the next day or two.'' The goverment of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch for the northern <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, and storm conditions were expected to spread over western <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> today. Rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches were possible along the path of the storm, forecasters said. People living in low-lying areas of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> were evacuated Sunday afternoon, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Excelsior news service said. It was unknown how many left their homes for public shelters. However, many homes badly damaged by <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> in September remained unoccupied. Excelsior said flood waters were 3-feet deep in some areas. For much of Sunday, forecasters worried that <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> could race to southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with hurricane-force winds of 75 to 80 mph by Tuesday morning, but <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> lingered off <LOCATION> Cozumel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, as its steering currents weakened. `` It's going to head in this general direction as it turns north or northeast,'' hurricane center meteorologist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said late Sunday. `` But in 72 hours, we'd still have it in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, somewhere west of Key West.'' The Coral Gables forecasting center predicted the highest probability, a 1-in-7 chance, of the storm hitting the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION> by 7 p.m. Wednesday. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> then was expected to cross the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> peninsula and head into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. `` It should be at minimal hurricane strength when it hits <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lushine </PERSON> of the National Hurrican Center. `` Anywhere from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> area looks like that's the major area of concern. Tropical depressions become tropical storms once their top sustained winds reach 39 mph, and tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph. The system passed south of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> as a depression late Friday and early Saturday, drenching <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> with nearly 4 inches of rain in 24 hours. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30, with storm activity usually peaking in mid-September. The season has spawned two major hurricanes _ <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which devestated <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, which killed scores of people in northern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Cautions Against Buying Dangerous Toys</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A consumer group, advising Americans to be on the lookout for potential hazards as they shop for childrens' Christmas gifts, today cited baby walkers and crib gyms as products that cause particular concern The <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> said in its annual toy quality and safety report that baby walkers, which can tip over or topple down stairs, are `` highly dangerous'' and led to 20,790 child injury reports to the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 1987. Crib gyms have caused 674 reported injuries since 1984 and 12 deaths, the committee said. While most manufacturers now include voluntary warning labels that recommend removal of the gym toys when a baby can pull itself up to its hands and knees, many carry no such warning, it said. `` Warnings are n't enough,'' the committee said. `` Crib gyms need to be designed in the first place without hazards. Babies begin to enjoy crib gyms just at the age that parents are advised to remove them. So human nature enters the picture and parents leave the crib gyms a little longer.'' Overall, the committee said, toys resulted in 131,000 injuries in 1987, 105,000 of them to children under age 15. The committee said categories of potentially dangerous toys include: _ Some seasonal toys such as inflatable sleds that throw up snow which could blind the driver _ Flammable items, including stuffed animals that burn _ Toys that teach children to imitate adults in a dangerous fashion, such as an electric oven that could burn a child and a play iron with a realistic-looking plug that could send children to the nearest electrical socket _ Toys that can be dangerous when broken For example, a medical kit of poor construction that contains instruments which could break while a child puts them up to his face, throat, ears or eyes. _ Items that are dangerous for babies, including rattles that do n't meet specified width requirements which a baby could poke down its throat and choke on _ Toys with inadequate or misleading age labels In some cases, manufacturers may label a product containing small parts as `` for ages over 3,'' but the product nevertheless would be appealing to younger children. The committee laid much of the blame for the abundance of dangerous toys on what it called the `` pitiful ineptitude'' of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. It said the commission took just one major toy-related action this year, in banning lawn darts. `` Toy manufacturers, aware they can virtually ignore the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>, understand there's no one watching the store,'' the committee said. `` Manufacturers seldom market dangerous toys willfully, but bottom line considerations can obscure safety issues.'' <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrrell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> said it had not yet seen the report and thus would have no immediate comment on the criticisms of the agency. She noted that the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> will soon issue its own report on safe and unsafe Christmas toys. The committee also said the toy industry experienced a shakeout in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash that did not bode well for consumers. `` The response of some toy manufacturers has been to fight a holding action, suspending creative development and sticking with tried and true, cheaper production methods, and increased reliance on offshore production,'' it said. The committee offered several tips to use when shopping for safe, fun and affordable toys, including: _ Safety Watch out for sharp edges, small parts, projectiles and potential danger if toy breaks. Toys that include fabric should say flame retardant-flame resistant; painted toys should be non-toxic. _ Buy the toy, not the box Examine the contents to make sure they are the same as what's pictured outside. _ Consider play value Will the item offer enjoyment for a long time or lose its appeal after 15 minutes? _ Battery requirements Take into account the added expense. _ Save sales receipts Some stores will match the price of their competition. _ Save toy directions Always read them, avoid toys with overcomplicated ones. _ Potential mess Consider how messy or destructive a toy will be. _ Check newspaper ads Popular toys may go on sale just before Christmas and be more readily available late in the season. _ Consider child's age Good toys should not require constant supervision to ensure safety or correct use. _ Avoid `` hot'' items They may be cheaper next year, and ads may be overglamorizing them.

 About 4,000 ethnic Albanians today defied threats of a crackdown on street demonstrations and marched to the capital of the restive province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> television said. Leaders of the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> renewed their campaign for more control of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province following a wave of protests. In the liberal northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, meanwhile, an estimated 10,000 people held a peaceful rally in driving snow to demand a referendum on controversial constitutional amendments. <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> television said today's crowds marched from <LOCATION> Orohovac </LOCATION>, 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, to demand reinstatement of two ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> leaders who were forced to resign under Serbian pressure last week. Police outside <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> shepherded the crowd as it passed through the predominatly Serb suburb of <ORGANIZATION> Kosovo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polje </ORGANIZATION>, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. No clashes between the rival groups were reported. The demonstrations in the southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, involving up to 100,000 people last weekend, have been the biggest there since World War II. The protesters have been angered by the forced resignations last Thursday of <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kacusa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON>, two ethnic Albanians from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 13-member ruling Politburo. The provincial party leadership has promised to review the resignations of <LOCATION> Vlasi </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON> at a meeting later this week. Asked why the the protesters had decided to defy warnings from numerous Communist party leaders against more protests, student <PERSON> Skelzen </PERSON> <PERSON> Malici </PERSON> said, `` We are aware of this, but we intend to continue coming here until the -LRB- two leaders -RRB- are reinstated.'' Serbian Communist leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who has led the campaign for more Serbian control of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, appeared to reject protesters' demands that the two ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> leaders be reinstated. In a speech to Serbian Communist leaders in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> made no direct reference to the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> protests, but said ethnic Albanian youths, who made up the majority of the protesters, are `` victims of indoctrination.'' `` The ideologues of counterrevolution should be held responsible and not those who are just their arm,'' he addded. He said that restoring Serbian control over the judiciary, schools and policing of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> to stop alleged harassment of the Slav minority are `` a precondition for <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> unity.'' <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> said in his speech today that about 500 ethnic Albanians who have been jailed on charges of fomenting counterrevolution with alleged nationalism should be freed. `` We should let these people out of jail and jail those who are really responsible for the genocide and terror,'' he said. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and his supporters commonly use terms such as `` genocide and terror'' when talking about the alleged harassment of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Serb </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montenegrin </LOCATION> minorities by ethnic Albanians. Official statistics show little if any evidence of ethnically motivated murder or proof of frequently alleged rapes of <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> women by ethnic Albanian men. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s is campaigning for changes in the 1974 constitution that gave <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> broad autonomy. Communist leaders in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s other five republics see the campaign as part of a drive to increase the influence of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest republic, on the Yugoslav federation. But <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> has said the changes would only put <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> on an equal footing with other republics, which have no administrative provinces like <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced today he will retain Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, bringing to three the number of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> holdovers in his Cabinet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he would nominate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide and deputy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, to head the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. The president-elect said that `` in all likelihood'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and previously announced <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would be the only current Cabinet members he would ask to remain in their posts. All were recent appointments to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet and took office with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s blessing In response to questions from reporters after his announcement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that dismissed his `` flexible freeze'' proposal for cutting the budget deficit. It said that tax increases as well as military and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> cuts would have to be considered. `` I'm not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit down,'' he said, though he also said he was `` open-minded'' and prepared to hear a range of recommendations. `` I do n't remember any Republicans or Democrats running on a please-raise-my-taxes program,'' he said. `` I do n't remember that.'' On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it would be premature for him to consider any specific proposals that might be put forth next month when Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> comes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and meets with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It will be President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'll be there as vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I expect they'll be aware they're talking to the next president.'' He said that `` in terms of specificity, in terms of my committing a brand new administration to specifics in arms control or anything else, I'm not going to do that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphasized the role that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> would have in fighting drugs. `` Drugs are public enemy No. 1,'' said the president-elect. He went on to say that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` will work with me to fight drugs with every tool at our disposal.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, a former president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is the first Hispanic to hold a Cabinet post but he added, `` Overriding is Dr. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' commitment to excellence in education.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised Hispanic leaders that he would name a Hispanic to his Cabinet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his choice of <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> underscores his determination to cut the budget deficit. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> understands the numbers,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> will play a central role in that effort, which will commence immediately when I assume office. Because he understands the government and the economy so well, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> will make sure the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hits the ground running.'' The president-elect denied he planned to meet Thanksgiving weekend with his defeated Democratic opponent, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did want to meet `` at some point'' with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I want to do it, I do n't want to have a lot of show business,'' he said. `` I want to hold out my hand and say, ` the campaign is behind us.''' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> was named to succeed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> in September. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor, is a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ally who took office last August. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> will be the second and third members of the current <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to remain on the job. Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> would keep his position. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also appointed former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as his secretary of state. After his announcements today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with former Presidents Ford and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to hear the recommendations from a commission they headed concerning the new administration. As they arrived, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> exclaimed to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` You look so well rested!'' `` The fishing was good. No fish,'' replied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who spent several days in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after the election. `` It looks like you have n't done anything all fall,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. The nation's only other living ex-president, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, was meeting nearby with Vice president-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked by reporters what happened to the rumored appointment of <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>, replied, `` Nothing happened. Just do n't believe all the leaks you read in the newspapers. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, co-director of the transition, said, `` We have a high regard for him. We're still working on the chairman's appointment. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> is a conservative economist and expert on the Social Security system. He was a father of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` flexible freeze'' idea to drive down the deficit. The stock market has sagged and the value of the dollar has fallen since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> captured the White House on Nov. 8. Many analysts fear that his no-tax-hike pledge will impede efforts to bring down the deficit, now growing by $ 155 billion a year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he takes the deficit seriously and will work with Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to forge a solution, but he has shown no willingness to budge on the issue of taxes. Democrats, meanwhile, have said they wo n't take the political heat or a tax increase by themselves. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent a quiet weekend out of the limelight, attending church Sunday, jogging and conferring at home with Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, his chosen chief of staff. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> revealed last Tuesday that he is keeping his friend <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as treasury secretary. He told reporters Friday he was concentrating on naming the rest of his economic team before turning his attention to defense and national security posts.

 The judge in the Iran-Contra case said today the major charges against former presidential aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants boiled down to simple allegations of fraud. `` I am not trying anything else; it's a fraud trial,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told one of North's lawyers, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON>, during a hearing on defense motions to dismiss the central conspiracy charge in the case. `` It is fraud in the sense that Chief Justice -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> thereafter have consistently applied'' to the conspiracy statute, the judge said. The defense, supported Friday by a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> brief, contends <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his three co-defendants could not be prosecuted for obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign affairs authority by running a secret arms-supply network to the Nicarguan rebels. The 1924 decision written by <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> held that defendants did not have to violate a particular law in order to be guilty of obstructing government or depriving it of honest service. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also expressed puzzlement over defense contentions that the diversion of arms-sale profits to the rebels, known as Contras, did not violate the so-called Boland Amendent restrictions on military aid. `` I am having a difficult time understanding why it is necessary to decide what the Boland Amendment means,'' the judge said. The defense contends that the series of amendments enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban direct military aid by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies did not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> North </PERSON> was an aide until his dismissal two years ago. `` The indictment clearly depends upon the application of the Boland Amendment to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, arguing that if it did then it was unconstitutional. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> expressed concern over allegations that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and others falsely assured <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they were complying with the series of Boland Amendments. `` Is it your position that the executive branch can represent through its people that they are complying with a statute and at the same time be affirmatively, knowingly disobeying it because the statute is unconstitutional?'' `` That is not the position I am taking,'' <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said. `` Are you saying the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> affirmatively intended to skim off the profits of the ` enterprise' and use them to buy arms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>?'' the judge asked later. When <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> demurred again, the judge said the defense argument `` seems like <PERSON> Jello </PERSON>. It does n't have anything I can pick up with my hands.'' North's appearance today in court was his first since <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the former presidential aide was cynically trying to place himself above law. In a written opinion, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> harshly criticized <PERSON> North </PERSON> for arguing that he could n't be prosecuted for lying to then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> or destroying documents during the 1986 presidential investigation of the Iran-Contra affair. That opinion rejected an earlier attempt by <PERSON> North </PERSON> to have charges against him dismissed. The judge said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` fails to appreciate the gravity of his alleged conduct.'' He added that the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel's argument `` reveals a skewed attitude toward our constitutional form of government.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> already has rejected a number of defense motions to dismiss some of the 15 charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who is the irst of the four Iran-Contra defendants set to be tried. No date has been set for the trial. North is accused of conspiring with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, arms dealer <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to divert illegally U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Still pending are defense motions attacking the central conspiracy counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his co-defendants, including arguments that the <ORGANIZATION> Boland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> _ which banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras at the time _ did not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. North also contends that the diversion of arms-sale profits was n't illegal because the weapons were no longer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government property when they were sold to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The defense argues that <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> owned the weapons after purchasing them as middlemen in the arms-for-hostage deals. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lent support to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense on Friday, by challenging <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s contention that the defendants can be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of its ability to oversee foreign affairs. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contends the clandestine arms-supply network to the Nicaraguan rebels stymied congressional oversight of foreign policy and enforcement of the Boland Amendment. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the president, not <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has the power to enforce laws. It argued in a friend-of-the-court brief that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> ascribed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a too-powerful role in foreign affairs. `` Because of the doctrine of executive privilege and the president's inherent foreign affairs authority, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' authority to compel disclosure of information concerning covert activity is necessarily subject to formidable constitutional limitations.'' Nor can <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` prohibit the president and his subordinates from exercising the president's authority to engage in diplomacy or to exercise covert influence in the realm of external affairs,'' the department said. Assistant Attorneys General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, of the criminal division, and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kmiec </PERSON>, head of the office of legal counsel, said the department was not arguing for or against dismissal of the central conspiracy count. But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> conceded that adoption of the department's arguments might `` narrow the scope'' of the charge.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Lithuanians chanting `` for shame!'' jammed the center of their capital <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> today to protest their legislature's refusal to declare the Sovutonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, residents said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, lawmakers recommended changes in constitutional amendments that have touched off the furor in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the other Baltic republics, iet republic's aEstonia and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, because of limits they place on the republics' powers, the daily Pravda said. The amendments were proposed by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as the keystone of his political reform program, which includes the creation of a more powerful presidency and a full-time national legislature. In <LOCATION> Vilnuis </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perestroika </ORGANIZATION>'s call for a 10-minute noon protest halted traffic in the city center, and about 10,000 people rallied on the city's <LOCATION> Gediminas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, said movement spokeswoman <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dapkus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alvydas </PERSON> <PERSON> Medalinskas </PERSON>, the movement's acting secretary, addressed the crowd from a balcony and called for the removal of three members of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Central Coithuanian words meaning `` for shame, for shame,'' to criticize the inaction of their republic's lawmakers, Ms. <PERSON> Dapkus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Medalinskas </PERSON> told the crowd that what happened on Friday `` was detrimental not only to the -LRB- Lithuanian Perestroika -RRB- movement, but to all of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>,'' she said. The grassroots movement has called for another meeting of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s Supreme Soviet by Nov. 29, and is collecting signatures on petitions that call for such a session. What Ms. <PERSON> Dapkus </PERSON> called a `` symbolic strike'' was to last for 10 minutes throughout <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. She said traffic had come to a standstill in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, but there was no word yet from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s other cities Police in central <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> took no steps to interfere with the rally on Gediminas Square, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Dapkus </PERSON>, who is from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said she will be leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this week to set up an information bureau for the Lithuanian movement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Pravda said today that a commission of the Supreme Soviet had recommended modifications in amendments to the Constitution that were proposed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the national leadership as an apparent attempt to placate the Baltic republics. As originally written, the amendment to Article 108 authorizes a newly created <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to `` take decisions relative to the composition of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, the approval of the formation of new autonomous republics and autonomous regions in the composition of the union republics.'' The commission recommended that article be changed to limit the council to questions `` of national-state structure relative to the jurisdiction of the U.S.S.R.'' Article 108 also authorized the council to annul legislation and acts of the Soviet republics if they contradict the Constitution. The commission, which met Saturday, recommended that such language be stricken as part of an effort to increase `` the development of the sovereign rights of the republics,'' Pravda said. However, the lawmakers also condemned the action of the Estonian Supreme Soviet, saying its decision on Wednesday to give local laws primacy over Soviet legislation was at odds with the 1977 Soviet Constitution. Their ruling was transmitted to the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's highest executive body, possibly presaging a striking down of the Estonian decision by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the third <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, were independent after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution until 1940, when they were annexed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The small Westward-looking republics have used President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms _ dubbed `` perestroika'' _ to push for greater economic and cultural autonomy. Baltic residents contend that proposed amendments to the Soviet Constitution will limit their autonomy.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> must hold a mayoral election next year to fill the two years remaining of the term of the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today. The high court ruled without dissent. It said that a reading of state election law, along with the state law governing municipalities, requires that a special election be held to fill a vacancy that occurs with more than 28 months left on a four-year term. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the city's first black mayor, died of a heart attack Nov. 25, 1987, with 3 -LCB- years left of his second term. `` The scheme recognizes the importance of the voters not to have a mayoral appointee who is not of their own choosing for more than 28 months,'' Justice <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> wrote in the court's opinion. A lower court ruling already has called for a primary Feb. 28, followed by a general election April 4. The decision was eagerly awaited by a crowded field of announced and unannounced mayoral candidates. Unannounced candidates include the incumbent acting mayor, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, and front runner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who were both said to be awaiting the ruling before announcing. Neither had any immediate comment after the ruling was handed down today. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the late mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> who died in 1976, just won a landslide re-election as <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney and was the leader in a recent poll of potential mayoral contenders. `` That's no surprise. ... I never had any doubt that it would be 1989,'' said Democratic Alderman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who has already announced his candidacy. `` We of course would have preferred that the question would have been cleared up a lot earlier.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who is black, was appointed acting mayor a year ago by a bitterly divided <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> after receiving the support of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s white council opponents. He has trailed in the mayoral polls to another black Democrat, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who has claimed to be <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s true political heir. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, a strongly Democratic town where no Republican has been mayor for more than a half-century, the primary is considered decisive. Many observers have said that if <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> split the black vote in the February primary, and other white candidates step aside, it could pave the way for a victory by <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. The city's population is 40 percent black <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 54, had supported the 1991 date, but has said repeatedly he is prepared to run a campaign immediately. Though <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, 46, has declined to say whether he will run, close associates have been quoted as saying they expect him to make a bid. There are three other white candidates who have already announced, but two of them are considered likely to pull out if <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> runs. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> lost to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a three-way <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary in 1983, when he and incumbent Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> split the white vote. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> today called the ruling `` a great victory'' for the people of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Candidate <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, the white liberal alderman who was a staunch <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ally, agreed. `` I think it's the decision the public wanted. They did n't want 29 members of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to elect their mayor for three years,'' said <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>. He is not considered to be much of a factor in the race but insists he's in it to the end.

 Upbeat Republican governors opened a conference today with top appointees to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new administration on hand and newly renamed Cabinet members on the way. `` The transition happening in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is actually happening right here,'' said <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>, chairman of the conference. Twenty of the nation's 23 Republican governors, along with two governors-elect, were on hand for opening ceremonies, with all holding hand on heart for the Pledge of Allegiance and national anthem. The formal opening occurred after President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would retain Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> in their Cabinet posts in the new Republican adinistration. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> both were on the governors conference program today, along with Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently named as his new chief of staff, and former <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recommended to be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The president-elect is to meet with the governors Tuesday. <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> said the lineup of influential <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff members and the president-elect put the conference `` as much in the forefront of changing events'' as any such meeting could be. `` I think this administration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is going to be even more sensitive to the states,'' said <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>. Castle and <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> commented Sunday aboard the U.S.S. <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, an aircraft carrier docked off <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Nine of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governors put on flight helmets and flew by jet to the carrier for a tour Before the conference, being held at the Grand Hotel resort on Mobile Bay, most of the Republican governors made clear they support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on major domestic issues, including his pledge against new taxes. `` I think right now would be an inappropriate time to talk about new taxes,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>. `` If he believes he can do without taxes, I am going to support him,'' said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who did not plan to attend the conference because of a legislative session. His and <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>' comments were made in interviews before the start of the forum Castle said the conference this year was unique in that a new administration was coming into power and the president-elect planned to attend along with influential members of the new administration. `` We will be able to lay out some of our priorities,'' he said. <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> added, `` We want to develop an even better dialogue with the president-elect.'' <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, the host of the conference, was one of the few governors who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may yet switch from his no-tax stand. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may support an increase in taxes if necessary after `` you cut all the waste you possibly could.'' But, he said, `` not having looked at the books on the national level, I really could n't answer the question.'' <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> said he opposed more taxes, emphasizing that initiatives being taken at the state level are helping to reduce long-range government problems and costs. `` Welfare reform demonstrated the states' ability to put forward a workable solution to a complicated problem, one that will save a great deal of money in the long run by helping people get off welfare,'' he said. `` In virtually every area where the federal government mandates programs, I believe the states can do a better job in running them,'' <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Lack of public accountability and an inefficient bureaucracy have created a nightmare of sinking ships, rebels who escape from birthday parties and foodstocks that vanish. Some problems which have beset the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> recently can be explained by bad luck, including three tropical storms that killed more than 600 people in two weeks. But others appear the result of appalling lack of organization, resources and efficiency in President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s administration Lack of public accountability contributes to an atmosphere where accidents wait to happen. That in turn may be undermining public confidence in government. A recent survey by <ORGANIZATION> Ateneo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> 1,200 people nationwide found just 31 percent expected their lives to improve. Forty-two percent expected conditions to remain the same and 17 percent said they would get worse. `` It is not enough that the president sets the example,'' wrote the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> on the issue of accountability. `` She should also find the strength and conviction to make examples of officials who do not measure up.'' On Nov. 12, the alleged chief of the Communist rebel army escaped. The military says <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>, 41, and his wife <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON>, 38, walked away from a birthday party for the former stockade commandant. Acting stockade commander, Maj. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landrito </PERSON>, offered as an excuse that he was asleep in his office at the time. It was not the first security breach at the stockade. <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>'s host, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robelito </PERSON> <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>, was suspended last month when a right-wing officer jailed for a leading role in an August 1987 coup attempt reportedly walked through three doors that were supposed to be locked, climbed the stockade wall and was fatally shot by guards. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> today blamed the six military coup attempts that rocked her administration on her efforts to seek rapproachment with communist rebels during a 60-day cease-fire that expired in February 1987. `` The right-wing fringe of the military ... launched a succession of destabilizing attempts to topple me from power,'' she said. `` The assassination of leftist leaders discredited my commitment to human rights.'' In June, dozens of armed men tried to free former Gov. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulay </PERSON>, jailed in the 1986 deaths of several <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> supporters. Raiders failed to free Dulay but made off with armory weapons. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has demanded a full investigation into <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>'s escape Three senior officers, including <LOCATION> Landrito </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Comilang </PERSON>, have been relieved and restricted to quarters. But there is widespread skepticism about change. `` There has not been any real investigation, much less real punishment of people concerned,'' fumed Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a tendency to cover up. In the spirit of comradeship, they just cover up the incident to control the damage.'' <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>'s doubts were based on the failure of previous investigations to fix responsibility, punish those at fault and implement changes. Commissions failed to solve the September 1986 assassination of labor leader <PERSON> Rolando </PERSON> <PERSON> Olalia </PERSON>, the August killing of Local Governments Secretary <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> and the September 1987 slaying of leftist leader <PERSON> Lean </PERSON> <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON>. Another commission organized after the January 1987 killing of 13 land reform protesters by soldiers guarding the presidential palace never established who gave the order to fire. The senior officer on duty at the time, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, was furloughed as capital regional commander during the probe. But months later, he was promoted to major general and given command of the national police. Three separate commissions investigated the December 1987 collision of the passenger ship Dona Paz with the oil tanker, in which more than 3,000 people were believed to have perished. All three found evidence of widespread inefficiency in the maritime industry, including overloaded ships, lack of adequate communications, poorly trained crew and the absence of effective search and rescue procedures. But <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlito </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunanan </PERSON>, who as coast guard commandant was responsible for maritime safety, was promoted to navy commander after the Dona Paz disaster. Last month, the <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, another passenger ship owned by the same company, sailed into Typhoon Ruby and sank with 500 people aboard, about half of whom remain missing and feared dead. Although the investigations into the second sinking have not been completed, officials say they have found evidence of many of the same shortcomings which led to the Dona Paz disaster. `` The country is one big <PERSON> Dona </PERSON> <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> sinking in the middle of a storm while the captain snores on top of a mahjong table,'' wrote columnist <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatad </PERSON>. `` Many -LRB- heads -RRB- should roll.'' Lack of accountability has not been limited to the military. In September, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ong </PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> after two investigating committees found evidence of widespread incompetence. They cited, among other things, the disappearance of $ 350,000 worth of rice, which <PERSON> Ong </PERSON> said sank on three barges. The coast guard had no record of the sinking. Ong was furloughed during the investigations, then fired. Two days after he was dismissed for incompetence, <PERSON> Ong </PERSON> was named presidential adviser for regional government affairs. Also in September, retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> quit as security chief of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s international airport, claiming he was powerless to stop rampant corruption there. Despite his allegations, most customs and immigration officials remain on the job there.

 A five-pound sculpture made out of butter that has gone rancid is not art, a court ruled Monday.

<HEAD>China Urges Soviets to Resume Afghan Pullout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The suspension of the Soviet troop pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is a worrisome move that could endanger a general worldwide trend toward detente, an official magazine said Monday. `` The various flashpoints in the world are interrelated in one way or another,'' the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. `` It was precisely the signing of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords on the Afghan question in April that led to dialogues and negotiations on many other regional issues, contributing to the general trend towards relaxation in international relations,'' the magazine said. The suspension of the Soviet troop withdrawal, announced Nov. 4, could `` weaken or even reverse the general trend toward detente,'' it said. The editorial did not mention any specific examples, but it may have been referring in part to improvements in Chinese-Soviet relations in recent months. The two countries split bitterly in the 1960s over ideological and strategic differences, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has refused to normalize relations until the Soviets remove their troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent troops there in 1979 to help replace one Marxist leader with another, and has kept them since to battle anti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> partially met another Chinese demand, to reduce its troop presence on the Chinese border. The third demand is to pressure its ally, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, to withdraw from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Chinese leaders' comments on the prospects for better relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have been more positive since the Soviets began their troop pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next month in the first working visit there by a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister since 1956. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> said recently that a Chinese-Soviet summit could be held as early as next year. In suspending its pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> blamed increased attacks by the Afghan guerrillas. But the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Review said the move `` raised doubts about whether the Soviets are going to live up to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement.'' `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ... should implement the agreement in earnest and withdraw all its military forces from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as scheduled,'' it said. `` It should not look for any pretexts to delay.''

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s state-run radio today said all 27 passengers and crew members aboard a Afghan transport plane died when it was shot down by Pakistani forces over the weekend. A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said the plane was flying several miles inside <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> airspace when it was attacked Saturday evening near the border town of <LOCATION> Parachinar </LOCATION>. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity said it was not clear how many people were aboard the plane. The Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said the An-26 plane was en route to the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> from the Afghan capital when technical trouble developed. The pilot put out a call for assistance but was ignored by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> authorities, the radio said. `` Instead of helping <LOCATION> pakistan </LOCATION> shelled surface-to-air rockets at the plane against all international laws and norms,'' said the radio broadcast. The Pakistani spokesman said: `` The plane was asked to identify itself and it did n't. It was going deeper into <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s territory when it was shot down.'' He did not say how contact had been made with the plane. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has repeatedly complained of air violations by neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The two countries signed a U.N.-mediated agreement in April providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops estimated to be in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Kremlin pulled out half of its troops Aug. 15. The remainder are expected to leave by Feb. 15, 1989. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been supporting the Marxist <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in its fight against U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents.

 <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION> voters today cast the first ballots in national elections Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> hopes will give him a parliamentary majority to ratify the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement. The controversial trade pact, which has dominated the rancorous campaign, would phase out all remaining tariffs on trade between the two countries starting Jan. 1. Polls opened at 9 a.m., beginning with the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast province of <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, which is in a time zone 90 minutes ahead of eastern standard time. Polls close at 8 p.m. Canadian evening television coverage was scheduled to start at 8 p.m. EST. Canadian television is delaying its coverage to western time zones so that voters can go the polls without knowing early results. British <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast, where polls close at 11 p.m. EST, could be decisive in any close race. Opposition leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has urged Canadians to vote for his <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because he opposes the trade agreement and is seeking `` to keep <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> Canadian.'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> revived his party's chances during the 51-day campaign by accusing <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of selling out <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, 49, in turn charged <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> with using `` scare tactics,'' including allegations the pact would wreck social programs and cost many Canadians their jobs. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> brought out his mother to show his committment to retirement benefits. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> voted in his home town of <LOCATION> Baie-Comeau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, where he told reporters he planned to spend the day walking in the snow and getting out the vote. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> was in his home town of <LOCATION> Oshawa </LOCATION>, an auto center in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, while <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> was the last to vote because of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastal time in his <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, home district. Polls in the campaign's final days showed <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had returned to favor after a two-month slide attributed to the effectiveness of the 59-year-old <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s attacks. The opinion surveys showed the governing Conservatives in good position to win a slim majority of the 295 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, which would allow the Canadian parliamentarians to ratify the 10-year trade pact. The leader who can muster a majority of at least 148 seats controls the government. The socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also opposes the free trade agreement and could play a decisive role in any close outcome. A poll Saturday by Gallup <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> indicated the Conservatives had the support of 40 percent of the decided respondents, the Liberals 35 percent and the New Democrats 22 percent. Turnout among <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 17.5 million eligible voters was expected to be higher than the 1984 elections, when about one in four did n't show up If successful, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> could become the first <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> prime minister to win successive majority governments since 1953. The Liberals were ousted in a 1984 landslide spearheaded by <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. Decisive results could be determined in the country's most populous provinces, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, after polls close there at 8 p.m. EST. But results may not be known until late at night because of polls closing in <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Support for the agreement is strong in French-speaking Quebec, and opposition runs high in English-speaking <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has asked for another term this time not only to go ahead with the free trade agreement but to extend economic policies he credited with creating 1.3 million jobs. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, like its more populous southern neighbor, is in the sixth year of an economic boom. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> maintains the trade pact he signed with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> guarantees future Canadian prosperity by assuring access to the much larger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The two countries have about $ 150 billion in annual trade. Advocates of the trade deal see a huge North American marketplace, with entrepeneurs on both sides of the border enjoying equal competitive access. The Liberals, who have played a dominant role in Canadian politics for much of this century, appeared in trouble at the outset of the campaign, with some predicting they could sink to third place behind the New Democrats. But <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> revived the party's chances with a strong nationalistic attack on the free trade agreement, calling it `` a bad deal for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' He accused <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of selling out the world's second-largest country, and tapped into powerful currents of nationalism dating to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s founding 121 years ago The Liberal leader, who served as prime minister for 79 days in 1984, argued that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s 26 million people would be overwhelmed by the larger population of 245 million and vastly greater economic power of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Free trade came to overshadow all other issues in a campaign that generated an unusual amount of interest throughout <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> as well as abroad. The trade pact, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, needs final Canadian parliamentary approval.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will travel to 15 American cities next year to get opinions about what world trade policy should be in the administration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunsdale </PERSON>, acting chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` Listening to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... the concerns of business executives, labor leaders, politicians and others interested in the impact of tariffs on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries and consumers ... is crucial if the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is to offer informed advice to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative,'' she said in a statement. At a briefing she added that other barriers to trade as well as tariffs will be discussed at the hearings to be held by the six-member commission. They will begin Jan. 30, 1989, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and conclude in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 4. Ms. <PERSON> Brunsdale </PERSON> said she expects that <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative, will be writing her in the next few weeks to outline the kind of information he wants. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> has been the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative in the `` <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round'' of negotiations with nearly 100 countries covering the entire range of international business, not only in manufactured goods but also in farm products and services such as banking and air traffic. A key meeting is due next month in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> is expected to resign his post afterwards and to be replaced after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office Jan. 20. The commission is a federal agency that decides whether imports hurt or threaten to hurt particular <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries, and it recommends what action should be taken. Its advice goes directly to the president. If the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> decides that an imported item has been sold in this country at less than its fair value, or has been subsidized by another government, it can issue an order imposing extra customs duties. It also makes extensive reports to the president and his advisers on trade issues.

 Three senior Solidarity advisers Monday said they were ready to discuss technical details of next week's live TV debate between <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the head of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s official trade union alliance The advisers also proposed holding the debate at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and also suggested that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most famous movie director, <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wajda </PERSON>, be allowed to film it.

Trade union pluralism will be the main issue discussed during the debate. Solidarity and the OPZZ hold opposing views on the number and organization of trade unions within factories and on the shop floor. An OPZZ official said the union was prepared for a meeting with the Solidarity advisers to discuss the debate's technical details. `` As far as I know if the representatives of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s side will come to us directly, if it concerns only technical details, I think we can hold such a meeting,'' said OPZZ Deputy Chairman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Uzieblo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Uzieblo </PERSON> said there will be no moderator, although other issues still must be worked out.

 <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, president-elect of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, hopes his meeting Tuesday with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will establish a personal bond and set the pattern for U.S.-Mexican relations. His task will not be easy, given the Mexican view that its powerful neighbor constantly tries to impose its political and economic will south of the border, but <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' advisers hope he and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president-elect will form the basis for a working relationsship. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, a Harvard-educated economist who takes office Dec. 1, will meet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for three hours Tuesday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> are men with open minds who are willing to listen to the interests and concerns of others. We have different problems and common interests,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who works in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Spanish initials PRI. As <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> sees it, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> must resume economic growth and can not do so without reducing the burden of payments on its $ 102 billion foreign debt, which drain economic resources and leave little money for development. Some Mexicans fear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government may see drug trafficking as the main bilateral problem and try to blame <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for letting drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The governments have managed to work out temporary or partial solutions to other problems, including water contamination along the border and access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets for Mexican products. Even foreign policy disagreements over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have been played down in recent years. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Celaya </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> congressman who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is becoming more aware of our economic realities. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must re-examine its policies in the region or it will risk the chance of being isolated geopolitically.'' He said the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> meeting underlines `` the need to resume and expand our dialogue and start the two new administrations with common points of view and programs for collaboration and development.'' Outgoing President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> had six meetings with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> marked by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands, often irritating to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, that it do more to fight drug trafficking. `` Our relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have always been difficult, so difficult that we lost half of our territory last century,'' de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said in an interview last month. `` Nowadays, it is a challenge for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to live next to the biggest, richest and most complex country in the world.'' Mexican foreign policy is often at odds with that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, especially in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and Mexicans feel <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials do not understand their culture and politics well enough. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is an easy target for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who complain of corruption and failure to stop the drug trafficig drug trafficking. The Mexicans say they do the best they can with limited resources. At his final meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, last February, de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> said bluntly the best way to fight the drugs was for citizens of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop using them.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspectors seized more than 1,400 pounds of high-grade cocaine with an estimated street value of $ 28 million, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The cocaine was found Nov. 11 in suburban <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> in a shipment of 55-gallon drums of resin from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, but announcement of the confiscation was delayed because Customs wanted to try to catch the buyers, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Orgeron </PERSON>. `` What we were trying to do was make a controlled delivery to see if we could make an arrest,'' said <PERSON> Orgeron </PERSON>. She said that was done last week, but no arrests were made and the 1,424 pounds of the drug was turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Sixty-eight <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> inmates, including convicted killers, will head home for Thanksgiving on Tuesday as part of the state's holiday furlough program. A variety of criminals who have maintained good records and cleared a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> screening will earn the furloughs, said interim Corrections Commissioner <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Although no estimate of the total number of inmates heading home this year was available, 68 are scheduled to depart Tuesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Holiday furloughs usually range from three to 10 days. During the last holiday season, 539 inmates were allowed out on furlough, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who signs inmates' passes, said he strongly considered calling off the furloughs in the wake of a $ 3 million verdict against three former state <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> members. The members, who voted to release an inmate who later shot and paralyzed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> bank executive <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>, were found by a <ORGANIZATION> Hinds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury to be negligent in the case filed by Ms. <PERSON> Grantham </PERSON>. Parole and holiday furloughs are separate programs. But the precedent has been set for liability if an inmate on release injures someone, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We are going to have a Christmas leave program this year as in the past, but because of recent happenings, we are going to be more strict on screening people and not going to go over it once, but go over it twice to make sure we have covered every base,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. State law allows the corrections commissioner to grant personal leave to certain inmates. Only trusty inmates are eligible for consideration. They must have served a set minimum part of their sentences, ranging from eight months on a one-year sentence to at least four years of any sentence of 21 years to life, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> law specifically bars special leave for any person convicted of a sex crime, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, while <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rules bar other inmates, including those sentenced to terms without hope of parole.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Monday his eldest son, <PERSON> Odai </PERSON>, bludgeoned to death a presidential bodyguard, and he ordered an investigation into the slaying. In a letter to the minister broadcast on state radio, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON> was killed the night of Oct. 18 when the trusted bodyguard was firing his gun in a private villa near the presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> sent his own bodyguard to ask <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON> to stop shooting, but <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON> did not obey. <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> and his bodyguard went to see why <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON> disobeyed him, as well as a presidential order that prohibits firing personal weapons during celebrations. <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> went to <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON> and asked him if he received his order to stop shooting and when the bodyguard said yes, <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> hit him with a wooden bat. <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON> was rushed to a hospital where he died the next day from a head wound. <PERSON> Odai </PERSON>, 25, is the oldest of the president's five children. In <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, sources said the bodyguard was particularly close to the president and a distraught <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> accompanied <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON>'s body to a church for funeral preparations The guard, believed to be in his 20s, was the son of the president's cook and the governess of his three daughters, the sources said. They detailed a different version of the killing circulating in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> firing the gun and the bodyguard killed while trying to quiet him. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said he investigated the murder and referred the case `` so that justice is done.'' He said <PERSON> Odai </PERSON> is in jail and has tried to commit suicide three times since <PERSON> Gegeo </PERSON> died. The president described his Gegeo as a trusted person and `` a man who never disobeyed him.'' He said his son had not committed such a crime before and described the murder as `` a will of God which can not be prevented.'' `` It is my constitutional responsibility to enforce justice in the society ... and that does not exempt anyone,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in his letter. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> ordered Justice Minister <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Qader </PERSON> <PERSON> Douri </PERSON> to investigate the death.

<HEAD>Soviet Military To Make Plumbing Parts to Ease Housing Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s vast defense industry will be turning out plumbing parts for use in a crash program to build more housing, a government official said Monday. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batalin </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, or cabinet, said the military has the facilities for manufacturing the items needed, so defense plants will be put to work turning out the equipment. `` This is happening because available capacities in the defense industry will be reoriented. Rather than producing armaments, they will produce plumbing items,'' <PERSON> Batalin </PERSON> told a news briefing. The involvement of the military in civilian housing programs is just one way Soviets hope to tap various sources for increasing the country's stock of construction equipment and supplies. One city dweller in five lives in a dormitory or communal apartment shared with other families. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has proclaimed the goal of building enough new housing so each Soviet family can have its own apartment or house by the year 2000. In February, the government announced a plan for citizens to take out large bank loans to build private homes. But even for the enterprising, housing construction often is frustrated by lack of necessary materials. `` The market resources will have to grow,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyev </PERSON>, deputy Soviet minister for material and technical supplies. `` We will have to provide the market with the needed materials.'' <PERSON> Boyev </PERSON> said officials understand the shortage of supplies and are trying to speed up production of everything from plumbing parts to linoleum. He said his department made 20,000 square yards of linoleum in 1985 and expects to make 57,000 square yards next year. Individual credits for housing construction are not new, but had been issued on a limited basis until the announcement of the private loan program. Last year, the government provided $ 720 million and in 10 months of this year will have provided $ 2.8 billion, <PERSON> Batalin </PERSON> said. Private construction had been discouraged in official attempts to cut down on pilferage of hard-to-come-by building materials from state enterprises. <PERSON> Batalin </PERSON> said recent changes to permit more economic autonomy in the country's 15 constituent republics will create more of a marketplace atmosphere, alleviating the shortages of materials. N.A. <PERSON> Nazarbayev </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kazakhstan </ORGANIZATION>, one of five Central Asian republics, said the exchange of goods between the republics had at times been arbitrary and unresponsive to needs. For instance, he said, <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> provides the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> with grain and receives footwear in return, when what <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> really needs is timber, which is plentiful in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nazarbayev </PERSON> said the self-financing plan will permit the republics to barter or sell products directly for much-needed supplies, adding impetus to the housing construction program.

 More than 100 world leaders passed along greetings of peace Monday in the 16th annual World Hello Day organized by two <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> brothers. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> were among the participants this year in the unofficial ritual designed to promote world peace with a series of simple `` hellos.'' `` I guess when you get the heads of states of 100 countries together on anything you have really accomplished something,'' co-founder <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, 36, was attending <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 when he and his brother <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, 31, started World Hello Day in response to the growing tension in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Since then, the annual event that involves greeting at least 10 people in the name of peace has attracted international attention. The brothers received letters of support this year from the leaders of 101 countries, ranging from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Last week a letter arrived from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with a `` warm hello'' from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and on Monday the brothers heard from the secretary general of the League of <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Others who have participated in World Hello Day include Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, the late Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, Bishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> and former Presidents <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said he has received thousands of letters this year from everyday people, but it is the notes from famous leaders that draw the most attention. `` The president of <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -RRB- told me that one of the things World Hello Day does is mobilize people to act in a specific way to promote peace. It gives them a taste of what it is like to participate in that process,'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said. Letters have arrived from Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michener </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pele </PERSON>. `` You talk about a grassroots movement that goes from the ground up,'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said. `` What we have done is work from the other direction _ from the crowns of the trees down to the roots. People are interested when they say their own head of state has written a letter and supports World Hello Day.'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, who devotes all his time to the annual event, said he does n't have much interest in trying to gain official national status for World Hello Day in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think what we would like to do is keep it a day that becomes a special day because people want to make it a special day on their own, not because it is an official holiday,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Tombstone Conditions Give A History Of Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> researchers have found that marble tombstones provide a unique record of air pollution that shows the clean-up efforts of the last two decades appear to be working. By measuring the deterioration rates of about 2,000 tombstones in cemeteries from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Norristown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, geography professor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meierding </PERSON> and graduate student <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Feddema </PERSON> have produced an outline of air pollution history in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The study found extensive differences in pollution levels between areas and suggests that pollutants that have nearly dissolved some headstones likely have extensively damaged other structures. Many tombstones in central <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> _ the hardest-hit area in the study _ are so weakened from decades of sulfur dioxide deposits that they `` flex under slight pressure,'' <PERSON> Feddema </PERSON> said. Their surfaces are so disfigured from flaking that many inscriptions have disappeared. In contrast, tombstones examined in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> cemeteries show less wear, and those in areas with excellent air quality, such as <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and rural <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, show almost no deterioration. The researchers surveyed tombstones placed between 1790 and 1840, restricting their study for the most part to markers made from marble extracted from southeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> quarries. They measured the base and tops of 30 tombstones in each cemetery and compiled an average weathering figure per cemetery. The difference between the bases and the tops, which were more exposed to the wind-borne pollutants, showed the rate at which the stones deteriorated. The researchers calculated the deterioration rate according to a 100-year scale and found that an urban tombstone may deteriorate at 10 times the rate of a stone in a rural graveyard. They also found that a distance of even a few miles from an industrial area can lead to markedly different pollution rates. For example, the destruction of tombstone faces by pollutants was as high as 47 percent in central <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> but only 2 percent in the nearby countryside. Because tombstones are widespread, remain relatively untouched over time and are easily damaged by air-borne pollutants, they present a fairly simple gauge for air quality, said <PERSON> Meierding </PERSON>, who has been awarded a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> grant to survey pollution patterns in tombstones nationwide. The researchers said the tombstones appear to have been most affected by gaseous sulfur dioxide, which spurs the growth of gypsum crystals that cause marble to shed large flakes and lose strength. However, both <PERSON> Feddema </PERSON> and Meierding believe acid rain, which can carry pollutants great distances, has made only a slight contribution to the deterioration. They point instead to local sources of pollution, such as coal-fired power plants, steel mills and refineries. The pioneering study, reviewed last week during an environmental forum in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, also suggests: _ The worst pollution damage occurred between the 1930s and 1960s _ Sulfur dioxide damage to marble tombstones probably depicts the way air pollutants have damaged building materials like cement, brick and metal _ Air pollution controls to limit emissions installed in the last two decades appear to be working After 1970, rates of deterioration in tombstones seem to have improved, reflecting the cleaner skies. _ The comparison of tombstone damage may be used to compare the costs of pollution damage between regions If central <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> has suffered 10 times the pollution of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, costs associated with that pollution should be 10 times more in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, he said.

 Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> today became the second <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressman to be indicted in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> corruption scandal. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a six-term Democrat; his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>; and a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, attorney, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on bribe-related conspiracy charges. The indictment was released by the office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. The prosecutor said today that the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> investigation is continuing. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was the 18th person to be indicted in the past decade to be indicted on criminal charges while serving in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 55, a Democrat from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, easily turned away primary and general election challenges to win a sixth term earlier this month. Through his spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Danvers </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said he was innocent and vowed to fight the charges `` with all of my God-given strength.'' `` I am grateful that this period of trial by grand jury leaks is finally over,'' the statement said. He said the charges stemmed from `` the preposterous allegations of <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, one of the most notorious felons of the 20th century.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> was one of four <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials who pleaded guilty to bribing government authorities and cooperated with prosecutors. He had testified that <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and his wife had received money and jewelry as bribes for their work on behalf of the now bankrupt defense contractor. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was the second person of Puerto Rican descent to be elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Former Rep. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Badillo </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was the first. On Friday, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Democrat, was sentenced to eight years in prison for his part in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. He and several others were convicted in August of turning <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a now-defunct defense contractor, into a cash cow that produced millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was a tiny <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop that grew into a multimillion-dollar-a-year defense contractor through a <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> program that allowed minority-owned firms to obtain government contracts without competitive bidding. But allegations of bribery, influence-peddling and other wrongdoing, enmeshed <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in a series of federal and state investigations that forced it into bankruptcy proceedings in December 1986. To date, at least 19 people caught up in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal have been convicted of crimes ranging from racketeering to illegal lobbying. They include former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>, who was convicted of illegal lobbying, and two former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> state senators, convicted of taking $ 50,000 in bribes from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. Two one-time associates of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> have also been indicted on Wedtech-related racketeering charges and are scheduled to go on trial early next year. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was never indicted, although a special prosecutor questioned the former attorney general's ethics after a lengthy investigation.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Monday proposed a rule imposing tighter restrictions on the ability of state-chartered banks to acquire non-banking subsidiaries. The rule, proposed by a 6-1 vote with board member <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> dissenting, would require that the approximately 7,000 state-chartered banks owned by holding companies get the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s permission before estabishing real estate, insurance and other non-banking subsidiaries Proponents of the rule say some states have moved aggressively to authorize new activities without regard for bank safety and soundness. Opponents say the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> should not seek more power over state banks. Regulation Y, adopted in 1971, has allowed state banks to purchase non-bank firms without <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> approval under the Bank Holding Company Act. The change could be adopted in three to six months. It would exempt non-bank businesses already owned by state-chartered banks, although <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vice </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> staff to solicit comment on the possibility of requiring divestiture of such activities.

Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> made no immediate ruling on lawyer <PERSON> Hans-Burkhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Steck </PERSON>'s request for a psychiatrist. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air piracy in the hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 after it left <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in June 1985. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admits he was one of the hijackers but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> `` appears to be an adult in many things, but is a child that had been hindered in his development.'' He said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was `` mentally disturbed at the time of the hijacking'' but had wanted `` a bloodless hijacking.'' `` The mental and physical damage'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had suffered from fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` should have an influence on the sentence.'' While <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> spoke, the mother of the slain diver, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, walked out of the courtroom, apparently fighting back tears. She and her husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, have followed all 34 sessions since the trial opened July 5. Later, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> Vincente </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> testified that his son-in-law, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trautmann </PERSON>, was among several hostages taken off the plane at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and hidden in the city. `` I thought he could be the first to be shot, and I asked <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> ` do n't take him away, take me.' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> just pushed me back,'' said <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 57, his voice cracking with emotion. Another American testified that she feared the hijackers would harm her because she is Jewish. `` I heard screams and beatings on more than one occasion,'' said <PERSON> Mauri </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, a 36-year-old computer saleswoman. `` I was very afraid because I am Jewish and I did n't know if they knew it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said she saw one passenger ask for medical help because he had a heart condition `` but the hijackers refused.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denied this when asked to comment. `` If anyone had asked me for a doctor, I would have done that,'' he said. The court Monday completed cross-examining Dr. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, whose testimony was interrupted Nov. 15 when <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said he felt ill. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> appeared `` less wild and less mean'' than his accomplice, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, who is a fugitive `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> -RRB- was not kind and nice and good, but in my mind he was less frightening,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. Under court guidelines to protect witnesses, former hostages do not reveal their hometowns. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1987 after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> requested his extradition last year, but the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government turned it down, fearing for the lives of two West Germans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The hostages since have been released. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, is serving a 13-year prison term in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in connection with the kidnappings.

<HEAD>Baby Walkers, Crib Gyms Top This Year's Dangerous Toys List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parents who go Christmas shopping for their kids should beware _ there are more dangerous toys than ever before, a consumer group warned Monday. While there are a variety of specific toys which are potentially harmful, entire classes of toys _ baby walkers and crib gyms _ were singled out as dangerous by the <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the Americans for Democratic Action. The 17th annual report of the private, non-profit organization also was critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the federal agency which oversees toys and other consumer goods. A `` major reason for the abundance of dangerous toys'' is `` the pitiful ineptitude'' of the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>, the report said. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyrrell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency would not have any comment because it had n't yet seen the report. But she noted that the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> soon will issue its own set of Christmas toy guidelines. The report said `` dangerous and potentially dangerous toys are more available than ever this year. Our consumer group was inundated by potentially dangerous toys.'' The report cited <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> statistics which blamed toys for causing 131,000 injuries last year, including 105,000 to kids under 15 years old. Baby walkers can tip over or topple down stairs, making them `` highly dangerous,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> received 20,790 injury reports last year from baby walkers, the group noted. Crib gyms have caused 12 deaths and 662 other injuries in the past five years, the report said. `` Warnings are n't enough. Crib gyms need to be designed in the first place without hazards,'' the report said. `` Babies begin to enjoy crib gyms just at the age that parents are advised to remove them. So human nature enters the picture and parents leave the crib gyms a little longer.'' Among the toys cited by the <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION> panel as potentially dangerous: _ Inflatable sleds, some of which throw up snow that could blind the driver _ Flammable items, including stuffed animals _ Household-type toys urging children to imitate adults in a dangerous fashion The report cited an electric oven which could burn a kid and a toy iron that has a realistic-looking plug that could send children to the nearest electrical outlet. _ Items which could be dangerous if broken One example cited was a toy doctor's kit which included realistic-looking plastic instruments that could break when a child puts them up to his face, throat, ears or eyes. _ Items dangerous for babies, including rattles that do n't meet specified width requirements A baby could choke on that rattle, the report said. _ Toys with inadequate or misleading age labels In some instances, manufacturers label a product containing small parts as `` for ages over 3,'' but it still appeals to younger kids. Parents who go toy shopping in the next month should keep several things in mind, the report noted, including: _ Safety Look for sharp edges, small parts, projectiles and potential danger if the toy breaks. Toys with fabric in them should say the material is flame retardant or flame resistant. Painted toys should be non-toxic. _ Look at the toy, not the box Examine the contents to make sure it is the same as what's pictured outside. _ Consider the toy's play value Will the child enjoy it more than once or be bored after 15 minutes? _ Batteries Few toys include batteries. _ Save sales receipts Some stores will match the price of their competition. _ Read the directions Avoid toys with instructions that are too complicated. _ Check newspaper ads Popular toys may go on sale just before Christmas and be more readily available late in the season. _ Consider the child's age Good toys should not require constant supervision to ensure safety or correct use. _ Avoid `` hot'' items They might be cheaper next year, and ads overglamorize them.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Sets Chicago Mayoral Vote Next Spring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> set the stage Monday for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s third mayoral free-for-all in six years, ruling that voters must decide who serves the last two years of the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s term. Siding with city officials who scheduled a Feb. 28 primary and an April 4 general election next year, rather than waiting until 1991, the court said Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s appointment by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death does not extend through 1991, when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s term ends. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> died of a heart attack on Nov. 25, 1987, less than eight months after winning a second term. The seven justices ruled without written dissent that state laws governing vacancies in office were designed to ensure that an appointed official would not serve such a long portion of an unexpired term. Supporters of a 1991 election had argued their case was supported by the state Election Code, which says the mayor of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> should be chosen in a spring election every four years beginning in 1979. The court said that only prescribes regularly scheduled elections `` where the incumbent official continues in office.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who supported a 1991 election but has indicated he is prepared to run next year, said he was `` pleased that this decision has been made and that the people in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are no longer in limbo.'' `` We are ready for the upcoming election and look forward to winning it,'' said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who raised nearly $ 3 million in less than a year against the possibility of a spring election. The ruling also drew applause from the field of announced and would-be candidates poised to make next year's mayoral race the most crowded in the city's recent history. `` I think it's the decision the public wanted,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, a staunch <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ally who was among the first to announce his candidacy for a 1989 mayoral race. `` They did n't want 29 members of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to elect their mayor for three years.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, widely reported to be planning a second bid for the job his father held for two decades, said he would make an announcement `` in the next two weeks.'' `` This is a serious decision,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aldermen </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, both considered leading contenders for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s mantle of black political leadership in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, also praised the decision. According to a recent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Sun-Times-ABC television poll, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is supported by 37 percent of all voters. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> was second at 22 percent, <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> third with 10 percent, and <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> fourth with 9 percent. The remaining 22 percent was divided among the other announced candidates _ <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> _ and `` undecided.'' The possibility of three black candidates _ <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> _ raises the possibility of a split in the black voting bloc that made <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the city's first black mayor in 1983, and lifted him to re-election in 1987. Such a split would strengthen <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, who split the white vote with former Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> in a 1983 Democratic primary and thus helped <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> move into the general election, in which Democrats historically have been prohibitive favorites. No Republican has been <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s mayor for more than half a century. Monday's court ruling came in a suit filed in April by <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>' supporters, who sought the early election in an effort to deny <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> time to consolidate his power

<HEAD>Reagan Library Faced Ideological, Environmental Pitfalls</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Reagan Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sponsors of a library documenting the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency have had to steer around a variety of pitfalls, from liberal <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professors to a rare six-inch sunflower. Groundbreaking here Monday for the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Presidential Library was made possible by a compromise with environmentalists that protects the sunflower and two other rare plants. Before that, the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> had to overcome concerns that the project would detract from a section of rolling coastal mountain range set aside by local planners as a protected area. And all that came after the foundation abandoned its original plans to construct the library on a 20-acre Northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> site at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION> in conjunction with a proposed policy center. Neighbors of the university had complained about expected tourist traffic, while liberal professors did n't want the campus used to enshrine the memory of a conservative champion. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>'s trustees split the library from the proposed policy center in 1984, but planning for the library continued into 1987, up to the point that blueprints were unveiled with fanfare in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In April 1987, the foundation canceled its <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> plans, publicly citing the separation three years earlier of the library from the policy center. In the ensuing months, a number of potential sites in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were rumored to be under consideration, including the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, Riverside and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. But the nod went to a site outside <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, some 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a former country town that has become a bedroom community. The library will be set in dry hills covered with scrub brush and dotted with cactus _ perhaps a fitting setting for the first president whose start in public life was as a cowboy actor. Community concerns, more muted this time, centered on visitor traffic and the location in an area set aside as a natural buffer between three growing communities. Environmentalists envisioned bulldozers rumbling over the tiny yellow sunflower known to scientists as Pentachaeta lyonii, as well as two other rare plants. But environmental objections were headed off by compromise: The foundation will try to replace any plants it destroys, work to protect and spread the species on the site, and limit public hours to minimize traffic.

 <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> died of acute pulmonary edema, or accumulation of fluid in her lungs, a judge said Monday. Investigators reportedly were focusing on whether the Greek heiress died from an overdose of barbiturates. Judge <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinali </PERSON> said the cause of death was included in a partial report he received from forensic experts who performed the autopsy on Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> following her death Saturday, apparently of a heart attack. Heart attacks can cause the accumulation of fluid in the lungs, or pulmonary edema. Medical examiners reportedly were looking into various possible causes of death. <PERSON> Cardinali </PERSON> was quoted by the private news agency <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Argentinas </ORGANIZATION> as saying investigators were focusing on the possible `` excessive ingestion of barbiturates.'' Family members and friends repeatedly have ruled out suicide. Three jars of medicine and other evidence found in Miss Onassis' bedroom were taken by police Sunday for analysis, the private news agency <ORGANIZATION> Diarios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday Another bottle of pills reportedly was missing. Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, the 37-year-old daughter of Greek shipping magnate <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, died at the country club home of close friends. One of three doctors who allegedly examined Miss Onassis at the country club and pronounced her dead was questioned by police and two judges who have jurisdiction in the case, <ORGANIZATION> Diaros </ORGANIZATION> y <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> reported. Miss Onassis frequently went on diets to combat a persistent weight problem, and she was known to take diet pills. It was not known if she was on diet pills at the time of her death. Tissues taken from Miss Onassis' body at an autopsy Saturday still were being examined, <PERSON> Cardinali </PERSON>'s secretary said in a telephone interview. The full coroner's report was expected to be delivered to <PERSON> Cardinali </PERSON> later Monday. It was unclear whether he would publicly disclose its contents. The judge said he still is awaiting a determination on the cause of the edema as well as results of a chemical analysis and other pathological studies performed on the body. Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> was the stepdaughter of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, the widow of President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who married <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> in 1968. When her father died in 1975, Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> inherited half of the family's estimated $ 1 billion fortune. The other half is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Alexander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Onassis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, set up in memory of <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' only son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who died in a 1973 plane crash Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> had four unsuccessful marriages. Her last husband, French industrialist <PERSON> Thierry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON>, arrived Monday from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to wrap up legal proceedings and accompany the body to Skorpios, the <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> family's island in the <LOCATION> Ionian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off the northwest coast of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> is the father of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' only child, 3-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Athena </ORGANIZATION>, who stands to inherit her mother's entire fortune. <PERSON> Roussel </PERSON> will have custody of the child until she comes of age. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Clarin </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that Miss Onassis intended within the next two weeks to marry <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Tchomlekdjoglou </PERSON>, brother of her longtime friend and weekend host in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodero </PERSON>. The newspaper cited sources it did not identify in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>' Greek community Telephone calls placed to the homes of the Doderos, the family Tchomlekdjoglou and Miss Onassis' aunt, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, were unanswered. On Saturday, Miss <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> was taken from <ORGANIZATION> Tortuguitas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, 25 miles north of the capital, to a private clinic and then to <LOCATION> Clinica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, where she was pronounced dead on arrival. Federal Judge <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Piotti </PERSON>, whose district includes <ORGANIZATION> Tortuguitas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, prohibited the removal of Miss Onassis' body from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> without his authorization, citing `` errors of procedure'' in transfering the body from his district to <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s incoming President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> meet Tuesday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in a bid to move cross-border relations onto a smoother track after an extended period of recriminations <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week that with new administrations in both countries taking office at about the same time, a `` tremendous opportunity'' is available for a cooperative relationship. Last Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conferred at length on the meeting with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised that after taking office he will take no measures that affect <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> without first consulting Mexican authorities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be accompanied to the luncheon meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> by Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who will be inaugurated on Dec. 1, will be accompanied by top aides as well. Economic issues will be at the top of the agenda, but the discussions also are expected to touch on drug smuggling, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other issues. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has said that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s obligations in servicing its $ 108 billion foreign debt should be designed in a way that permits continued economic growth. He is worried that protectionist trade pressures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could lead to a decline in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s cross-border exports, further aggravating an economic crisis that has afflicted the country since 1982. A rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates also would impair <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s ability to repay its debt. While the two countries have shown an ability to cooperate on economic issues, there have been serious disagreements over <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and drugs. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said that, aside from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, no hemispheric country has supported <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government more enthusiastically than <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which has played a leading role in the Central American peace process. In the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> supported the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on issues of high priority to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> less than 15 per cent of the time, according to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. One official, insisting on anonymity, said Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> have a `` shoot on sight'' relationship. Both <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sepulveda </PERSON> will be replaced by their respective incoming presidents. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said there are preliminary indications that the new foreign ministry team being assembled by <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> may be less ideologically opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration views. In a recent interview, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, `` We have been very unhappy with what we consider the kind of ideological tone in some of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign policy as distinct from a pragmatic tone. `` There have been occasions when we felt that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was picking a fight with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not because it was in the interest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to do so, for what must have been complex reasons in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s foreign policy and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s domestic politics.'' One recent sign of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s pursuit of an independent foreign policy was a visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> by outgoing <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, who conferred <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s highest civilian decoration on President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. On the drug issue, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> believes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bears much of the blame for continued narcotics trafficking across the border because of the strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for drugs. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been increasingly emphasizing a need to reduce demand but maintains that `` corruption and inefficiencies'' in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have impeded efforts to curb the drug flow. According to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the principal source country for the production, processing and trafficking of heroin and marijuana entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 A marble-and-brass monument commemorating <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s visits to the <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> area has been found nearly 25 years after it was cast and stored to await the opening of the presidential library in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, a member of the committee that commissioned the monument in 1964 in the wake of the president's assassination, said Monday that he discovered the monument in a <ORGANIZATION> Wolcott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> storage room in September. He said he did n't tell anyone about the discovery until recently so the news would coincide with the 25th anniversary of the assassination on Tuesday. The <PERSON> Wolcott </PERSON> residents who commissioned the monument intended to send it to the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> campus in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section. `` I think once they -LRB- at the library -RRB- see this, it's really the kind of a monument _ it's probably valued at $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 _ that belongs there,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. The white marble plaque with a brass plate, the cost of which was underwritten by the <ORGANIZATION> Scovill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Copper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, both of <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, memorializes <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s visits to <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION> on the eve of the 1960 election and in 1962.

His mother, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, attended, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` The problem -LRB- in 1964 -RRB- was that the Kennedy Library had not been built yet, so the plaque had to be stored somewhere until the library was complete,'' he recalled. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said he suggested keeping it in a closet in the high school. The monument was promptly forgotten, he said. He said he had intended to bring it to the library on the assassination anniversary, but the library's curator and one-time <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> assistant, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, reminded him that `` the family does n't prefer to remember that date.'' Instead, <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said he will take the plaque to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> next year on May 29, the late president's birthday. Powers said the library will accept the plaque, but he could n't say whether or not it will be displayed

 <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said Monday he was surprised by reports that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was about to name him chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said he was sitting at home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> watching television when he first heard news reports over the weekend that he was about to be appointed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief economic adviser. `` I was quite suprised by the rumors,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It is flattering to have my name mentioned as a possibility, but President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has many outstanding individuals who would make excellent appointments to the CEA.'' A conservative economist and expert on the Social Security system, <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> is the father of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` flexible freeze'' idea to drive down the deficit. He is still considered the front-runner to be named chairman of the economic council. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, when asked by reporters on Monday what had happened to <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>'s appointment, said, `` Nothing happened. Just do n't believe all the leaks you read in the newspapers.'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, co-director of the transition, said, `` We have a high regard for him. We're still working on the chairman's appointment. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> called reports of the appointment `` premature'' and said he has not yet received any offer of a job in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, who described himself as a `` mainstream conservative,'' said he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will move quickly and decisively to assemble an outstanding team to assist him in the transition and the government. But this wo n't happen overnight. It may take a few weeks.'' He praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as head of <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, saying, `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> is one of the most talented people I know.'' In addition to <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> director, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to stay on in his administration. That leaves the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> as the only top economic post remaining to be filled. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that he considered the naming of his economic team to be a priority as a way of sending a signal to jittery financial markets that the new administration planned to get a quick start in reducing the federal budget deficit.

 For Thanksgiving dinner, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> used to fix herself a small salad while the rest of her family sat down to turkey and dressing. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> skipped dinner altogether one year and instead took an overdose of pills. What should have been a holiday was a nightmare for the two women because they suffered from anorexia. The thought of a bountiful feast spread out before them repulsed them. But this year, both <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> will sit down to a traditional Thanksgiving meal with several hundred others who suffer from eating disorders. The dinner is a part of the annual National Eating Disorders Week originated by their doctor, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON>, a child psychiatrist who specializes in treating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. `` It's kind of like a homecoming,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, who asked that her last name be withheld. `` You feel a little more comfortable sitting with people who you know have the same problem. It's a little easier to eat.'' The dinner will be a traditional one, with all the trimmings: roast turkey, dressing, wild rice, broccoli, glazed carrots, mixed fruit, dinner rolls, cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie and carrot cake. Victims of anorexia refuse to eat because they believe themselves fat even when they're dangerously underweight, while bulimia sufferers binge and purge, eating sometimes enormous amounts of food and then throwing up. Most of those who suffer from these eating disorders are young, white women, bt more and more cases are being diagnosed among men, blacks, Asians and children. <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON> is the founder of <ORGANIZATION> BASH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which stands for Bulimia Anorexia Self-Help. Based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, it is an internationally known program for people with eating disorders. The annual dinner began five years ago to help <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON>'s patients shift the focus of the Thanksgiving holiday away from food. `` The idea is to socialize, to get reacquainted,'' he said. `` The dinner is played down.'' The first dinner was held after <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> tried to commit suicide with the overdose she took while home from college for Thanksgiving. `` She said she could n't handle it, she hated the holiday,'' <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON> said. `` People talked about food and insisted everybody take seconds.'' `` It was a miracle she survived, but she made it and lived.'' Last year, about 300 past and present patients of <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON>'s, their families and friends attended the meal. In conjunction with the meal, seminars and workshops on eating and mood disorders are offered. BASH is the outpatient program for the BASH <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, based at <ORGANIZATION> Deaconess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The program, which <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON> founded in 1981, seeks to restore proper eating habits to patients through behavior modification, individual and group therapy and nutritional guidance. Both anorexia and bulimia can be fatal. Besides malnutrition, victims of eating disorders can suffer electrolyte imbalances, which can cause abnormal heart rhythms, and amenorrhea, the loss of menstruation. Frequent vomiting by bulimics can lead to tooth decay. One victim was pop singer <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, who died in 1983 at the age of 33 of complications of anorexia. Sufferers also can become addicted to diet pills and laxatives, which can lower the body's potassium content, making heart failure a risk. <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON> said compulsive exercising is now being recognized as yet another tool for people who suffer eating disorders. `` Exercise addicts start quite innocently,'' he said. `` But once they get caught in the treadmill of exercise, they suffer anxiety when they ca n't get their fix.'' <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON>'s self-help program began with a suggestion from several of his anorexic and bulimic patients, who met in a group with him once a month, that a meeting that included relatives of people with eating disorders would be beneficial. BASH now reaches some 6,000 people in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area, and with the distribution of its newsletter, more than 15,000 people around the world, <PERSON> Larocca </PERSON> said. It also operates a 24-hour toll-free crisis hotline. Both <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> have recovered, although they still find the meetings helpful for dealing with self-image problems. `` Now I do n't feel I have to go so much for myself, but to help other people,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, who spent one Thanksgiving in the hospital being fed through tubes. `` It's just amazing that knowing that other people have been through the same things helps a lot.''

<HEAD>GAO Calls for Flexibility in Production Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New farm legislation should include more flexibility in the control of crop production so that producers can respond more readily to market opportunities, a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report, one of a series about issues in the forthcoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, said the anticipated 1990 farm bill needs to retain the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to influence crop production in times of surplus and scarcity. But the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the current farm law, enacted in 1985, has had several shortcomings. The law has helped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture to become more competitive in the world market while maintaining farm income, the report said. `` This success, however, has come at a cost much higher than that of previous farm bills,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Between fiscal years 1986 and 1988, farm price and income support programs averaged over $ 20 billion annually.'' Farm programs should be designed to `` prevent the accumulation of unneeded surpluses'' and still hold down the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s costs of operating them, the report said. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> budget figures, spending on farm commodity supports soared to a record $ 25.8 billion in fiscal 1986, the first year of operation under the 1985 law, but have declined since then. `` The 1985 farm bill moved farm programs in a more market-oriented direction,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` However, rigidities in the bill's production control provisions have discouraged farmers from producing certain crops, even when commerical market conditions are favorable.'' For example, it said, the programs this year affected decisions of farmers in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION>, who maintained their level of corn plantings and did not expand their soybeans despite a strong soybean market relative to corn. `` Increases in soybean acres may have improved market returns for agriculture and tempered production expansion by foreign producers who compete with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers in world markets,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> modified the law this year in response to the drought to allow soybeans to be planted on corn acres in 1989 without farmers losing future benefits under the corn program. `` The 1990 farm bill debate should focus on such alternatives that retain <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to influence crop production but provide more flexibility to respond to market opportunities,'' the report said.

 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the world's second-largest country sprawling across six time zones, forbids broadcasters from spreading election results while polls remain open. That means election coverage starts at 8 p.m. local time in each zone as the polls close, unlike the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system where the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast receives network coverage while voting continues. `` We've got six time zones; that's why we've got to be very cautious,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> agency. `` Of course, it's very difficult today in the age of comunications to limit it _ but it's still done.'' <PERSON> Mackay </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> that the law prohibits broadcasters from talking about election results while polls remain open in any particular time zone. `` It's still possible to phone somebody in the East and say, ` What's going on?''' <PERSON> Bazay </PERSON> said. The majority of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s population lives in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, which are on Eastern Standard Time. Those two provinces account for 10.7 million of the 17.5 million voters registered for Monday's election and 174 of the 295 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> That leads to complaints from those who live farther west, especially <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which has 32 seats, where polls close three hours later. `` It's very simple,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazay </PERSON>, executive producer of the public Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s network news, said when asked to explain the system. `` We do it every day as a matter of course. Our national news basically has five editions.'' Election programming for <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, where polls close at 6:30 p.m. EST, can start in the central studio in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and be broadcast regionally. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and Prince <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> is added an hour later, then <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. `` We have a network. We can put the entire national network together, or parts of it together,'' <PERSON> Bazay </PERSON> said. `` As the polls close across the country, we simply put on election coverage. ... It's not complicated at all.'' The private Canadian TV network also was planning coverage starting at 8 p.m. local time. Global was not starting its coverage until about 10:15 p.m., after the conclusion of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> game between <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Satellite and cable television are increasingly available to Canadian households. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontbriand </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said it was the responsibility of each satellite and cable licensee to comply with the election law.

 Women will have 50 percent more restrooms than men in new public buildings in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, as officialdom tries to compensate for the different lengths of time the sexes spend in the bathroom. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> proposed the `` potty parity'' revision to the state building code after a study showed that women take longer in restrooms and are forced to wait in lines to use the facilities at sporting events and theaters. The study said women take more time because they frequently are accompanied by small children and because they wear more clothes than men. The State Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> voted Saturday to increase the required number of women's restrooms in public places by 50 percent, effective March 1. The provision will apply only to new construction of large public gathering places such as sports arenas and movie theaters. Men's and women's restrooms are currently required to be built in an even ratio. `` I'm pleased they made the change,'' <PERSON> Rollison </PERSON> said. `` I think this will open some new doors for women in the commonwealth.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian Jewish groups Monday began fighting a proposal that would accept only Orthodox conversions to Judaism and limit converts who can immigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Four <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> congressmen who met with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said adopting the so-called `` Who is a Jew'' amendment would hurt U.S.-Israeli relations. About 800 Israelis demonstrated against the amendment Monday as the newly elected parliament convened for the first time. `` Do n't divide our people,'' read their posters Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, told reporters the proposal `` would engender some strains which would not be healthy for the U.S.-Israeli relationship.'' His congressional delegation, organized by the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, was one of three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian Jewish groups lobbying in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against the amendment. It would give Orthodox rabbis exclusive authority to approve conversions to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. This means Jewish converts would be granted automatic Israeli citizenship under the `` Law of Return'' only if brought into the faith by Orthodox rabbis. <ORGANIZATION> Ultra-Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> political parties are demanding the change as a price for supporting either the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc or left-leaning Labor party. The 18 parliament seats they won in Nov. 1 elections may give them the power o choose who heads the next government. The amendment is fiercely opposed by Reform and Conservative Jews whose branches make up the majority of Jews in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` We are dealing with 5 million American Jews. This law would make them feel like second-class citizens,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, chairman of the trustees' board of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>, a major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish fund-raiser. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said after meeting <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> politicians that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not risk alienating <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jews. `` American Jews see <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as an extension of ourselves. If the law is imposed on us, we will wonder if we are welcome in the State of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters he assured the congressmen that his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would vote against the proposed change even though it involves only a few foreign converts and does not affect most of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Jews, who are Orthodox but non-observant. `` I believe it's not terribly important for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. `` But it's very meaningful to American Jewry.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> said American Jews wanting to affect policy should immigrate. `` If you want to change <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, -LRB- you -RRB- should come over here and fight through political channels,'' he told members of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>, returning from a weeklong trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, told a news conference American Jews were so angry he feared changing the law could permanently damage U.S.-Israel relations. Some have threatened to donate money to American Jewish causes or private Israeli charities instead of directly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said the controversy could also affect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's 3 billion dollars in annual foreign aid to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` If you do n't have a united Jewish community, it is very doubtful if on its own the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- administration will keep up the level of gifts,'' he warned. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, which narrowly defeated Labor but failed to win an absolute majority in the elections, has agreed to support the `` Who is a Jew'' legislation in exchange for the backing of four religious parties in a Likud-led government. But the American campaign, added to pressure from liberal Israelis, could prompt <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to join together in a coalition that would blunt the influence of ultra-Orthodox parties.

<TEXT>
 American Jewish leaders are suggesting that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appoint a Jew or other strong supporter of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to a top post in an administration they see as taking shape without a voice for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The appointment of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor of Lebanese descent who will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief-of-staff, concerned some Jewish leaders. And other appointments have not assuaged that concern, they indicated Monday. `` None of them come to their posts with a clear message of heartfelt identification with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security needs,'' said <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookbinder </PERSON>, formerly the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and still a leading lobbyist for Jewish and Israeli causes. `` None of this is meant to imply that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is anti-Israel,'' added <PERSON> Bookbinder </PERSON>, who campaigned on behalf of Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. American Jewish leaders consider the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, including Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the most pro-Israel administration ever. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran on a strong pro-Israel platform but was viewed in the past with suspicion by Jewish leaders for advocating an increase in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> oil prices and for supporting some arms sales to Arab nations. <PERSON> Bookbinder </PERSON> and others, who echoed his sentiments but declined to be named, suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appoint a Jewish or pro-Israel Cabinet member or <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador. Among the names mentioned were those of <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>, the arms negotiator, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schifter </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for human rights. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, a conservative <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat who campaigned for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, has also served Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> on civil and human rights projects. <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, a partner in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm, said he had not been contacted `` but I would be willing to hear what the president-elect has to say. I have great respect for him.'' Also mentioned by several Jewish leaders was <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, who served as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador during the first years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and is viewed as a staunch ally of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It does n't have to be a Jew, but we need someone who will make us feel better,'' <PERSON> Bookbinder </PERSON> said. Leaders of Jewish organizations are to meet Wednesday with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to voice their concerns about his record. `` We've never had an Arab-American as gatekeeper to the president,'' said one leader invited to the meeting. `` I think there's legitimate cause for concern.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, whose grandfather was Lebanese, drew the ire of American Jews as the only governor to decline to condemn a 1975 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that equates Zionism with racism. Standing at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s side during a news conference announcing his selection for the White House job, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said last week he had not wanted to involve his state in foreign affairs. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said he rejects the 1975 resolution and supports the pro-Israel platform of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which he helped write.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The emerging <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration includes prominent holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, but with one clear and important difference: The new team is tilted far more toward pragmatists than ideologues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> filled three more key positions Monday and his choices were sure to set off cries of anguish from the right. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> will remain attorney general and <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> will stay on as education secretary. Both men were late-comers to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and both replaced leading ideologues, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. The third <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> choice was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> to serve as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's put together an Eastern establishment Republican administration,'' said conservative activist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Viguerie </PERSON>. `` That's discouraging.'' High-profile jobs in the next administration are rapidly being filled, and only one <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> choice has drawn applause from conservatives _ Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> who will serve as White House chief of staff. The voting machines had hardly stopped humming with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 40-state Election Day victory when the president-elect made the most obvious choice for his new administration _ friend, adviser and campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> as secretary of state During his tenure as White House chief of staff <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> earned a reputation as a quintessential pragmatist, a savvy insider who repeatedly gave low priority to the initiatives of the more ideological elements in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Calls on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to fire <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> were always sure applause lines at conservative gatherings. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s deputy was <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. Quick to follow the Baker selection was that of another old <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> friend and adviser, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. He will remain treasury secretary. In fact, another characteristic of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointees is how many have long-standing ties to the president-elect. When <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was filling out his administration eight years ago, he was meeting many of the top officials for the first time. The same was true of Democrat <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1976. Not so with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. His relationships with the people he has appointed goes back many years. That should not be surprising, considering the years <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has served in governmental and party posts. The long resume he touted during the presidential campaign put him in close contact with other up-and-coming Republicans. No one ever described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as an ideologue and, clearly, the people he feels most comfortable with are as pragmatic as he. It's always tough to get the jump on a new president and name his Cabinet for him. But so far there have been no big surprises, no choices from other than the names subject to the most speculation. The names being mentioned for the remaining national security jobs are former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> for Defense and Brent Scowcroft for national security adviser or <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. Scowcroft was national security adviser to President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and is an establishment figure. One conservative favorite whose name is frequently mentioned for a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post is former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is most often mentioned as either Labor or Housing secretary, the two areas where he is least-stringently ideological. The former <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> congressman has always enjoyed good relations with traditionally Democratic unions and his major urban initiative is a proposal for enterprise zones to encourage businesses to locate in neighborhoods with high unemployment. Neither post would make <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> a major player in areas where his more ideological views on monetary and tax policy would have influence. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may yet come up with some appointees who will please hard-line conservatives, but there is no sign of a <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> or a <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> waiting in the wings.

<HEAD>Malaysia Closing Down Vietnamese Refugee Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> will close a major camp for Vietnamese boat people and will turn away all new arrivals, the foreign minister said Monday. The government would announce the date once it finalized details to shut down <PERSON> Pulau </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidong </PERSON> island camp, said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>. `` The island will be gazetted -LRB- declared -RRB- a prohibited area and refugees arriving in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> after that date will be turned away,'' he said after opening the <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminar </ORGANIZATION> on Refugees and Displaced Persons. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> said rejecting the boat people formed the first phase of the government's decision to close the camp, which now houses about 12,900 refugees. The second phase, he said, was the final closure once all refugees had been repatriated to their own country or resettled in willing third countries. <PERSON> Pulau </PERSON> <PERSON> Bidong </PERSON>, an island 180 miles from <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION> on the east coast of <LOCATION> Peninsular </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, was turned into a refugee center after the 1975 communist victory in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, when thousands of Vietnamese fled to the shores of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and other Southeast Asian countries. The government has spent about $ 26.23 million to maintain the camp, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> said. Addressing the seminar, he said <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> was not prepared to open its doors to the boat people because they had abused the temporary asylum provided them. He did not elaborate. He said more refugees had come to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> between January and September this year than throughout last year. There were 1,008 arrivals last month, he said. `` Until the principle of first asylum is correctly addressed by the international community, the phenomena will one day be remembered as a problem rather than a solution,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> said. He called on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to prevent the illegal departure of its people and to accept the return of those not selected for final resettlement in third countries.

<HEAD>Panel Urges Bush To Kill Weapons System To Cut Defense Budget</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should cancel some weapons and look for other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> savings as part of the effort to control the defense budget, a congressional agency said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, in one of a series of reports on issues facing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he takes office Jan. 20, noted that even though `` each of the services says it needs many billions of dollars more to complete its modernization and expansion programs,'' the current $ 300 billion defense budget is n't likely to be increased for the forseeable future. Current Pentagon plans include programs `` which would cost about $ 200 billion more than the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> can expect to receive'' during the five-year period which ends in 1992, the congressional watchdog agency said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> need to take a number of actions to reduce future defense expenditures, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Those include: _ Reducing and realigning planned programs `` In so doing, cancel marginal systems and delay systems not ready for production.'' It did not give examples. _ Seeking common missions `` In the past, for example, we have developed a variety of systems _ land-based to aircraft _ to attack tanks.'' _ Carefully assessing the long-term impact of planned weapons The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that recalling four World War II battleships from <LOCATION> mothballs </LOCATION> was cheaper than building four new warships, but operating three of the ships will cost $ 150 million this year and require about 4,600 personnel. _ Rethinking <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s far-flung network of worldwide commitments `` The rising costs of our worldwide commitments, in the absence of increased burden-sharing by our allies, may simply be unaffordable.'' The new administration also needs to take steps to try to end the series of weapons purchasing scandals and high prices for spare parts. One improvement would be in the Pentagon office which oversees what is supposed to be the realistic testing of weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The usefulness of the current testing system `` has been limited because of insufficient resources to conduct testing, deferrel of certain critical tests until after the production decision, failure to simulate realistic battlefield conditions during testing and acceptance of products which do not meet the test criteria,'' it said.

 A computer chip maker has adopted a strict no-smoking policy in its <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> plants in a policy shift that some predict will sweep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor industry. The new rules, which take effect Jan. 2, apply to all <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> employees of <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ 2,200 in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and 900 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. `` It's kind of a pilot project in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frink </PERSON>, a local spokesman for the California-based company. The company plans to remove ash trays and cigarette machines and has encouraged workers to join smoking cessation classes, designed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Employees previously were allowed to smoke in designated areas, although never in the `` clean rooms'' where delicate computer chips are made. <PERSON> Frink </PERSON> said the company revised its smoking policy to eliminate a potential source of chip-destroying contaminants. A speck of dust or smoke particle can block part of a microscopic circuit and ruin a chip.

 Twenty-five <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> first-graders were told Monday that they will be assured of money for college if they finish high school, and they declared: `` We are the happiest children in the world.''

The program, underwritten by the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, will provide the 25 children here and an additional 225 in nine other cities full college tuition or cash incentives if they do n't drop out.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s three holdover Cabinet appointees wo n't face a second round of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings thanks to a ruling 60 years ago on then-Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> to stay in their jobs in his new administration. All three men have joined the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration since August, and all experienced no problems being confirmed by a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s legal counsel, said they would n't have to undergo the confirmation process next year _ unless <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted them to If he did, the men would formally resign, only to be re-nominated by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. That wo n't happen, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition aides said. `` We're following the precedent that we think was wisely ... followed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>, who did not submit his nominees that were held over for reconfirmation,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, co-director of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition office. Since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>'s time there have been cases of Cabinet appointees remaining in office over the span of more than one president, according to <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s legal counsel. For example, Secretary of State <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> served both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> without separate confirmation hearings, he said. But the practice was tested in 1929 when a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> panel investigated the case of <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> financier who was treasury secretary in the <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coolidge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> administrations, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. `` This was undertaken in the case of <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> but it is applicable to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>,'' he said. Six decades ago, the senators concluded <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> appointees need not face additional <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation rounds because there was no statute limiting their terms, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- were of the opinion such officials could remain in office indefinitely,'' he said, at the pleasure of the president. If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wanted to require new confirmation hearings on holdover appointments at the end of an administration, it would have to pass a law on that subject, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. Two days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was elected on Nov. 8, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered all his appointees to submit their resignations in a timely fashion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to name the holdover Cabinet people obviously signals that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will not accept resignations from <LOCATION> Thornburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Education Department.

 A computer chip maker has adopted a strict no-smoking policy in its <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> plants in a policy shift that some predict will sweep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> semiconductor industry.

<TEXT>
 Women are starting to smoke earlier in life, smoking more and inhaling more deeply than they did in the 1960s, according to surveys by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The incidence of lung cancer in women increased five-fold during that time, from an average of 24 cases per 100,000 women in 1960-1964 to 131 per 100,000 between 1982 and 1986, the cancer society said. The number of women who smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day climbed by 20 percent between 1960-1964 _ when the cancer society conducted its first Cancer Prevention Survey _ and 1982-1986, when it conducted the Cancer Prevention Survey II. The results of the latest survey, in which 619,225 women were given questionnaires, appear in the Dec. 1 issue of the scientific journal <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. The survey also found that more women have quit smoking, and that there is actually a drop in smoking rates in women under age 45. `` If trends continue, this will be followed by a similar downtrend in women's lung cancer rates,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON>, one of the authors of the study.

<TEXT>
 Nine states filed a new lawsuit Monday against the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in their 5-year legal effort to force the agency to order new acid rain controls in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The states, joined by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, asked the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> to review <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to act on their petition seeking those controls. That petition called on <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to publish for public comment the determination of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> chief that sulfur dioxide emissions from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were harming <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Such a publication is the first step in drafting a regulation. The Canadian province of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and two environmental organizations filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on Nov. 1. A few days before leaving office in January 1981, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Costle </PERSON> wrote Secretary of State <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> that these emissions were harming <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by being transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid, which falls as acid rain in eastern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Many of these sulfur dioxide emissions originate in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> in power plant and factory smokestacks. Once such a determination is made, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law requires <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to order affected states to revise their air pollution control plans to eliminate the offending emissions. But the appeals court, in a decision upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, ruled earlier that a letter to the secretary of state was not formal enough, and any such determination had to be made in formal proceedings leading to a regulation. <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, the nine states and various environmental groups all petitioned for such formal proceedings, but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in October said it would not act on those petitions because it still did not know enough to tell states in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> how to revise their air pollution control measures. Environmentalists say acid rain has made hundreds of lakes in the <LOCATION> Adirondack </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> unlivable for fish. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> says 14,000 lakes in the eastern half of that country have been damaged. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooley </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, one of the plaintiff states, said in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the states are entitled to sue because they are harmed by the same pollutant harming <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He said he has asked that his lawsuit be consolidated with <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>'s. In addition to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the plaintiff states are the six <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>.

The president-elect said Monday, `` I will keep my commitment to bring in lots of new faces.'' Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, named as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new chief of staff last week, said at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governors conference in Point Clear, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, `` I think the next thing you'll see, probably after Thanksgiving, is the focus shift a little bit to the defense side, a little rounding out of that team, and then rounding out of some of the other major areas.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> swore in <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, 61, the first Hispanic-American to serve in a Cabinet, in September as successor to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had promised to appoint a Hispanic to his own Cabinet if elected. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 56, former governor of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and onetime head of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, replaced the embattled <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in August. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s priority as the nation's chief law enforcement officer will be `` combatting the scourge of drugs.'' `` Drugs are Public Enemy No. 1. A major part of <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>'s mission will be to stop them from damaging our society and our country,'' said the president-elect. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, 45, was deputy White House chief of staff and then deputy treasury secretary under <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> before taking a job with an investment firm last year. He has worked in six Cabinet agencies: <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, Education and Welfare. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also got some private advice Monday from former Presidents <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, who headed a commission that has made recommendations for the next administration. He later telephoned the man he defeated in the Nov. 8 election, Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said the two men spoke briefly about getting together but no date was set. `` I do n't want to have a lot of show business. I want to hold out my hand and say, ` Look, the campaign is behind us,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a brief news conference following his appointment announcements. At the news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rejected a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report that dismissed his `` flexible freeze'' proposal for cutting the budget deficit. The report said that tax increases as well as military and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> cuts would have to be considered. `` I'm not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit down,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I do n't remember any Republicans or Democrats running on a please-raise-my-taxes program.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, named to take over at the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, defended the flexible freeze, saying only Social Security was exempt from its stringencies. He singled out medical programs as a prime target for savings in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. He said medical costs have been rising at two to three times the general rate of inflation for a couple of decades. `` Just getting the costs in that area under control is a big challenge, but it's also a big reward in terms of budget savings,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that in proscribing new taxes and exempting Social Security from cuts, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> was administering `` just another dose of politics, of ` read my lips' and other absolutist statements ... They are not going to work.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Tuesday for two hours of meetings with President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, who takes office Dec. 1. The vice president will stop on the way in Point Clear, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, at a Republican governors conference. He said he would make clear in his meeting with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> `` that I am committed to democracy in Central America.'' He said the Sandinista government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has been `` unwilling to take the steps towards democracy that I find absolutely essential if we are going to have harmony in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also was asked Monday about his meeting next month with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He said he would not make any commitments on `` arms control or anything else'' when he sees <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. It will be `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting. I will be there as vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I expect they'll be aware they're talking to the next president,'' he said. As for his appointees, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had spelled out for both <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> `` certain objectives,'' and would `` work in a hands-on fashion with the members of the Cabinet after I am sworn in.'' On the budget, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> `` understands the numbers'' and `` will make sure the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hits the ground running'' in trying to reduce the federal deficit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has not decided whether he will send <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after his inauguration a complete revision of the fiscal 1990 budget that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will submit in January as one of his last acts.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> and Mexican trackers threaded their way across 400-foot cliffs Monday looking for clues left by snipers who shot at a <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> rafting party and killed a man trying to drag his wounded wife to safety. Up to four snipers were believed responsible for the Saturday ambush on the river in which the couple's river guide also was wounded. He and the woman were hospitalized in stable condition Monday. `` The woman said she remembered seeing some smoke coming from the high bluff on the Mexican side of the river ... and that moments later, shots were fired and bullets hit on either side of their raft,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` The woman says it was a nightmare. `` There was no provocation or anything. It was just an attack.'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said it was the second time this year that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tourists have reported being shot at from the cliffs on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s side of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. Officials believe between 20 and 30 shots were fired, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. Searchers found 12 shell casings Sunday on the cliffs in an area reachable only by boat or helicopter and once notorious for its marijuana cultivation. The three were rafting down the river outside Big Bend National Park in southwestern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> when they were fired at about noon Saturday. Guide <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> had led <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Eastland </LOCATION>, down two miles of their planned 12-mile trip in the rented 14-foot inflatable raft when the shooting began. Mrs. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON> thought at least two people were on the bluff but <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> said he saw four, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> was shot in the right thigh, but was able to maneuver the raft ashore. When the gunfire continued, he and the Heffleys moved downriver. After they pulled ashore again, Mrs. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON> was shot when they got out of the raft, authorities said. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON>, 40, was shot in the back and killed while he tried to help his wife to safety, <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> hid in brush, and <PERSON> Burr </PERSON> set out for help after dark, authorities said. He was spotted by a rancher Sunday morning. When the three failed to arrive at a pickup point Saturday night, the rafting company sent another raft to look for them. The rescue crew found the raft and other equipment with numerous bullet holes, and contacted authorities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Border Patrol and Customs helicopters were sent out early Sunday and their crews spotted <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON>'s body near the river after daybreak, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. When the helicopters landed, Mrs. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON> came out of brush where she had been hiding, he added. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, co-owner of Far Flung Adventures, said the trio had started their trip at <LOCATION> Rancherias </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and were supposed to have gone on to <ORGANIZATION> Grassy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a 12-mile trip by river but 40 miles by road. The attack occurred in a canyon at a point where the river is 50 to 60 yards wide, he said. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON> was a sales manager for <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> X-Ray, owned by <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chickasha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> said he and wife, <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON>, were supposed to join the Heffleys for the trip to Big Bend `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> had gone down a couple of weeks ago. He thought it was such a beautiful area,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> said. `` He had taken a motorcycle trip for a chili cookoff. He thought it was such a pretty area that he wanted <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> to see it.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Heffley </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, 36, were hospitalized in stable condition in Alpine, 80 miles from the shooting scene.

<HEAD>Health, Economics Issues in Kentucky Smoking Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK R. CHELLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, the nation's leading tobacco producer, are pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> to drop its plan to restrict smoking, days after a government report showed the state had the nation's highest smoking-related death rate. The chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agriculture committee said Monday that the controversy over designated non-smoking areas at the university is about economics and individual rights, not about health. But supporters of segregating smokers said that health is the overriding concern and that they are not enemies of the tobacco industry in a state where it accounts for an estimated 54,000 jobs and where burley tobacco is the No. 1 cash crop with $ 451 million in sales last year. The dispute grew out of the university's consideration of a policy to ban smoking in classrooms, reception areas and elevators and to permit smoking only in designated areas of most other buildings. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reacted by threatening to cut the university's budget. `` I do n't think we're fighting for the tobacco industry, or the tobacco farmer. We're talking about people's rights here,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Crupper </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Crupper </PERSON> said it sends a bad signal to the rest of the country when <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> joins the list of places where tobacco is under attack. At a meeting in <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION> late Sunday, <PERSON> Crupper </PERSON> first called on the task-force members to approve a resolution asking the university to back down. But he later agreed to give the university until the task force's Dec. 5 meeting to revise its policy. A newly released report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> shows <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> with the nation's highest smoking-related death rate. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> reported 176 smoking-related deaths for every 100,000 residents in 1985, the agency reported Thursday. Nationwide, smoking killed 314,574 Americans that year. Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> `` Butch'' <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON>, a smoker and promoter of the tobacco industry, said the state university's proposed smoking policy was a slap at the farmers and companies that pay taxes on their tobacco business `` I personally believe that since we are such a large tobacco state, it is a mistake for a school like <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> to do that because so many of their tax dollars come from it,'' <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, special assistant to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>'s president, said the school expected some backlash when it began considering the policy, but is trying to balance health concerns and individual rights. `` Given the history and the fact that tobacco has played an important role in the history of the commonwealth, we expected there would be some reaction to it,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` This is not an anti-smoking policy. This is not an anti-tobacco policy.'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Signup for Wheat, Feed Grain, Cotton Programs Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers who want to participate in the government's 1989 programs for wheat, feed grain and upland cotton can sign up Dec. 19 through April 14 at county offices, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> announced Monday. The signup dates for 1989 rice and extra-long staple cotton programs will be announced later, he said. Farmers also will be able to `` declare their intentions'' from Dec. 19 through Feb. 3 to plant 10 percent to 25 percent of each program crop's permitted acreage to soybeans or sunflowers and still protect the acreage base history for the program crops, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. In addition, the 1989 program allows a portion of a farm's acreage base to be used for oats, with certain stipulations affecting soybeans During the signup, wheat and feed grains producers may request 40 percent and upland cotton and rice producers 30 percent of their estimated 1989 deficiency payments. These preliminary payments will be in cash. Deficiency payments are direct subsidies made to farmers to help bridge the gap between lower market prices and `` target'' prices set for each commodity. For wheat and feed grains, farmers will be able to participate in an optional acreage `` diversion'' or land-idling program called 0-92. Under it, a farmer can devote all or part of his crop's permitted acreage to soil-conserving uses and get deficiency payments on up to 92 percent of the land <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and upland cotton farmers will be able to participate in a 50-92 version.

 Jury selection began Monday in the trial of two people charged with bilking 31,000 lonely men out of more than $ 4 million by promising them a paradise called Chonda-Za filled with naked women. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON>, 59, of <LOCATION> Bettendorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Pamala </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who operated the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Love </ORGANIZATION>, are charged with multiple counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy and unlawful use of fraud proceeds. Prosecutors contend letters were sent to prospective male members telling them of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Love </ORGANIZATION>, which they said was founded in 1965 by a teen-age Mexican girl named <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Simona </PERSON> <PERSON> Mireles </PERSON>.

Men who sent donations received personalized love letters, racy audio casettes and photos of naked women identified as members of the secret sect, prosecutors said. Prosecutors contend the paradise never existed and that money they solicited was funneled to the personal use of the church's founders and their employees Defense attorneys say the organization was nothing more than a lonely hearts club that provided fantasies for shy men. Indictments issued in December charged that <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, under the guise of their <ORGANIZATION> COL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, mailed letters to the men, asking them to send between $ 20 and $ 30 for a membership fee.

 Searching on the ground and from the air has turned up no trace of a 9-year-old girl or her acne-scarred kidnapper, but the youngster's mother said Monday she was sure her daughter was safe. `` We need for people to keep an eye out,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON>. `` The police have got a lot of leads. We're really hopeful. I honesty believe that she's okay. Nobody can hide forever.'' Nine-year-old <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> went to the market Saturday with a girlfriend, and when they left the store her scooter was gone. A man with an acne-scarred face told the fourth-grader her he knew where it was, then grabbed her and drove away with her while she screamed for help. Scores of volunteers have distributed thousands of fliers since then in the effort to find the missing girl. `` I'm kind of living on nerves. I'm keeping busy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON>, who has three other children. She said it is easier to cope `` if you focus on the process of the search and getting her back, instead of focusing on her being missing. `` As my mother said, you really do n't have any choice.'' Police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators have searched the hills and parks of southern <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> with helicopters and airplanes. They also released a composite sketch of the suspect based on the description given by <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON>'s companion. Police refused Monday to disclose any leads they may have, but Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said the only firm lead investigators have to go on is fingerprints taken from the recovered scooter. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON> spent the day working on a new flier with an updated photo of his eldest daughter, described as polite and friendly. Mrs. <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON> refuses to leave home because she's afraid <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> will call while she's gone. <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 8, had ridden scooters to the market to buy soda and candy. When they emerged, <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON>'s red scooter, which she had borrowed from <PERSON> Trina </PERSON>'s brother, was missing. <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> told police that while <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> was looking for her scooter, a man with dirty-blond, shoulder-length hair beckoned to her and told her it was by his car. When she went to retrieve the scooter, <PERSON> Trina </PERSON> said, the man grabbed <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> by the waist, forced her into his car and drove away on a heavily traveled boulevard. The Garechts received support from the parents of 8-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia, who disappeared from <LOCATION> Pinole </LOCATION> on June 3, and the parents of 10-year-old <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who vanished nearly five years ago in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kevin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> _ an organization he founded to help others after his own son was kidnapped _ said a couple of things make <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON>'s case unique. `` On the positive side is having the composite, something police can get their hands on,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who spent Monday helping to coordinate fliers at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lorenzo </LOCATION> print shop. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said finding fingerprints at the abduction site is also unusual and that most abductors are `` far more subtle.''

Under the rules, the borrowers will have 45 days to reply to FmHA with information on how they intend to repay, refinance or restructure overdue loans totaling more than $ 8 billion. <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said the notices, scheduled for mailing Nov. 14-25, put the 45-day deadline just after the first of next year. Borrowers who fail to respond in time, or whose proposals are rejected, face foreclosure by <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` These notices include over 200 pages of complex regulations,'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said. `` I feel the farmers should be given sufficient time to analyze the regulations and compile the necessary information to fill out the forms corrently.'' <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Aycock </PERSON> said he did not know of any plan by the agency to extend the 45-day period. `` Not at this point,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A transport strike stranded thousands of people and forced schools in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> to close Monday, when President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> marked her first 1,000 days in office by promising economic revival. The military <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said service on about 80 percent of the 445 passenger jeep routes in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> was disrupted by a strike called by drivers demanding lower prices for spare parts. It also affected about half the jeep routes in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest metropolitan area 350 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Officials said drivers in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> walked out when they heard of the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> strike. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she had been trying to get prices reduced and would meet with strikers and spare parts dealers Tuesday in search of a compromise. No serious violence was reported in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> but police arrested 15 drivers. Among them was <PERSON> Medardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Roda </PERSON>, leader of the militant jeep driver's association PISTON, which led the walkout. The union demanded price reductions after a presidential decree last week that dropped the minimum fare to about 3 cents for a 2 -LCB- - mile ride The old rate was about 4 cents, but the drivers actually charge about 5 cents. Twenty-six military trucks and buses picked up stranded commuters during <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s evening rush hour Monday. The government-owned Light Rail Transit system, not affected by the strike, reported a 66 percent increase in riders and extended its operating hours. Police said the 15 strikers were arrested in various parts of metropolitan <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for allegedly forcing some drivers to join the protest. <PERSON> Roda </PERSON> was arrested outside the main post office after leaving a news conference. Police said he may face charges of inciting to sedition for saying in a broadcast interview he would `` fight the government to the last.'' A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> May </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a labor confederation to which PISTON belongs, accused the government of `` repressive measures in responding to the legitimate struggles and legitimate demands of our people.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters she had asked spare parts dealers to cut prices and was `` really disappointed'' that drivers went ahead with the strike. Monday was her 1,000 th day in the presidency she assumed Feb. 25, 1986, as the result of a civilian-military uprising that forced President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to flee to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> In a televised speech Monday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said her administration had restored democratic institutions and she would make economic progress the priority of her final years in office. She set a goal of 6.5 percent annual growth through the end of her term in 1992 and pledged to create a million new jobs each year. She said blamed right-wing opponents for the slow pace of social reform, which critics cite as a shortcoming of her government. Military dissidents have attempted six coups, the most recently in August 1987. `` The military rebels succeeded in all but destroying the faith and confidence of the world in our country,'' she said. Also on Monday, military spokesmen said the army had released 17 human rights activists, including a Dutch woman social worker, after 15 hours of detention in <LOCATION> Piat </LOCATION>, 220 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The activists had spent five days investigating rights violations in the area and were freed without charges, said Capt. <PERSON> Eufracio </PERSON> <PERSON> Villegas </PERSON>, army commander in <LOCATION> Cagayan </LOCATION> province. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> made little mention of plans for safeguarding human rights and fighting communist and Moslem insurgencies. She said a 60-day nationwide cease-fire with the communists, which expired in February 1987, had split rebel leadership and the rebellion was losing support. `` Our policy of reconciliation first, and force when it fails, has brought down the strength of the insurgency considerably,'' she said. Reaction to the speech was mixed. Sen. <PERSON> Aquilino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON>, who supports the president, said: `` The insurgency is still active, poverty is still to be eradicated, public corruption is still to be curtailed. The debilitating foreign debt is still to be tackled and foreign domination of many aspects of Philippine society is still a fact of life. <PERSON> Wilfrido </PERSON> <PERSON> Villacorta </PERSON>, a university professor and member of a commission that drafted the new constitution, said he was disappointed by the slight mention of human rights. `` The leadership still perceives itself as a mere facilitator of transition rather than a trail-blazing harbinger of social change.'' Task Force Detainees, an organization supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said 660 people were slain for political motives from March 1986 thorugh June.

<HEAD>Carter, Ford to Bush: Cut Spending, Raise Excise Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said in a report Monday that the federal budget deficit, the No. 1 problem facing President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, could be reduced by cutting spending and raising taxes on motor fuel, beer, wine and cigarettes. The ex-presidents said they went over the report with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, though they would n't give details of their meeting with him at the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. They said he listened to them attentively. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says his economics team will move swiftly to tackle deficits once he takes office Jan. 20, he has promised not to raise taxes. Asked by reporters about the report's proposal to increase excise taxes, he replied the ex-presidents `` did n't mention that to me.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> were the co-chairmen of a bipartisan group that wrote the report, entitled `` American Agenda.'' Some 340 experts, including former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>, contributed to what <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> called `` a full platter of recommendations.'' During the presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> occasionally derided the most recent Democratic administration, presided over by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Monday he felt no bitterness toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or other Republicans. `` Now is a time of healing,'' he said, adding that both he and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had offered to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deal with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in implementing programs that would serve the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The budget deficit, which reached about $ 155 billion this year, was given priority in the report. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said people at home and abroad are `` vociferous in demanding'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` spell out a program on how the deficit is going to be reduced.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> contended there was `` no practical way'' to balance a budget by 1993 solely with spending cuts. Revenues must also be raised, he said. He defended the idea of a stiffer tax on cigarettes, which he said are a leading cause of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The report suggests <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agree to a $ 40 billion annual reduction in the deficit as long as there is no recession. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to develop a bipartisan budget agreement covering two or four years until the budget is balanced in the mid-1990s, it says. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could take a number of steps to balance the budget, the report says. They include freezing defense spending at current levels adjusted for inflation, holding <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> cost-of-living increases to 2 percent less than the Consumer Price Index, reducing <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> fees for doctors as well as trimming agriculture price supports and public works and transportation appropriations, while increasing taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, beer and wine. The report's other priorities, in descending order after the budget deficit, are national security and arms control, the savings and loan crisis, Third World debt and international trade, the fate of children at risk and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with allies. The ex-presidents said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s second tier of priorities _ issues of compelling and intrinsic importance but not requiring immediate action _ should be productivity and education; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; the environment and drugs. On national security, the report suggests that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continue research on Star Wars. The two former presidents said, however, that they do not believe a total missile defense shield is possible. They also recommend continuing talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on reducing conventional and strategic weapons. Other key issues dealt with in the report are: _ The savings and loan crisis: <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> recommend working out a plan with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion to pay off depositors in insolvent thrifts, as well as reforming the insurance fund <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> called the savings and lone crisis `` one of the most serious facing the administration.'' _ International trade and Third World debt: The report proposes upgrading the position of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative and making early threats of retaliation against blatantly unfair trade practices It also suggests strengthening dispute mechanisms in multilateral trade pacts. _ Children at risk: The report advocates more federal aid for programs that help poor children, such as Head Start, prenatal care and feeding programs _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> relations with the allies: The report says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should reassure allies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitments will be kept and that stability and progress on arms control policy will be maintained.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should make vigorous use of new powers that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has given the president to get satisfaction from other countries in trade disputes, a congressional investigative agency said Monday. In one of a series of reports on important issues for the transition to the new presidency, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it has found many instances when a follow-up was needed to get the benefits of an international trade agreement. It added that delaying tactics and slow dispute settlements have often frustrated efforts to get satisfaction, but the new Trade Act strengthens the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hand. `` Failure to gain timely satisfaction can now trigger a unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` The new administration should show strong resolve to vigorously use these new powers.'' One provision of the trade law <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed in August permits him to specify what he considers high-priority unfair trade practices and to start action toward retaliation while trying to get a settlement by negotiation. Another provision permits him to rule that a country denying internationally recognized rights to labor can be considered as engaging in an unfair trade practice, and to retaliate against its trade. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> complained of defects in efforts to promote exports. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has chosen questionable trade promotion events and has been active in countries with little or no potential for buying more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. It did not specify the nations. It characterized as `` largely symbolic'' the controls put on exports to further foreign policy objectives, as distinct from controls that have security objectives. `` When these controls are symbolic, they do not prevent the targeted country from getting the controlled products from other countries,'' the report said. `` Instead their costs are borne by American businesses in the form of export sales lost to firms in other countries.'' The report did not specify either the countries targeted by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> controls or their suppliers. One nation to which exports are controlled for foreign policy reasons is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where Japanese and West European suppliers have replaced many exports that can now no longer be shipped by Americans.

<HEAD>12th Parliament Opens with Stormy Session</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 12th parliament opened Monday with fiery exchanges between political rivals and a plea from President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> to save the institution `` from the weakening of its foundations.'' Fifteen members initially refused to take the oath of office from a representative of the extreme right, dramatizing their opposition to his party's advocacy of expelling Arabs from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. About 1,000 Israelis, most of them teen-agers, demonstrated outside against demands by ultra-Orthodox religious parties that only conversions to Judaism by Orthodox rabbis be recognized. In the atmosphere of sharp division, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> continued seeking a broadly based coalition including the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. Labor and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc have been equal partners in a `` national unity'' coalition government since indecisive 1984 elections. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won 40 seats in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, in the Nov. 1 elections and Labor got 39. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has been negotiating with small religious and right-wing parties for a parliamentary majority, as well as offering Labor a junior partnership. Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> leades met Monday night for what could be a critical negotiating session, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Before the meeting, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> expressed pessimism about prospects for an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. `` In my estimation we are heading for the opposition benches,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as saying in an interview published Monday. Israeli media quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying `` the chances of forming a broad government are close to nil,'' but his spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said the question remained open. `` It's a war of nerves,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. `` Of course he would like as broad a government as possible, if it is possible. All options are open.'' Labor wants two of three important ministries: defense, finance and foreign affairs. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to give only one, preferably defense. In the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, leftist legislators from six parties refused to take the oath from <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinzak </PERSON>, 77, who as the oldest member was made chairman of the meeting in keeping with tradition. `` In my worst nightmare I never thought someone like you would swear me in as a member of parliament,'' dissenting legislator <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> shouted in protest. Three Arab members _ <PERSON> Tawfiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tawfiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Toubi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahab </PERSON> <PERSON> Daraushe </PERSON> _ refused the oath by saying they would swear only `` to fight against oppression and transfer.'' Transfer is the term <PERSON> Sprinzak </PERSON>'s Moledet party uses for expelling Arabs. The 15 protesting legislators later agreed to take the oath so they could vote for a <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> speaker. <PERSON> Sprinzak </PERSON>, whose late father <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> was the speaker of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s first parliament, was shouted down when he tried to explain his party's platform `` Our movement aims to protect our gains from the Six-Day war,'' <PERSON> Sprinzak </PERSON> said, referring to the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` We want to preserve the entire land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and prevent the relinquishing of any parts of it,'' he added. Finance Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissim </PERSON> was so angered by the spectacle that he mounted the podium, pounded his fist and declared: `` I've never seen such a mockery made of our parliament, before the eyes of our people, the whole world. <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, a survivor of the Nazi Holocaust, was elected speaker. <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON>, who presided, said at the ceremonial session: `` In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today one senses a gloomy atmosphere, an exaggerated sense of confusion and distress. We dare not take this -LRB- democracy -RRB- for granted. History has known many a democratic government that collapsed in time of crisis. We, too, are not immune to developments which may endanger this House.'' `` The test of your membership in this supreme body of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> democracy will be your readiness and capacity to protect it from the weakening of its foundations.''

 Insolvent savings and loans should be shut down as soon as possible, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Monday, criticizing the current policy of keeping troubled institutions alive with government rescues. `` The time has come to move as quickly as possible to close insolvent institutions,'' the congressional watchdog agency said in one of a series of transition reports addressed to the next administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` That means fully recognizing and finding the money to pay for the losses in those institutions _ money that <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- does not have today,'' it said. In another report, former presidents <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> called on President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to close all insolvent S & amp; Ls within two years. `` The current approach of merging or selling insolvent institutions ... defers but does not solve the problem,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said in their report, entitled `` American Agenda.'' The two former presidents said the industry must continue to pay for the cleanup of ailing institutions, but they acknowledged, `` the next president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- also -RRB- must go to the taxpayers.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said his agency's call for swiftly closing insolvent thrift institutions was an implicit criticism of the current <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> policy of rescuing failed thrifts by providing private investors with government cash and guarantees against future loss. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> was not against all mergers, but said so far the bank board has n't had the money to recognize all the losses and is covering them with open-ended guarantees. `` They're not really resolving the problem in the sense of putting it behind them,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> also said the problem was too large for the industry to bear alone and said the `` depositing public'' must help, either through an appropriation of tax dollars or some sort of user charge. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank board, said `` there are inherent dangers to local economies'' in closing too many institutions. Selling too much of the property from failed S & amp; Ls too fast would drag down the value of property held by healthy institutions, he said. `` There are places in the country where wholesale closings would result in no services to a community,'' he said. `` ... It would be devastating if we were to do wholesale liquidations in a state like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' The bank board has resolved 146 cases so far this year, but only 26 of them by closing an institution, he said. Both the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> and the former presidents recommended reforms to prevent a repeat of the S & amp; L mess, estimated to cost $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion to resolve. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> should be administratively merged with the fund for commercial banks under a common regulatory board, a move opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry. They called for unspecified reforms to the deposit insurance system. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> believed a fundamental reform of deposit insurance was not needed immediately and could delay the resolution of the crisis, although it did recommend `` reconsidering the wisdom of the regulatory distinctions between thrift institutions and commercial banks.'' The agency suggested experimenting with several reforms. One, called risk-based deposit insurance, would charge higher premiums to banks that make risky investments. Another, known as a narrow bank proposal, would restrict <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to investing deposits in nearly risk-free areas such as government securities.

<HEAD>Environmental Group Says EPA Softened Stand On Landfills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An environmental organization said Monday it would seek a congressional investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s softening of an internal report on the status of pollution monitoring at hazardous waste landfills. The internal document found significant non-compliance with ground water monitoring requirements, but a report released publicly by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> last month painted a `` rosy picture,'' according to the Environmental Defense Fund. An <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official said the group's complaint was overstated and out of date. The fund released two documents, one the internal report of the agency's ground water monitoring task force submitted in 1987 and the other, published in October of this year, entitled `` Hazardous Waste Ground Water Task Force: 1987 Status Report and 1988-1989 Program Recommendations.'' The task force was formed in 1984 and disbanded in 1987. Originally assigned to investigate ground water montoring at 58 sites, it completed field work at 24 before turning over the task to other <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> offices. <PERSON> Kathie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, said the 1988 document `` waters down the findings and conclusions of the task force and paints an overly rosy picture in an effort to make the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people believe that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has the situation under control.'' After 1984 amendments tightened federal hazardous waste laws, only about 250 facilities decided to remain in operation. The 1987 document said that in the experience of the task force, `` the majority of monitoring well systems ... are not capable of immediately detecting or assessing a release from a disposal unit.'' That phrase did not appear at the corresponding point in the 1988 document. The later document, instead, contained this phrase: `` All 24 facilities had some defects in either the construction or location of their monitoring wells.'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response, said `` a lot of things that were pointed out -LRB- in the internal report -RRB- were true, and what came out of this was a major uprgade'' of monitoring at hazardous waste facilities. But to claim that the internal report was watered down for public consumption, he said, `` Is a lot of nonsense. People get hold of interim draft reports and if they find one iota of difference, they charge whitewash. ... This was n't a draft, this was partial input. We did n't use all of it.''

<TEXT>
 At least 7,000 ethnic Albanians angered by the ouster of two leaders defied threats of a crackdown and took to the streets in heavy rain Monday, extending a wave of ethnic protest for a fifth straight day. The demonstrators marched about 40 miles to <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, capital of the restive southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. In the northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, about 13,000 people braved a snowstorm Monday to press for more democracy. The two protests were not related. The Slovenians called for a referendum on controversial constitutional changes and for acquittal of four men sentenced to jail for making public a classified military document. A rally in Revolution Square in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, the Slovenian capital, drew 10,000 people and another rally in <LOCATION> Celje </LOCATION>, 42 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION>, drew 3,000. Slovenian courts acted at the last minute Monday to postpone the scheduled jailing of the three journalists and one army officer, whose sentencing last summer led to protests and petitions in the most liberal of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> protesters were angered by the resignations Thursday of <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kacusa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON>, both ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> members of the province's 13-member ruling Politburo. The two stepped down under pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who wants greater control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> for its republic, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. He has demanded changes in the 1974 constitution that gave <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> broad autonomy. Provincial party leaders have promised to review the resignations of the two ethnic Albanians later this week. In a speech Monday in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> reiterated his demand for the constitutional changes he says are needed to protect <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Serb minority from harassment by ethnic Albanians. He made no reference to the weekend protests in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> by up to 100,000 ethnic Albanians. At Monday's protest in a <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> sports hall, a crowd of about 7,000, mostly workers who trudged 40 miles from the town of <LOCATION> Orohovac </LOCATION>, dispersed after a Serbian factory worker defied <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> and backed the ethnic Albanians. The worker, <PERSON> Ruzica </PERSON> <PERSON> Imsa </PERSON>, was cheered wildly as she spoke out against the constitutional reforms pressed by many of her fellow Serbs. `` The working class will not allow itself to be pushed around,'' she said. `` We will not let anyone impose constitutional changes the people do not want.'' Local Communist Party leaders were jeered and whistled when they tried to get the crowd to return home. They then persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Imsa </ORGANIZATION> to return to the microphone, and her calm appeal succeeded in dispersing the crowd. Later, another crowd of about 2,000 people arrived from the town of <LOCATION> Klina </LOCATION>, some 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. Officials had warned of a crackdown if protesters took to the streets. At an earlier gathering at <ORGANIZATION> Pristina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, acting provincial party head <PERSON> Remzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koljgeci </PERSON> told students `` unspecified measures'' would go into force if more protests occurred. Under a package of constitutional amendments due to be passed by each republic by next week, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> wants to restore Serbian control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s judiciary, education and policing. The amendments are designed to simplify the complex federal constitution and give the legal framework to introduce market-oriented economic reform. Most of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s address dwelt on the need for economic change and strongly attacked bureaucrats for opposing it. Communist leaders in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s other five republics see <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s campaign as a drive to increase the influence of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest republic, on the Yugoslav federation. But <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> claims the changes would only put <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> on an equal footing with other republics, which have no administrative provinces like <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the proposed reforms have run into opposition from intellectuals who fear greater central control of the republic's relatively liberal judiciary The rally in <LOCATION> Ljubljana </LOCATION> pressed demands for a referendum on the reforms, which intellectuals believe would be strongly opposed in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Oil Workers End Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tens of thousands of oil workers returned to work Monday, ending a 10-day strike that caused widespread shortages of cooking gas and heating oil. Unions meeting Sunday and Monday voted to accept a government offer of wage increases, said <PERSON> Lucio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimentel </PERSON>, spokesman for the Petrobras state oil monopoly. The strike by more than 50,000 petroleum workers paralyzed the nation's 11 refineries. In emergency bargaining during the weekend, the government offered strikers a 15 percent cost-of-living raise and a 4 percent raise tied to productivity. Oil workers earn about $ 300 a month, good pay by Brazilian standards. <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> also agreed not to punish strikers and to deduct only four days' pay from their checks. Strike leaders urged unions to accept the offer, although it fell short of the 26.6 percent raise they demanded. The government had suspended the cost-of-living raise last year when it decreed a 90-day price freeze. Officials said granting the raise would create more inflation, now at an annual rate of more than 1,000 percent. `` It was a great political victory, although economically it did n't attain what we wanted,'' <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> of the national strike command said in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. During the strike, the government was forced to import emergency shipments of diesel fuel, cooking gas and kerosene when stocks threatened to run out completely. Gas rationing was imposed in some parts of the country. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has suffered a recent wave of strikes caused by a sputtering economy under President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>. The strikers have included national park employees, doctors and nurses at government-run clinics, electricity workers, subway personnel, steelworkers and federal employees in at least 17 of 26 ministries.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, setting `` black outreach'' as a top goal for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s future, said Monday the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has formed a political base that could hold the White House for decades. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, tapped to be the new <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, told the nation's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governors that in the last three presidential races the party has laid claim to enough key states that it `` could and should win the presidency right on through the next century.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> spoke to the annual <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> along with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff-designate, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. The agenda also included two newly named <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Cabinet figures, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. The president-elect speaks Tuesday to the conference, which is being held at the Grand Hotel resort on Mobile Bay. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said that with the initial Cabinet announcements, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has begun forming its economic team. He said the next announcements probably will be after Thanksgiving, with `` the focus shifting to the defense side.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, reviewing the 1988 campaign and looking to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hopes for the future, said the party has `` an opportunity in the black community,'' which has been solidly Democratic. In the conference hall Monday, there were only a couple of blacks in the crowd of perhaps 400. `` Black outreach is a top priority,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said, along with `` Hispanic outreach.'' As for his own role, which has been viewed by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> critics as lowering the level of the presidential campaign, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said: `` I'm not going to try to be a national celebrity. I'm not going to try to be a statesman. That ai n't me.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> drew laughter from the Republican crowd when he referred to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Democratic foe, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I'm not going to say anything bad about them at this point I ca n't think of anything bad about them that I did n't say in the campaign,'' he said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s predecessor on the national <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committee, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>, said the Democrats' problem in 1988 was `` the wrong message with the wrong messenger.'' `` A tremendous political realignment has already taken place,'' he said. `` We have parity on the battlefield now.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, while contending that new taxes are not needed to deal with budget deficits, also defended the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategy in the campaign. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, he said, described it as a `` dirty campaign .... <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s definition of dirty is when our party struck back at one of the lowest campaigns that has ever been run against a man in my political memory.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, discussing the `` ` Republican revolution,'' said the party's advances have set the stage for what may be `` the most exciting 10 years'' of this century <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, saying his office will have a `` full agenda'' in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, devoted most of his comments to the battle against drugs. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> viewed the drug trade as `` public enemey No. 1'' and that the statehouses are in the `` front line'' of the fight. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also said there must be major change on the demand side of the drug problem to begin resolving it. He said programs in the nation's schools should `` make sense'' to young people about living a drug-free life. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, in a session on education, stressed the importance of addressing the dropout problem in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, a former governor who joined <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> in the forum, said programs should be kept simple and `` do n't always rely on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' Taking part in the conference sessions Monday were 20 of the nation's 23 Republican governors, along with two governors-elect. Republicans will occupy 22 statehouses next year when new governors are seated, for a net loss of one state.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday helped break ground for the library that will house his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> papers, saying he hoped historians and scholars would `` judge our efforts well.'' `` This is a most humbling moment for me,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who will relinquish the presidency to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in 60 days. `` The story that will be told inside the walls that are yet to be built here is the story not only of a presidency, but of a movement.'' The president and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to take part in the ceremonies for the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Presidential Library. The 153,000-square-foot, Spanish-style facility will be built on a 100-acre site about 45 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval to the site last summer, after the president viewed the sweeping, hilly area from a helicopter following a ground inspection by the first lady. The selection of the <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> site, about 70 miles southeast of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' ranch in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, came after planners of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> library were thwarted in an attempt to build it at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Appearing at the ceremony at the outset of a six-day Thanksgiving vacation at his ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> talked reflectively of his eight years as president. `` The journey has not been just my own,'' he said. `` It seems I have been guided by a force much larger than myself, a force made up of ideas and beliefs about what this country is and what it could be.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> takes credit for a resurgence of conservatism in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and much of the 1988 campaign rhetoric during the Republican primary season was about what man could best carry on the `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution.'' This sea-change was based on a fiscal policy at home aimed at stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation of business, and a resurgence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> international influence brought about principally by a major military buildup, projections of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> power in the Third World and warming, if unsteady, relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` What this library will house is the record of ideas and policies that have undergirded our accomplishments,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` There will be much to study here, much to discuss, much to mull over.'' `` This library will allow scholars of the future to cast their own judgments on these years, and I would not presume to predict the result of their researches,'' he said. `` But I have to believe that scholars of good will, upon examining the historical record that will be contained herein, will judge our efforts well.'' `` But as for us, at present we can only say this: We have done our best and we pray that it has been enough.'' The land for the library was donated by a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> development company, <PERSON> Blakeley-Schwartz </PERSON>. The selection sparked opposition by environmentalists initially because the site impinged on a greenbelt area protected from large-scale development by a decade-old, non-binding agreement among <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moorpark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>. The $ 45 million library will be constructed with donations to the private <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> library foundation. It will sit in an area of rolling hills covered with brush, beavertail cactus and wildflowers. Former Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told the audience that over 100,000 people have contributed toward the library's cost, but he did not say how much of the money has been raised. Arrayed on the platform next to the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> were several members of the board of trustees of the presidential library foundation, including former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, former National Security Adviser and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, former domestic policy adviser <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, and Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>. After his brief speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> walked about 30 feet up a knoll, and he and his wife, each wielding stainless steel shovels that glistened in the bright sun, turned the first shovelsful of dirt as more than 250 people applauded. The building will include underground storage, a museum and research materials depicting the administration and historical events during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. As the curtain draws on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, the first couple seems prepared for the transition back to private life. they will move into a luxurious home in the Bel Air section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in January _ an estate that they will lease from friends who acquired the property in their behalf. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said he plans to lecture often `` on the mashed potato circuit'' and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said she will remain active in the campaign against drug abuse.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Buses halted, some stores were closed and school attendance dropped Monday because of a general strike to protest policies of the military government. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>'s government said it `` noted with satisfaction'' business activity picked up Monday afternoon `` in spite of the multiple appeals which aimed at the paralysis of national life by an illegal strike.'' About one-third of the stores in downtown <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> were closed and most others opened late. Fewer street vendors than usual were working, traffic was down and schools were poorly attended. Police were stationed on street corners and soldiers guarded gas stations, but no violence was reported.

 A strike by editorial workers at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> was postponed Monday when the newspaper's management made a new contract proposal, a <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> official said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantl </PERSON>, director of labor relations for the newspaper, said a pay raise could be part of the offer, but that an agreement with the federal mediator prevented him from revealing details of the proposal. The proposal was taken to the union's executive committee, and <PERSON> Fantl </PERSON> said he expected a response later Monday. Union representatives were at a meeting at the Sun-Times and were unavailable for comment. As the strike deadline of 2:30 p.m. came and went, both sides said they were prepared for a walkout, which would be the first strike by editorial workers in the newspaper's 40-year history. `` The picket-line chants are all set and ready to go,'' union spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehmann </PERSON>, the newspaper's religion writer, said earlier in the day. Picket signs and leaflets were printed and waiting, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Soll </PERSON> said management did not want a strike, but was `` fully prepared to produce a paper'' using company executives, non-union editors and outside writers. At the rival <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, a 40-month-long printers strike could end this week following the strikers' overwhelming approval of a new three-year contract. But walkouts by mailers and pressmen at the newspaper continued. The strike deadline at the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> was set by <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 71, which represents 250 reporters, editors, photographers and support staff. The union has been working without a contract since June 1. <PERSON> Soll </PERSON> said company negotiators were willing to meet around the clock, and he hoped an agreement could be reached at the meeting, which began at 9 a.m. Monday. A federal mediator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigler </PERSON>, was working with negotiators, officials said. `` There seems to be much less anguish and much more hope'' than in previous days, <PERSON> Soll </PERSON> said after talks resumed. The guild has been seeking a 19.5 percent pay raise over three years. Prior to Monday, management had proposed a 3 percent salary cut for 18 months, followed by a restoration of current pay levels for the remainder of the three-year pact, guild unit chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. Starting reporters earn $ 625 weekly, going up to $ 895 for reporters with five years' experience. In addition, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said, differences remained over management proposals to cut night differential for workers by 40 percent and exempt eight senior editorial staffers from union jurisdiction. <PERSON> Soll </PERSON> said `` the paper is healthy financially'' but must control costs to remain competitive with the larger <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, which has an estimated circulation of 765,000 daily and 1.117 million Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>, whose circulation is estimated at 605,000 daily and 614,000 on Sunday, was purchased from media baron <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for $ 145 million in June 1986 by a group of investors led by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Adler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Shaykin </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, members of <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 16 </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Typographical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> voted 180-43 Sunday to approve the new pact and an $ 8.56 million settlement fund. Tribune President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumback </PERSON> has until Thursday to decide whether to sign the agreement. Under its terms, the 119 printers still on strike, down from 240 who walked out originally, would have the option of a buyout or a lifetime annuity, as well as receiving company-paid medical coverage. About 50 printers who went back to work under a 1986 unconditional offer to return can stay on at the paper under terms of the three-year contract, which includes pay increases, or they can accept a $ 30,000 cash buyout.

 A car bomb exploded Monday near a motorcade in which four senior leaders of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> group were riding in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, but the assassination attempt failed, police said. Two bodyguards and a pedestrian were slightly wounded, they said. No group claimed responsibility.

Police and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> _ or <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> _ said a remote-controlled van packed with 330 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> blew up about 450 feet from the 10-car motorcade carrying <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Subhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasralla </PERSON> and the party's chief spokesman, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>.

A <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> statement said the three leaders and their companions were returning to <LOCATION> Baalbek </LOCATION>, the party's stronghold in the valley, from a rally in <LOCATION> Riyak </LOCATION>. But police said the convoy only made a brief stop in <LOCATION> Riyak </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> was happy and enthusiastic in the days before she died suddenly. She planned to buy an apartment and may even have found romance, friends, relatives and news reports said Monday. Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, 37, who died Saturday of what an autopsy report described as acute pulmonary edema, was a frequent visitor to the Argentine capital. She was in the city for four days in late October and returned again on Nov. 9. Her visits were motivated by her close friendship with <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodero </PERSON>, members of a wealthy Argentine family that had long been associated with Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' late father, shipping tycoon <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>. That friendship may have extended to a romantic interest in Mrs. <PERSON> Dodero </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Tchomlekdjoglou </PERSON>, 43, <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> newspapers suggested Monday. Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> had rented a suite at the luxurious Alvear Palace Hotel, in the heart of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Recoleta </LOCATION>, one of city's most exclusive areas, filled with expensive restaurants, night spots and boutiques. Nevertheless, the heiress wanted to spend `` all the time she could'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Tortuguitas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, where the Doderos have a weekend home, said <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zavalia </ORGANIZATION>, public relations director for the hotel. `` She had even bought some running shoes to be able to run there,'' Miss <PERSON> Zavalia </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Razon </ORGANIZATION>. Miss <PERSON> Zavalia </PERSON> said she often chatted with Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, `` who insisted on being treated like just another guest.'' She described the heiress as `` a person who made decisions on the spur of the moment.'' `` The other day, for example, she decided to leave the country, but she must have changed her mind at least five times in the course of the day,'' Miss <PERSON> Zavalia </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tortuguitas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, 25 miles northwest of the city, is comprised of about 350 weekend homes owned by wealthy <PERSON> Argentines </PERSON> <PERSON> Annabella </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, a cousin, recalled that Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> attended a party at the club the night before her death and `` appeared to be feeling very well.'' The cousin told reporters that on the day of her death Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Dodero </PERSON> planned to go swimming in a pool and went to change shortly before 11 a.m.. Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> took overly long in emerging from the bathroom where she was changing Her friend went to look for her `` and found her lying on the bathroom floor,'' the cousin told reporters. A conflicting version was published Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Buenos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aires </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Clarin </PERSON>, which cited <PERSON> Dodero </PERSON> family attorney <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> as saying the heiress died in her sleep at the <LOCATION> Dodero </LOCATION> home. Family members discounted the possibility that Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> could have committed suicide. `` A happy person could never commit suicide and <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> was content and very happy,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>, an aunt, told reporters. `` She had no -LRB- apparent -RRB- health problems.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> told reporters that her niece planned to attend a party Saturday night given by members of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>' Greek community. `` <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> was in the best part of her life,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> also had made plans to attend a Sunday night birthday party for Greek Orthodox Archbishop <PERSON> Ganadius </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrysolakis </PERSON>, who presided over her funeral Mass on Sunday morning. The archbishop told reporters he spoke to Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> only last Wednesday. `` We chatted for a long while and shared a meal,'' <PERSON> Chrysolakis </PERSON> told the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION>. `` She told me she was very happy that a series of family problems she was going through had been resolved. She was enthusiastic. She was very happy.'' <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Revitis </PERSON>, the archbishop's secretary, told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivadavia </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> that Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> had `` appeared very enthusiastic'' and `` had been making plans to buy an apartment in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>'' with the apparent intention of moving to the city. She maintained homes in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moritz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The motive for her decision to buy a home, several <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> newspapers suggested, was Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> apparently had a romantic interest in <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Tchomlekdjoglou </PERSON>. The Doderos and Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON>' relatives were not immediately available to comment on published reports that a marriage was in the offing. Ms. <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> was married and divorced four times and had a 3-year-old daughter.

 A judge on Monday dismissed an inheritance claim by a woman who says her mother had a four-day love affair with <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and that she is his daughter. Aspiring singer <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> had filed the inheritance petition in <ORGANIZATION> Shelby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees Presley's will Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> ruled there was insufficient evidence to warrant further review of the claim.

 The aging state airplane that had to make an emergency landing with Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> aboard ran into problems again Monday when pilots decided not to take it up because they did n't like the way it was handling. <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> pilots had been planning to fly the <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulfstream </ORGANIZATION> G1 from an airport near <LOCATION> Mountoursville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, where it made the emergency landing Sunday, to an aviation company in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, said department spokesman R.W. <PERSON> Groneman </PERSON>. When the turboprop taxied onto the runway for takeoff, the pilots decided to return it to the hangar. `` They did n't feel comfortable taking it up,'' said <PERSON> Groneman </PERSON>, who could n't say what the pilots did n't like about the way the plane was functioning. The plane, the largest in the state's fleet, had been set to fly to <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance center, where the 22-year-old aircraft underwent a $ 628,000 overhaul in 1987. Earlier Monday, the craft had been inspected by two officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. She said she did n't know whether the federal inspectors had determined why the plane malfunctioned. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, speaking to reporters Monday, tried to play down the seriousness of Sunday's mishap and said regardless of the plane's fate, the state can not afford a replacement It would cost $ 12 million to $ 13 million to buy an airplane of comparable size to the 17-passenger G1. `` How could we -LRB- buy a new plane -RRB-, with all of the problems we have?'' said the governor, whose state is facing a deficit estimated at nearly $ 2 billion. `` You should ground the governor before you spend $ 13 million on a new plane,'' he said. When the plane had problems previously, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he would use smaller planes to travel within the state and take commercial flights on longer trips if it could n't be repaired. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> insisted that the plane remains basically sound, despite having to make three emergency landings in the past 16 months, twice with the governor on board. `` It's not a dramatic threat to anybody,'' he said. `` If it were, we would n't be on the plane. And if they tell me it's a dramatic threat, then I wo n't be on the plane.''

 A panel considering President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plans for change recommends curtailing the power of a new national council in response to accusations that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> concentrates too much power in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said Monday the commission of the Supreme Soviet recommended dropping language that gives the new <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies the power to reject laws adopted by legislatures of the 15 Soviet republics. The commission is reviewing constitutional amendments to be considered by the national parliament next week. Proposed amendments designed to reorganize the governing apparatus hve generated considerable opposition, particularly in the independence-minded <ORGANIZATION> Baltic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> republics </ORGANIZATION> but also in letters published by the Soviet press. In one manifestation of recent demands for more authonomy, thousands of Lithuanians chanting `` For shame!'' jammed the center of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, on Monday to protest their legislature's refusal to declare the republic's autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, residents said. The Supreme Soviet commission, in a Saturday meeting that was the subject of Pravda's report Monday, also suggested changing language that authorizes new council to decide the composition of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, its constituent republics and autonomus regions. A dispatch from <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Federation </LOCATION>, the largest republic, denounced the Estonian action as a contradiction of `` the basic principles of socialist federalism.'' As proposed by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership, the amendment empowers the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> to `` take decisions relative to the composition of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, the approval of the formation of new autonomous republics and autonomous regions in the composition of the union republics.'' According to Pravda, the commission suggested limiting the council to matters `` on the questions of national-state structure relative to the jurisdiction of the U.S.S.R.'' It said changes recommended by the commission were part of an effort to increase `` the development of the sovereign rights of the republics.'' Just how far those `` sovereign rights'' go is a subject of dispute between <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, one of the three Baltic republics, and central authorities in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Last week, the Estonian legislature adopted a declaration of sovereignty giving the republic veto power over Soviet laws and proclaiming once-independent <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s power in all matters except defense and foreign policy Although the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> commission sought to limit the power of the new council, it also condemned the Estonian legislature's action on grounds that giving laws of a republic authority over national statutes violates the 1977 Soviet Constitution The Presidium, the Supreme Soviet executive body, has said it will review <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s action and has summoned Estonian leaders to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to explain. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s initial personal reaction to developments in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> was mild. He said during a visits to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> such actions were an exercise of `` perestroika,'' his program to reform the political and economic system. Constitutional amendments proposed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have caused a furor in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and, and to a lesser degree in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, because they are seen as limiting the powers of the republics as the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> seek greater control over their own affairs. They are part of his political restructuring, which includes creation of a more powerful presidency and a full-time national legislature. In <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perestroika </ORGANIZATION> called a 10-minute protest at noon that a spokeswoman said halted traffic in the downtown area.

 Two African National <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members were convicted of treason Monday in connection with two mine explosions, and a Swazi co-defendant was found guilty of terrorism. <PERSON> Ebrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebrahim </PERSON>, a senior member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and a founding member of its military wing, was abducted from <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> in December 1986 and held in solitary confinement until May 1987, when he was charged with treason.

The trial had been controversial because of <PERSON> Ebrahim </PERSON>'s abduction from <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> by men he identified as South African police.

The investigation will cover Japanese acts, policies and and practices that may be barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> architectural, engineering and construction services, and consulting services related to them. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s statement said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will consult with the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and seek advice from business committees and the public. A finding of unfair practices could lead to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliation. Last year <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> opened construction on the huge <ORGANIZATION> Kansai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> to foreign bidders, after a long dispute on access for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. The airport will serve <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION>. The announcement of the investigation came as President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was advised to make vigorous use of the new powers that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has given the president to get satisfaction from other countries in trade disputes. The advice came from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which has prepared a series of brief reports on important issues for the transition to the new presidency, which begins on Jan. 20. A report on trade released Monday said the office had found many instances when a follow-up was needed to get the benefits of an international trade agreement. It added that delaying tactics and slow dispute settlements have often frustrated efforts to get satisfaction, but the new Trade Act strengthens the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hand. `` Failure to gain timely satisfaction can now trigger a unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response,'' the report said. `` The new administration should show strong resolve to vigorously use these new powers.'' The report was submitted by Comptroller General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, the head of the office, to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and to `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative designate.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not yet appointed a successor to <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who is expected to leave with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration, which goes out of office Jan. 20. The report does not specify which new powers it means. Other governments have said they were worried that the president now has additional power to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry against competiion. One new provision of the new law permits him to specify what he considers high priority unfair trade practises and to start action toward retaliation while trying to get a settlement by negotiation. Another provision permits him to rule that a country denying internationally recognized rights to labor can be considered as engaging in an unfair trade practice, and to retaliate against its trade. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> complained of defects in efforts to promote <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has chosen questionable trade promotion events and has been active in countries with little or no potential for buying more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. It did not specify the countries. It criticized as `` largely symbolic'' the controls put on exports to further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy objectives, as distinct from controls which have security objectives. `` When these controls are symbolic, they do not prevent the targeted country from getting the controlled products from other countries,'' the report said. `` Instead their costs are borne by American businesses in the form of export sales lost to firms in other countries.'' The report did not specify either the countries targeted by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> controls, or their suppliers. One country where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports are controlled because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where Japanese and west European suppliers have replaced many exports that can now no longer be shppied by Americans.

 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> appeared with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at a joint news conference on Monday and advised <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to be careful in its reaction to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s recognition of the newly proclaimed Palestinian state. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s remark came the day after Egyptian recognition and he entertained the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman at a state dinner and a three-hour session of separate and enlarged talks. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should be precise in its statements and should know that we also want peace,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said. `` All the people in the region, including the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> people, want peace.'' The news conference was carried by the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> was apparently responding to reported Israeli threats to delay an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from disputed <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to return <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew from <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> in 1982, but an international arbitration team ruled two months ago that the area belonged to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. An Israeli government official said in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Monday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 10-member Inner Cabinet will discuss <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s move at a session Wednesday and will debate such a possibility. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> was also referring to Israeli accusations that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> violated the U.S-brokered 1978 Camp David peace accords, which produced the first peace treaty between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> but failed to grant any sort of autonomy to the 1.5 million Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> flew into <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, on Monday and said he and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> will discuss a common approach to a <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace conference. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on Monday summoned Egyptian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON> and expressed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s regret over <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s recognition of the Palestinian state, a ministry official said. The official said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON> the move violated Israeli-Egyptian treaties that call for the final status of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to be negotiated in peace talks. <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON> told <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> that recognition did not violate <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s agreements with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he reported. Wearing his usual military fatigues and black checked scarf, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> spoke briefly to reporters at the airport before leaving with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> in a Mercedes Benz flying the Egyptian and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags. It was the first time in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flag flew on an official car, an honor normally reserved for heads of state and ambassadors. However, there were no red carpets, military bands or other trappings of a head of state's arrival. `` I am really happy to be here, especially after the declaration -LRB- of a Palestinian state -RRB- by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. `` I can brief my brothers, headed by President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, on the details of the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> and draw a common visualization of effective steps for the promotion of an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference.'' Since the Palestinian state was declared Nov. 15 in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has flown to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, back to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to drum up support for future peace moves. The Palestinian council declaration did not define the boundaries of its new state, but implied it meant the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The declaration said <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> would be the capital of the Palestinian state. Palestinian sources in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said Monday that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> ambassadors there to press the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to grant him a visa so he can address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The Israeli official in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Bassiouny </PERSON> told <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> at their 40-minute meeting that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> viewed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s conditional acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 242 as a recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> The resolution, adopted after the 1967 war, calls on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw from captured territory, but also asserts the right of all countries in the region to live in secure borders. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the third country which has diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to recognize the declared <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The others are <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>.

 An earthquake rocked the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION> archipelago in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> on Monday, damaging some buildings on the largest island, officials said. No injuries were reported. The earthquake measured 5.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, meaning a quake capable of causing considerable to severe damage, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geologic Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Portuguese government officials said the quake shook the islands of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Terceira </LOCATION> at 11:55 a.m. EST Ms. <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> said the quake struck at 3:56 p.m. local time -LRB- 11:56 a.m. EST -RRB- and was centered about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>. She said there were reports of minor damage and the temblor was felt over a wide area. Buildings were damaged in northern <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, largest of the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> chain's nine islands, but there were no reports of injuries, the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> reported.

Tremors also were felt on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Terceira </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an air base.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Winter storms stranded thousands of motorists on icy highways Monday and forced postponement of an important military ceremony because a French general could not get there. Ice-and-snow storms whipped across many sections of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, bringing rush-hour traffic to a halt on the high-speed autobahns and wreaking havoc with air traffic. Traffic snarls as long as 15 miles were reported on some highways, along with hundreds of minor accidents. In <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the first big snow of the season closed Alpine mountain passes, clogged roads and delayed air travel. Red Cross workers took hot tea to motorists caught in traffic jams in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Dozens of vehicles ran out of gas while waiting to move. A collision involving 15 trucks and a passenger car backed up traffic on an autobahn near <LOCATION> Ulm </LOCATION>. Police said one person was injured in the collision. Gen. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Forray </PERSON>, the French army chief of staff, was scheduled to meet his West German counterpart, Gen. <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ondarza </PERSON>, in the southern town of <LOCATION> Boeblingen </LOCATION> for an official ceremony marking formation of a joint French-German brigade. <PERSON> Forray </PERSON>'s plane could not land at <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> because of bad weather and the ceremony was postponed, with a new date not specified, German officers at <LOCATION> Boeblingen </LOCATION> said. Officials said 49 flights were canceled at <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> agreed last year to create a joint army brigade. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television said schools in <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> schools closed because of slippery roads. More than 4 inches of new snow was reported in parts of southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Snow blanketed eastern <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and the western <LOCATION> Jura </LOCATION> hills. <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> reported 6 to 8 inches and St. Gall 10 inches. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fluela </PERSON> passes were closed temporarily and the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gotthard </LOCATION> pass was shut for the winter, the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Touring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> said. Seven other passes were closed earlier this month. Snow blocked runways and hampered visibility at <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>'s international airport, delaying flights up to three hours, an airport spokesman said Police reported many highways blocked by auto accidents.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and his wife were indicted Monday on bribery, extortion and conspiracy charges in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> corruption scandal, accused among other things of accepting a diamond-and-emerald necklace from the company's founder. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 55, and his wife, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 48, were accused of extorting $ 76,000 in payments from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as well as a $ 20,000 interest-free loan from one-time <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. In addition, the <PERSON> Garcias </PERSON> were accused of taking $ 77,500 and the necklace from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON>, in 1985. None of the payments, the loan or the jewelry was reported on <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s congressional financial disclosure forms in 1984 and 1985, according to the seven-count indictment. Attorney <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Santurce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was accused of funneling $ 86,100 in <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> payments through his law office to Mrs. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> as `` consulting fees,'' passing on $ 76,000 and keeping $ 10,100 for himself. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, now out of business, was a tiny <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> machine shop that grew into a multimilion-dollar-a-year defense contractor through a <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> program that allowed minority-owned firms to obtain government contracts without competitive bidding. <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Garcias </ORGANIZATION> face a maxium penalty of up to 20 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines if convicted of extortion, the most serious charge. They all face maximum penalties of two to 15 years in prison on additional charges of conspiracy, bribe receiving and receipt of an illegal gratuity. They are to be arraigned Dec. 1. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> met with the governor of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in 1985, the indictment said, although the governor was not accused of any wrongdoing. The indictment charged that on Aug. 2, 1985, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> congressional office, and allegedly directed the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executive to make the $ 20,000 loan through <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s sister, the Rev. <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>. This was done, the indictment said, `` so that it would falsely appear that <PERSON> Aimee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, was the source of the loan.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cortese </PERSON> was pastor of the Cross Road Tabernacle. The loan was repaid in two $ 10,000 payments, the indictment said. Neither <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> nor his attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morvillo </PERSON>, was available for comment, but <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> issued a statement through spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Danvers </PERSON>. `` I am grateful that this period of trial by grand jury leaks is finally over,'' the statement said. `` I note that despite an investigation which has lasted nearly two years and has scrutinized virtually every facet of my personal and professional life, the charges deal only with the preposterous allegations of <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, one of the most notorious felons of the 20th century.'' <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> was one of four <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials who pleaded guilty to bribing government authorities and cooperated with prosecutors in several earlier <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> cases. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> testified earlier this year at the trial of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Bronx </LOCATION>, that the company had paid $ 80,000 to <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. The payments, for `` political favors and political introductions'' allegedly were made to <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> `` because he and his wife requested it,'' said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> also testified about numerous alleged payoffs to bankers, businessmen, union officials and a public utility manager. `` The overall <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> investigation is still continuing,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> would not say what <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> allegedly did in return for the payments, saying he could not go beyond the language of the indictment, which did not specify further. Through his spokesman, <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said he was innocent and vowed to fight the charges `` with all of my God-given strength.'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was re-elected earlier this month, despite continuing rumors that he would face corruption charges. On Friday, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Democrat, was sentenced to eight years in prison for his part in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. <PERSON> Mariotta </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>'s founder, once described by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as one of the `` heroes for the'80s,'' was among those convicted of racketeering with <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. At least 19 people have been convicted in the case to date.

<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> met Monday with the leaders of the country's four nominally independent black homelands and declared the group part of a unified `` economic community of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' In a statement later, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he discussed economic matters, political reform and foreign relations with the leaders of <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ciskei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. `` We are a community which places emphasis on economic cooperation and development,'' the statement said. The statement did not announce any agreements, but said the group had decided to refer to itself in the future as the `` economic community of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The homelands, which are not recognized by any foreign countries, are heavily dependent on South African aid to support their meager economies. In addition to economic difficulties, political turmoil and frequent reports of widespread corruption have plagued several of the homelands. In <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>, lengthy hearings have been held into corruption allegations against <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> <PERSON> Matanzima </PERSON>, brothers who ruled the homeland from 1976 until 1987, when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Matanzima </PERSON>, then prime minister, was ousted in a coup. The homeland now is ruled by a 33-year-old army commander, <PERSON> Bantu </PERSON> <PERSON> Holomisa </PERSON>. He recently said it might be possible for <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> to rejoin <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> if apartheid _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial segregation system _ were abolished. <PERSON> Lennox </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebe </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Ciskei </LOCATION>, has often tilted with <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>'s rulers. Both neighboring homelands, separated by a strip of South African territory, are Xhosa tribal areas and <LOCATION> Ciskei </LOCATION> accuses <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> of plotting to take it over. Several of <PERSON> Sebe </PERSON>'s relatives, whom he had imprisoned for plotting against him, escaped with the help of a band of armed white men believed to be South Africans, and fled to <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> in 1987 In <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, an attempted coup by dissident soldiers in February was put down when South African troops rescued President <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangope </PERSON>, who had been seized by the rebels. In <LOCATION> Venda </LOCATION>, thousands of students have boycotted classes to protest alleged cover-up of ritual murders. Police acknowleged that ritual murders took place and said they were investigating. No official account of the motives for the murders has been advanced. In addition to the four nominally independent homelands, six `` self-governing'' territories exist, which also rely heavily on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for economic help.

 Tropical storm <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, just short of becoming the year's sixth hurricane, soaked the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> on Monday and moved into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on a course expected to veer toward <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, forecasters said. `` It's a strong tropical storm on the borderline of a hurricane,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the National Hurricane Center. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>'s top sustained winds were hovering at about 65 mph, Sheets said; 74 mph is the threshold for a storm to be upgraded to a hurricane. At 8 p.m. EST, the storm was centered near latitude 23.1 north and longitude 87.0 west, about 400 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Forecasters said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> was moving north at less than 10 mph and was expected to turn east in the next 12 to 24 hours. `` It's moving toward the north, out in the south-central Gulf,'' said Sheets. `` The highest probability -LRB- of landfall -RRB- is the middle of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s west coast'' late in the week. But Sheets emphasized that <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> is unlikely to become a storm on the order of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> or <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, which devastated wide areas of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in September and October. `` I think it'll be just barely a hurricane,'' he said. On Monday, the storm's rains soaked an area from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> across western <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>, but spared the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION> from major damage, according to <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, general manager of the Sheraton Hotel there. `` I just went around and you can see two or three things down on the main street,'' he said. `` There's lots of water, lots of puddles.'' <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> said two or three light poles, apparently ones that were being installed to replace those knocked down during <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and were n't yet firmly in place, had blown over. A few new palms fell as well. He said hotels wee not be evacuated. The resort town is still recovering from <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION>, which caused extensive damage in September. While still a tropical depression, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> passed south of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> late Friday and early Saturday, pouring almost 4 inches of rain on <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> in 24 hours. It also dumped rain on <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> before heading north into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Tropical depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their top sustained winds reach 39 mph. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> reached that status Sunday. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> is the 11th named storm of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, which runs from May 1 to Nov. 30. Five of the storms reached hurricane strength, but only <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> did major damage.

 At a meeting where more than 20 percent of the leadership was ousted, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it no longer automatically supports government austerity measures. `` While duly respecting independent government decisions,'' it said in a statement, the unions `` will not assume responsibility -LRB- for them -RRB-, not actually having participated in that decision-making process.'' The Central Council, which has a membership of about 220, ousted 45 council members and appointed 37 new members, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported. The meeting defined the fundamental tasks of trade unions as `` protecting and representing the specific interests of workers.'' Reorganization and the change in basic policy were seen as a reaction to an increasing trend toward installing new, independent unions in communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a spinoff development of economic and social reforms here. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> demanded that the government follow a firm anti-inflation policy and called for earliest implementation of wage reform. Living standards have fallen for months, mainly because of price increases and a new tax system, and inflation is running at about 16 percent. On the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s list of basic issues to be discussed with the government at their next session Nov. 28 are living standards, including real wages and income; employment, and social policy, the agency said. Speakers at the council meeting were said to have stressed that the government must declare a partnership with unions, `` as befits discussions between equal partners.'' Some speakers, not identified by <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, said it was not true that the trade union movement had lost the confidence of workers, but admitted that `` some individuals, some measures and certain methods have shaken the confidence of the membership.'' It said said some speakers denounced as `` shocking'' unspecified `` curbs on trade union rights.'' There was no elaboration.

 A double murderer who escaped from a 153-year-old prison in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> by chipping through his cell and using a handmade ladder to scale a wall was recaptured Monday following a daylong search. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, four inmates who escaped from a jail with a rope made of knotted bed sheets were still at large, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, three foreign nationals who tried to break out of federal custody were captured early Monday on a rain-soaked parapet of the prison. In <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>, 37, was caught about three blocks from the prison some 14 hours after his escape. Search crews had used helicopters, and rifle-toting officers stood guard at blockaded streets, while others went door to door in some neighborhoods. Police also had stopped all <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> trains in the early morning. <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> had scaled the prison's outer wall about 4 a.m. using a rickety, handmade 19-foot ladder. Two other inmates apparently trying to escape with him had not yet climbed the ladder when they were spotted by a tower guard, officials said. The three inmates apparently had chipped away at the wall of their ground-level cell for some time, probably for several weeks, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. They were housed in the prison's oldest section, built in 1835, and once they chipped through the concrete they were able to push a stone out of the wall, he said. <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON> was serving at least 60 years for the slayings of two people killed during a restaurant holdup in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He also was convicted of related sexual assault, robbery and burglary charges, said <PERSON> Stabile </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, authorities were searching for four inmates who escaped from the Orange County Jail. Authorities were tipped to the escape about 8 p.m. Sunday when a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> resident reported seeing a man in a prison jumpsuit about a block away from the jail, said sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. The four inmates were part of a recreation group meeting on the jail roof who cut a small hole in the security fence and scaled down the wall using the bed-sheet rope, he said. And in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, federal investigators were trying to find out how the foreign nationals got the hacksaw blade they used to saw through the bars and plastic window of an eighth-floor room. They apparently used twine to drop to a fourth-floor setback of the building, said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> Romolo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Imundi </PERSON>. Marshals using a Fire Department `` cherry picker'' got the prisoners down.

 For someone with a reputation as a conciliator, Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> certainly loves a good fight. He likes to portray himself as a statesman and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s most competent leader, but he thrives on old-fashioned politicking. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> appeared headed for another term in Monday's election, the first time since 1953 that a Canadian leader was able to put together consecutive majority governments. It was a slimmer margin this time than in 1984, when he led his <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to one of the most impressive landslides in Canadian history. The 49-year-old prime minister comes from a working class family in <LOCATION> Baie-Comeau </LOCATION>, on the north shore of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION>. He was ambitious and built a successful legal and corporate career in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. He first tried for the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership in 1976 but was not successful until 1983. He also was first elected to the House of Commons that year. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is the first bilingual native of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> to lead his party, and he has used that fact skillfully in expanding the Conservatives' base in that critical, largely French-speaking province. Support for cronies was charged during his first years in office, dropping his popularity drastically in the public opinion polls. Eight Cabinet ministers resigned in separate incidents, but by the time he called the election Oct. 1 <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> had distanced himself from the controversies and was able to point to an experienced management team. He planned to stage the campaign on competency and the prosperity that lasted through his term to create 1.3 million jobs in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. That all changed midway through the race when the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> took off as the No. 1 issue, turning the campaign into an emotional tide that for a time appeared to be sinking <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. He emerged from the protective cover of statesman to stage a hard, direct fight. By the campaign's closing days, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> was exuberantly telling crowds at his rallies that they had a choice between opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> -LRB- Turner -RRB- the Ripper or Brian the Builder.'' He described the opponents of the trade agreement he signed last January with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as jittery, negative defenders of past traditions that could not survive in the modern world. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, by contrast, saw himself as a `` nation builder,'' ready to lead a competent <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> into full competition with the much larger and more powerful <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The phrase surfaced in the last of six hours of debate last month, when <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> accused the prime minister of selling out <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with the free trade agreement. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> replied that he carried through on the agreement to build <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, ust as his father had gone to northeastern Quebec 55 years ago where he and hundreds of other laborers built a small town. `` I believe that in my own modest way, I am nation building because I believe this benefits <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and I love <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' the prime minister said. Although <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> was widely believed to be the winner of the debate, the momentum did not carry through to the end of the campaign. The prime minister is a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. He is married and has four children.

 Today's Hollywood stars either do n't know how to dress or do n't care what the public thinks about them, top industry fashion designers say. Asked to name six <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> women with class and taste, `` Dynasty'' designer <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> could come up with two: <PERSON> Diahann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` All you have to do is catch a plane to see how far fashion has gone downhill,'' he said in the Nov. 26 issue of <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, published here. `` You see actresses in jogging suits _ I ca n't imagine someone working in their garden this way, let alone going on a trip They owe it to the public, I feel.'' But some of those sweat pants are made of silk and cashmere, and `` Wheel of Fortune'' co-host <PERSON> Vanna </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said fans prefer the casual look. `` They think I'm a real person,'' she said. `` I mean, I wear nice sweats. I'm presentable. And I think it's great because stars are humans, just like everybody else.'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> counts <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaclyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> among the clientele at his four shops on opulent Rodeo Drive in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. While some of his customers spend $ 40,000 to $ 60,000 yearly on clothes, not everyone knows how to spend the money well, he said. `` Stars today are sort of a strange breed,'' he said. `` Some of them reach stardom very quickly. Quite often they're from small, unsophisticated areas, so they really have no idea of how to dress. They wear the wrong colors, the wrong styles. They have all this money and they almost do n't know how to spend it.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Turturice </PERSON>, Emmy-winning costume designer for `` Moonlighting,'' says <PERSON> Cybill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> entrusts him either to design or shop for all the clothes she wears privately. `` She knows the time when it's important to look a certain way and she knows the times when it's OK to be relaxed,'' he said.

 Dozens of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers smashed doors and windows and overturned cars in a Palestinian refugee camp after their bus was pelted by stones, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses and state-run television said Monday. An army spokesman said the incident, which occurred Sunday night at the <LOCATION> Kalandia </LOCATION> camp north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, was being investigated. `` Apparently reserve soldiers were involved,'' said the army official, who can not be identified under military rules. `` If the reports are true, the soldiers will be brought to court.'' Reserve units have been activated to support the regular army in trying to contain the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising against the 21-year Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Six Palestinian teen-agers suffered gunshot wounds Monday in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp, two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> children, a teen-ager and a 55-year-old woman were treated for injuries from rubber bullets fired to break up demonstrations, the doctors said. They insisted on anonymity. The army spokesman's office confirmed two woundings, both in the Shati camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and said it was checking the other reports. The incident at the <LOCATION> Kalandia </LOCATION> camp began at about 9:30 p.m. Sunday when the bus carrying the soldiers was reportedly hit by stones. The soldiers made a circuit through the camp, smashing house and car windows, before returning to their bus and leaving, witnesses said. One camp resident, shown on television next to an overturned car, said the soldiers came without warning. `` I looked out of the window and saw more than 25 or 30 army people,'' he said. `` First they overturned this car. Then they damaged my car, which is parked here every day.'' He added: `` I did n't do anything. I'm an honorable man.'' Witnesses said at least four cars were damaged. The witnesses said the soldiers also broke down the gates to yards and the doors to homes and smashed windows with their rifle butts. <PERSON> Rulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Uye </PERSON>, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said `` well over 20 houses'' were reported by camp residents to be damaged. The organization supervises aid to the refugees. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said the soldiers were not assigned to the <LOCATION> Kalandia </LOCATION> camp and were returning home after finishing duty elsewhere. It did not elaborate. Also Monday, <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goren </PERSON>, coordinator for policies in the occupied territories, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools may be reopened Dec. 1. Most of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s schools have been closed since last February, keeping more than 300,000 children out of classes. `` We have never declared the school closures a policy,'' <PERSON> Goren </PERSON> said. `` Our intention is, depending of course on the quiet, to reopen the schools toward the first of the month.'' The insurrection in the occupied lands has killed 314 Palestinians since it began Dec. 8. Eleven Israelis have also died. On Monday, 20 Palestinian leaders from the occupied territories sent telegrams to foreign diplomats in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, urging them to recognize the Palestinian state declared last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. The message said the proclamation, which implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was proof of the Palestinian people's genuine wish for peace. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has rejected the proclamation, saying it was an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to deceive the world into believing it had moderated its positions.

 Two fire inspectors resigned and a third was suspended over `` shoddy'' handling of documents concerning an <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> diesel fuel spill in January, a police official said Monday. <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroner </PERSON> said the county fire marshal's office failed to properly review <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to reassemble a storage tank that collapsed Jan. 2 in nearby <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> and spilled about 750,000 gallons of fuel into the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Kroner said detectives also found that secret internal documents concerning the tank were released to outsiders he would not name. Fire Marshal <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 38, and Chief Inspector <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 58, resigned after meeting with Kroner on Friday, <PERSON> Kroner </PERSON> said. Deputy Fire Marshal <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Babyak </PERSON>, 52, refused Kroner's offer to resign and has been suspended pending action by the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioners, <PERSON> Kroner </PERSON> said. `` Our investigation revealed some procedural mistakes, some work actions that were not conducive to running a good fire marshal's office, and some other items that we do n't want to discuss at this time,'' Kroner said County Solicitor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> said the action against the three officials has no bearing on whether the oil company followed proper procedures in the reconstruction of the storage tank. <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> said the company never received nor paid for a certificate of approval to build the tank. Kroner began investigating the fire marshal's office on Oct. 14 after he said <PERSON> Babyak </PERSON> produced a copy of a memorandum regarding the tank during legal depositions that were part of <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>'s defense in a federal lawsuit Since soon after the spill, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and his staff maintained that they knew of no memo or any other correspondence giving <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> approval to rebuild the tank. On Oct. 14, according to Kroner, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> attorneys had possession of the fire marshals' internal memo, which never should have been disclosed to anyone outside county law enforcement offices. Kroner said the memo claims that <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> had inspected the area of the tank, looked at some aerial photos of the tank farm, and had approved `` the beginning or start of the project.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> has claimed it had approval to rebuild the tank on the site. `` That's semantics, but it will be argued in court,'' <PERSON> Kroner </PERSON> said. `` Up until these people left -LRB- the fire marshal's office -RRB-, they still denied they gave verbal approval.'' Kroner said <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> had denied the existence of the internal memo until last Thursday, when he admitted he found the original in his desk on Nov. 3.

 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is ready to demand a worldwide end to colonialism and to condemn <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s rule of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The assembly appears certain to approve a resolution Tuesday declaring the 1990s to be the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism. It also will probably pass a resolution denouncing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s control of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Last year, a resolution calling for Namibian independence passed 131-2, with seven abstentions.

When the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was established in 1945, 750 million people lived without self-government in territories dependent on colonial powers. By 1985, fewer than 3 million people still lived in such territories. Talks are under way to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million residents and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>'s 117,000. A tentative accord reached last week among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> paves the way for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, with the one-year transition possibly beginning early next year. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> would remove its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, where it is supporting the Marxist government against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and South African-backed rebels <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since it took the former German colony during World War I.

Under the reorganization, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is taking more direct control over diplomacy and arrangment of peace accords, and delegating the implementation of those arrangements to senior officials. The first major step in that direction came in June and July when <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> took charge of cease-fire negotiations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediation of the Afghan accords were conducted by <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, who received credit for that settlement. Ms. <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> said the secretary-general is making the changes `` in response to the increasing demand for his good offices in the maintenance of international peace and security and for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operations.'' She refused to characterize the shuffle as a promotion or demotion for anyone involved. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> will also be in charge of `` the planning and conduct of future peacekeeping operations,'' a formidable task with several potential new missions on the horizon.

 Utility officials originated the idea for the executive order President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed giving the federal government broad powers in nuclear power plant emergency planning, a top executive of the stalled <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear project said Monday. There had been reports the order originated within the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, as well as speculation that New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> _ a staunch <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> advocate whom President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week named his chief of staff _ had a hand in conceiving the idea. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> had denied it. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON>, chairman of the <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> joint owners' committee, said neither the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> came up with the proposal. `` I'm sure it was the utility people,'' <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON> said in an interview at <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> after a news conference by <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> could receive a low-power license by Christmas if questions about plant owners' finances are resolved _ but he indicated he considers that a big `` if.'' <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> noted that lead owner <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> is under bankruptcy protection. An <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> rule says plant finances do not have to be investigated before a license is issued. Utility officials said they believed <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> signaled that he personally favors waiving that rule, although he made no clear statement on a waiver. A draft of the presidential order surfaced in June, sparking an outcry from <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> foes and some supporters too. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s all-Republican congressional delegation, whose four members conditionally support <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this summer and asked him not to sign the proposal But late Friday <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a revised version of the order, which requires the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to carry out nuclear plant evacuation plans when state or local governments refuse to cooperate. The order appears aimed primarily at <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, both of which are completed but stalled because of government opposition to evacuation plans. In <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s case, the opposition comes from neighboring <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which has six communities within <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s 10-mile emergency planning zone. Asked for details on how the order came to be signed in its final form, <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON> said, `` We were cut out of that process ... six to nine months ago, and frankly I do n't know where it's been in the meantime.'' Asked then what role <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials had in the order, <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON> said, `` We were interested in having it conceived.'' `` I do n't like taking the whole credit, but we certainly were involved'' in originating the proposal, <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> officials also were involved. <PERSON> Zech </PERSON>, meanwhile, told reporters he had not seen the order and was not sure how it could help <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>. Also on Monday, Gov.-elect <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he takes <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> at his word that he was not involved in getting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign the order. During the weekend, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> suggested it was no coincidence that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the order the day after <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was named the next White House chief of staff. But <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> flatly denied any involvement. `` I take him at his word,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said.

 A gunman killed a police officer and wounded another Monday night in a town north of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, then fled on a motorcycle, police said. The slain officer, identified as 50-year-old <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Monteith </PERSON>, was filling in for a colleague on sick leave when he was shot in <LOCATION> Castlederg </LOCATION>, 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> and close to the border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, police said.

The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> said it had a telephone call claiming <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> responsibility for the attack.

 The slugfest bidding for giant <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has gone into extra innings, with enriched offers from two existing bidders, a record proposal from a new suitor and indications that the multibillion-dollar free-for-all may get even wilder. A special committee of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors announced the new proposals late Sunday and said it was extending the deadline for receiving further offers to buy the food and tobacco conglomerate. Not only did the new buyout plans top previous bids, which already were in the unprecedented $ 20 billion range, the committee said every bidder could submit revised offers, signaling that the hefty bids it had gotten so far might not be good enough. The committee, which is overseeing the auction of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>, also has told its own advisers to continue exploring `` all forms of restructuring'' that could provide an alternative to the current proposals.

 You'd think an 81-year-old Texan would be satisfied with a string of careers that reads: star of radio, records, movies and TV, broadcast czar, real estate tycoon, baseball mogul.

<HEAD>Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore Shows Suffer in Ratings</HEAD>

 Sentiment and old time's sake probably wo n't cut any ice at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> when it comes to <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s new shows <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, after all, is the network that dumped `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place,'' oe of the most critically praised series in recent years. Ratings did in `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place'' and probably will be the undoing of `` The Van Dyke Show'' and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>.'' The shows, which play back-to-back on Wednesday night, were in the bottom 10 in the Nielsens last week. The only ratings hits so far this fall season are <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Empty Nest'' and `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>. All three have been in the top 10. `` Roseanne,'' starring <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> as a blue-collar husband and wife, is already pressing <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' for the top spot. CBS' `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' starring <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> in her series debut as a star reporter on a TV newsmagazine, got a middling 14.7 rating for its premiere last week, about half what `` Cosby'' usually gets, but respectable enough. The `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' rating was a considerable improvement over its lead-in, `` Coming of Age,'' which got an 11.5 rating that same night. But it was n't as high as `` Designing Women,'' which got to 15.3. Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with televisions. `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'' is funny, and <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> has a flair for comedy. She plays a mega-talent on the cusp of burnout. The show takes some satiric swipes at television, such as its penchant for turning glamorous airheads into reporters and giving executive positions to people who only recently stopped sleeping in pajamas with feet in them. But <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> got off to slow starts, not only in the ratings but with the critics as well. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> teams with son <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> in `` The <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show'' as a famous hoofer who comes to the rescue of his son's ailing theater in a small <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town. The show combines domestic comedy in the son's home with the doings at the theater. The premise is a great excuse for the elder <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> to display his physical comedy and take a few pratfalls, and the show has grown funnier episode by episode. In a recent show <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON>'s grandson writes a school paper naming his grandfather as his favorite person because he's so much fun. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> tries to live up to his grandson's expectations, while <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> feels rejected. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> plays a widow with a teen-age son who marries a widower with a teen-age son and a younger daughter in a `` Yours, Mine and Ours'' kind of domestic comedy. But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> also brings along a mother who supports every left-wing radical cause that comes along, while new husband <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON> -RRB- has a father who would consider <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> a liberal. `` Annie McGuire'' hit its stride in the third show, in which the sister of <PERSON> Nick </PERSON>'s late wife shows up. It turns out they'd once had an affair _ which <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> worms out of him _ consummated in a guard shack atop the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. The show ends with a night shot of the bridge and romantic cooing by <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> inside the guard shack. The pairing of <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> on Wednesdays probably sounded good on paper. After all, they were once <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s favorite married couple on `` The <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show'' in the 1960s. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s own `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show'' in the 1970s was a classic. The problem is that neither has had a hit show in a long time. A whole generation of dial-twisters has grown up not really knowing who they are except through reruns. If neither ever makes another appearance, however, their place in television's pantheon is assured. `` The <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show'' and `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show'' rank among the best television series ever made. Neither has to prove anything.

 Staying in touch is what the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> are all about. With their audience. And with their music. `` I'd rather appeal to 500 people for the right reasons than 5,000 for the wrong reasons. It's really what you mean to people,'' group member <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. As for their music, <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said, `` We're reducing it to its basic element. Pure energy and spirit. No intellect involved at all, really. `` You do n't want to make it seem that it's really being thought about. You do n't write a song about people being fascinated, it just sort of comes out of you. No preconceived ideas.'' On their third album, `` Only Life,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> stick to the same unfettered approach. The lyrics are terse, like telegrams; every word counts. The singing is deliberately flat, stripped of all emotion and irony. The listener is left to wonder if such words as, `` Nothing matters and what if it did,'' are to be taken at face value or a criticism of that attitude. `` All of our songs are open to interpretation,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. `` I'd much prefer that to saying what the song's about. I think you failed in a way if you have to say what a song's about. It really takes away something from the song.'' The arrangements keep to the basic rock' n' roll combination of drums, bass and guitars. <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> were attracted to the Stooges, the Modern Lovers and the MC5 _ groups more interested in emotion than fancy chord structures. `` It was a combination. One, being that they're pretty simple bands. They gave you the feeling you did n't have to take years of music lessons, did n't have to buy really expensive equipment. You could make music on a personal level. Another thing, they were cult bands. Nobody else knew about them.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Million </PERSON>, who co-writes the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION>' songs with <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, liked the spontaneous feel of those groups. `` The music had a lot of energy,'' he said. `` The Stooges sounded like the guitar player just got a fender, a fuzz box and an amplifier for <PERSON> Christman </PERSON> and just recorded the album two weeks later.'' But that changed in the 70s. `` Then it got away from that. Bands like <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> and <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> and Yes, just the opposite really.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> were high school students in <LOCATION> Haledon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, when the group was formed in 1976. The original lineup consisted of <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> and Million on guitars, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Weckerman </PERSON> on drums and percussion and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> on bass. They made their debut at <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Haledon </LOCATION> the following year, not too successfully, Million remembered. `` The audience was n't getting into what we were doing. Between breaks, they asked us if they could use the instruments and play stuff the audience actually wanted to hear. Then we started playing <ORGANIZATION> CBGB </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Max </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' And then the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> caught on. In 1978, they were called `` The Best Underground Band in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' in a Village Voice cover story. `` Our audience went from about 12 to 600 people,'' Million recalled. It seemed like a perfect fit when the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> signed with <ORGANIZATION> Stiff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and released their debut album, `` Crazy Rhythms,'' in 1980. Here was the `` Best Underground Band'' and the ultimate new wave record label, the home of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON>. The Feelies found out, however, that Stiff had the same priority as the major record companies: the bottom line. `` They lectured us on how to write a hit single. It was like a scene out of a movie,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. There were no hit singles, and despite excellent reviews, `` Crazy Rhythms'' was a commercial failure and the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> disbanded in 1981. Not because they wanted to, <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> noted. `` We did n't anticipate not playing for that long. The gigs got further and further apart. We were n't thinking in turns of a finality. We tend to go where things lead. We got involved in doing different things. Not wanting to get involved with another bad experience.'' But the Feelies were not forgotten. Film director <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Demme </PERSON> had seen the band play at the Whiskey A Go Go in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and suggested that <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> and Million write the soundtrack for <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidelman </PERSON>'s `` Smithereens,'' released in 1982. `` He was a fan of the band. We kept in touch,'' Million said. The <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> regrouped in 1983 with <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauter </PERSON> on bass, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Demeski </PERSON> on drums and Weckerman moving to percussion. In 1986, they released `` The Good Earth'' on <ORGANIZATION> Coyote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. The same year, the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> appeared in <PERSON> Demme </PERSON>'s hit film, `` Something Wild,'' performing a cover of the <ORGANIZATION> Monkees </ORGANIZATION>' `` I'm a Believer'' at a high school reunion. `` It was fun, a lot of hard work, but primarily fun. They made us comfortable,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. But the <ORGANIZATION> Feelies </ORGANIZATION> are not looking to be a ` fun' band. They're not interested in being ` fashionable.' They seek connection with their fans through music. `` The people there are just there for the music. It's not like going to the disco and getting dressed and making the scene,'' <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. Added Million: `` There is n't a scene to make.''

<TEXT>
 In the past decade, seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations pried themselves loose from the dictatorial grip of military men. The march of freedom seemed inexorable. For the 210 million people in the seven nations _ <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> _ the return of elected civilian government brought substantial personal freedom and the restoration of human rights. Now the bright, shining shield of democracy is becoming tarnished. Growing disenchantment is evident in several countries, mostly because of dashed expectations that an end to political repression would bring economic improvement. It has n't proved that simple. Nonetheless, democracy continues to enjoy substantial allure, spreading into the few remaining enclaves of authoritarian rule. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s citizenry, rallying behind the slogan `` the joy is coming,'' voted to end Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 15-year tenure as president and hold elections in December, 1989. Only tiny <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, run by aging, authoritarian <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> since 1954, remains totally outside the <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> fold. And despite the occasional rattling of sabers, and a few dramatic but isolated and abortive barracks revolts in some countries, few observers feel a military coup is likely anywhere on the continent. `` When you have inflation of 1,000 percent a year, you obviously get unhappy people, but that does n't mean they're inviting a return to military rule,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>, a politics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Princton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on the Latin American armed forces. `` The military does n't have a solution to these problems,'' he said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the 1960s they thought they had the answers. They do n't think they do today. `` The notion that somehow they could do it better has been disproved by their own experience.'' In most South American countries economic mismanagement or corruption by the politically inexperienced armed forces contributed to the return of civilian rule. But some of the new civilian governments have not proven much more adept at handling the continent's most urgent, and persistent, problem: grinding poverty. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is considered the most volatile example. The inflation rate is expected to surpass 1,000 percent, the economy is stagnant and little if any headway has been made in improving the plight of a hungry peasantry that feeds the ranks of a Maoist guerrilla organization, the Shining Path. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was considered one of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s new generation of charismatic leaders when he took power in 1985. But his popularity has plummeted because of what critics see as a vacillating economic policy, especially since he alienated conservative parties and businessman with a plan to nationalize foreign banks in 1987. A recent survey by a Lima-based polling firm, <ORGANIZATION> Datum </ORGANIZATION>, found that 60 percent of Peruvians do n't believe a military coup is likely before <PERSON> Garica </PERSON>'s term ends in 1990. But 28 percent do _ a sign that democracy's foundations are less than rock-solid. `` If our problems continue to degenerate and if our institutions continue demonstrating ineffectiveness, the totalitarian temptation will visit us sooner or later,'' said a Peruvian political analyst, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasara </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> also are plagued by economic and social instability, with sky-high inflation rates and tens of thousands of workers striking daily for better pay, paralyzing many basic services such as transportation and the mail. Brazilian newspapers publish regular reports of government corruption, nepotism and waste. Retired Gen. <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueiredo </PERSON>, the last in a series of military presidents who ruled from 1964 to 1985, told citizens to `` forget me'' when he handed over power to a civilian. Now he says he is besieged by supporters asking him to return to office. A popular bumper sticker in bustling <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> wistfully recalls military rule: `` I was happy and I did n't know it.'' President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, another charismatic symbol of democracy's return when he assumed office in 1983, was shouted down by hecklers during a recent speech and his <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> trails the <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in popularity as the nation prepares for elections in May. But such open expressions of dissent and dissatisfaction reflect perhaps the most attractive aspect of life under the new democracies. Freedom of expression and action has been a pledge kept by the new governments. Most labor strikes take place unchallenged and the mass media suffers few if any restrictions. The systematic arrest, torture and killing of dissidents that took place when troops kept order under military rule has been replaced by respect for basic civil and human rights.

 Participation in party politics, labor federations and other social groups both pro- and anti-government is active and broad-based across the continent. The problem, according to some analysts, is that such groups often work at cross-purposes. `` The primary problem in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s democratic reconstruction is the capacity to stabilize the political system,'' said the Chilean political scientist <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON>. `` And the capacity to stabilize the political system depends on achieving basic accords among political parties and the different social sectors.'' Until a country achieves a working, stable political system `` the possibility of a coup will remain present,'' said <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON>. He is president of a Latin American study group sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanism </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> as an example of a new democracy where `` political arrangement is basically working.'' Under <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON>, who took office in 1985 and is considered one of the most widely respected new presidents, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s political, labor and business groups have reached a basic understanding that has provided stability and economic improvement. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> also is often cited as a democratic success story. President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> has overseen an economic austerity program that slashed annual inflation from an astounding 20,000 percent to about 10 percent. The Bolivian reforms were painful and politically risky, with thousands of workers at unprofitable state-run mines laid off and new taxes imposed. But the government's predictions of stability and growth are slowly coming true and, as Bolivians prepare for new presidential elections in May, no one considers a coup even remotely possible in what traditionally has been <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most political unstable country. Not that the military has n't made its presence felt. <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Siles </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>, was kidnapped by police and military officers in 1984 but freed hours later because of a vast public and official outcry. In <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazzos </PERSON> of the air force led two short-lived revolts in 1986 before the government arrested him. A year later, his followers abducted President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> and held him for 11 hours, freeing him only after an amnesty was granted to the rebellious <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazzos </PERSON>. Two brief but dramatic garrison revolts in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, in 1987 and 1988, were defused when President <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> agreed to limit human rights trials of soldiers. In each crisis, it is widely accepted that the civilian governments emerged strengthened. And although military rumblings persist, experts contend there is a new, less threatening tenor. `` The saber-rattling is now related to issues that directly affect the armed forces as an institution,'' such as human rights trials and military spending, said <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON>. He said they no longer are taking public issue with general government policy, or presenting themselves in the role of national saviors as they did in the 1960s. <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> said he does not subscribe to the notion of an inevitable political cycle of military and civilian rule. `` The pendulum has stopped swinging,'' he said. According to <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON>, the military also lacks the broad-based civilian support for a takeover they enjoyed during the social turmoil that affected many <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries two decades ago. `` They have less social force,'' he said. `` No one is asking for a coup.'' But <PERSON> Somavia </PERSON> called the antagonistic relations between the military and civilians `` a central problem that is going to be with us for a very long time.'' Re-establishing a constructive relationship in which the armed forces fully accept civilian control `` is something you ca n't accomplish in one government.''

<HEAD>Is it Japan or Nippon? Even Japanese Differ</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In Japanese this country is called Nippon or sometimes <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION>, and therein lies a seed of debate. `` Why is our country called <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? Its ` official' name is <PERSON> Nippon </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> wrote in a letter published in September by the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, provoking a minor flood of other readers' letters. The 26-year-old student from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> argued that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should `` unanimously use Nippon'' as its own name on the international level _ on athletes' uniforms when they compete abroad, for instance. One of the editors of <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION>'s letters section thought the flurry of response and comment was slightly alarming _ a possible sign of nationalistic feelings at a time when Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was gravely ill. `` It is a bit scary that people are interested in such a issue especially under the current situation, when the emperor's illness has been affecting the country,'' he said, asking that he not be named But the editor thought it was good for the letters columns to be used to debate the issue. `` I guess it would be easier if we could choose one -LRB- name -RRB-, but we can not decide which should be legitimate,'' he said. Not everybody is sensitive about the country's name, or worried that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is getting nationalistic. A foreign relations specialist and conservative writer, <PERSON> Hideaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kase </PERSON>, said, `` I think it's fine to have a few different names. There seems to be no problem using either <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or Nippon. ... It has nothing to do with nationalism.'' A Foreign Ministry official said there are no rules on how to name countries in other languages, and he noted that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is spelled <PERSON> Japon </PERSON> in Spanish and pronounced like `` hapon.'' But what should Japanese athletes wear on their uniforms for international competition? No one but the Chinese would be able to recognize <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s name written in the Chinese characters, which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> borrowed to make a writing system centuries ago, so it has to be written in the Roman alphabet, called romaji in Japanese. <PERSON> Kayoko </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amateur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization provides uniforms emblazoned `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' for international athletic events. `` For major international events, we use <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as the country's official name, because English is the most common language,'' she said But there's no firm rule, and some teams also go with <PERSON> Nippon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Masaaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Obana </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volleyball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the national volleyball team has both <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> uniforms but players wear Nippon more often in international contests. `` Either way, they're our country's names. We do n't think we should be using only one of the two,'' <PERSON> Obana </PERSON> said. After <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>'s letter was published, the volleyball association received many inquiries asking which name is official, because Japanese volleyball players wore their Nippon uniforms at the summer Olympics games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> editor said the newspaper, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second-largest circulation daily, received about 10 letters on the issues. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blahitka </PERSON> from <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> prefecture in southwestern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wrote that she was against using Nippon because many languages as well as Japanese translate foreign countries' names into their own tongue, and English-speaking countries are no exception. `` For example, <PERSON> Bundesrepublik </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> is the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> or colloquially <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in English, and ` <PERSON> Nishi </PERSON> <PERSON> Doitsu </PERSON>' in Japanese,'' she said. Teacher <PERSON> Tatsuya </PERSON> <PERSON> Akizuki </PERSON>, 36, wrote: `` It is a huge task to change the way a country's name or person's name, which has already become fixed in our daily lives, is pronounced.'' `` If Japanese are told to accurately pronounce country names and names of people in the languages of the respective countries, we would be in trouble,'' he added. The origin of the name <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is not certain, but researchers say it probably came from the Malayan `` Japung'' or the Chinese `` Riben,'' meaning roughly land of the rising sun. Historians say the Japanese called their country <ORGANIZATION> Yamato </ORGANIZATION> in its early history, and they began using Nippon around the seventh century. Nippon and <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> are used interchangeably as the country's name

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With little hope of winning the presidency, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s minor political parties are seeking to make inroads in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in national elections Dec. 4. They are counting on a major defection from the nation's two main parties. The small parties acknowledge that their 23 presidential candidates _ including a handful of leftists, a witchdoctor, some retired military officers, and a former <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> president _ do n't have a chance in the presidential balloting. But they say widespread voter discontent with the government's <ORGANIZATION> Accion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratica </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- AD -RRB- and the main opposition party, Copei, will be shown in split-ticket voting that could yield a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of 182 deputies and 44 senators with no single party in control It would mean a major change in recent Venezuelan voting patterns with longer-term effects as the nation slowly decentralizes its political system, they said. `` People are not happy with AD or Copei but they recognize their candidates have the best chance to win the presidency. But their true electoral preference will be shown in the congressional vote,'' said <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON>, secretary general of Movement to Socialism -LRB- MAS -RRB-, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s third largest electoral force. Most political analysts agree small parties, the larger of which are left of center, are likely to post gains in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They note that voters associate the country's economic slump, about to enter its eighth year, with center-right <ORGANIZATION> Copei </ORGANIZATION> and center-left AD. The crisis, caused by low oil prices, began under a <ORGANIZATION> Copei </ORGANIZATION> administration and has continued under current AD administration of President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>. Polls indicate that while over 75 percent of the electorate express a preference for either AD's frontrunning candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> or Copei's <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, only half the eligible voters have decided to vote for one of the two parties' congressional slates The disaffection has been exacerbated by unexciting campaigns. AD politicians bemoan the `` triumphalism'' of the party's candidates, who have depended on <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s popularity to sweep them into office rather than campaigning for themselves. MAS, on the other hand, adopted a campaign strategy that de-emphasized the campaign of its presidential candidate, former guerrilla <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Petkoff </PERSON>, in favor of its congressional candidates. The ticket-splitting would be a major change from recent Venezuelan voting patterns. In the six elections since 1958, AD and <ORGANIZATION> Copei </ORGANIZATION> alternated in the presidency. Since 1973 the two parties combined have garnered not less than 88 percent of the presidential vote. Minor parties had just 27 seats in the last 200-member House of Deputies, including 10 from MAS. AD had 113 seats and <ORGANIZATION> Copei </ORGANIZATION> 60 _ and some of the small parties ally themselves with AD or Copei. But even if MAS gets around 15 percent of the congressional vote, as some analysts predict, it likely would have little impact on the direction of Venezuelan politics in the short term. With <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s overwhelmingly strong executive branch, congressional action is normally limited to making minor adjustments to presidential initiatives. But ticket-splitting could mean a revival of MAS and the ability of small national or regional parties to survive until the presidential election in 1993. Their survival takes on more significance as the big parties reluctantly allow some decentralization of power to take place.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ For most of the 70 years since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> came into being, Soviet history was tailored and falsified to suit the rulers in the Kremlin and the party dogmatists. In today's freer atmosphere, long suppressed truths are allowed to emerge, and the nation is trying hard to come to grips with them.

 In a cool pine glade north of the <LOCATION> Byelorussian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION> where Soviet families used to come to picnic, stroll or play chess, two schoolboys made a grisly discovery. Digging around in the Kuropaty forest during their May Day holiday last spring, the boys unearthed some human skeletons that started a grim search for historical truth. Since then, archaeologists have made wholescale excavations, and researchers now estimate that more than 100,000 people were shot and buried in mass graves there during the political purges of the late 1930s. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the past never lies far beneath the surface. History is an abiding obsession here. For the Soviet nation, whose 70-year existence fits into a single human lifespan, the past surges up again and again to influence the present. In the more open atmosphere permitted by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, Soviets are trying to come to grips with their nation's often dark, troubling and contradictory legacy _ and use it to map a course for the future. `` People write heatedly and passionately about the events of 50 years ago as if they were writing about today's problems,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said this year. `` There is nothing surprising about this. They are talking about the most important thing for us ... about how it could happen that, along with the heroic achievements of the people, crimes against them became possible.'' World War II is re-fought several times a week on state-run television, in movies and documentaries. Rainy fall days barely thin the throngs outside the red brick gates of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Novodevichy Cemetery, where Soviets come to see the tombs of departed Kremlin leaders who once fixed the course of their lives. History is never far behind the headlines: _ Armenians waging a long, noisy campaign to annex the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> are contesting a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government decision made in 1923 that awarded the predominantly Armenian region to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. _ In the three <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republics </LOCATION>, mass movements arise to demand greater autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Some Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians even seek total independence. Demonstrations are triggered by each anniversary of the 1939 Hitler-Stalin pact that awarded control of the states, then sovereign nations, to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which absorbed them. _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, embarked on a bold course to revitalize the nation's economy, trim its bureaucracy and get the citizenry more involved in decision-making, rarely speaks publicly without citing the stagnation of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s rule and the harsh administrative grip imposed by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> In the atmosphere of freer inquiry and debate fostered by glasnost, the study of the past has become both an eagerly shared passion and a bitter, divisive issue for Soviets, with the top man in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> out in front with the calls for increased candor. `` One can not agree with those who propose that we forget our history or use only a certain part of it,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in January. `` All this enables us to draw lessons for the present ... and to disclose more fully the potential of socialism and its values.'' But more than 3 -LCB- years into <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s rule it still is n't clear whether glasnost will bring unhampered historical scholarship and the right to differ on fundamental questions or just substitute one Kremlin orthodoxy for another. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself recently chaired the meeting of a special <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> commission preparing a new `` concise history'' of the party, showing how keenly he wants his influence to be felt in the new Soviet view of the past. School history texts, full of ritual self-congratulations, radiant socialist futures and cartoon-like heroes and villains, were thrown out and are being rewritten. Windows on the past, shut tight for years by the censor, have been opened. Soviets now jostle at lending libraries for works about the long-concealed `` blank spots'' in their history. The book most in demand is <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON>'s `` Children of the Arbat,'' a novel about the bloody swath cut through society by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s political terror that left its traces of horror at <LOCATION> Kuropaty </LOCATION>. And history in the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> era has meant the humbling of the memories of men who, while alive, were spoken of as the worthy spiritual heirs of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: Vladimir I. Lenin.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> monument to <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was spirited away at night. A vandal at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> spilled ink on a memorial plaque to former <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> ideologue <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Suslov </PERSON>. The city of <LOCATION> Izhevsk </LOCATION>, which once bore the name of <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>, spent more than $ 3.2 million to wipe the late defense minister's name off street signs, official stationery and railway timetables. For <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his allies, history matters because it bares the mistakes of past <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> leaders and points away from what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants to avoid: the totalitarianism and bureaucratic choke-hold on society that marred <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule, the erratic capriciousness of <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, the complacency and moral rot under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. `` It is said that people learn from mistakes, and nations learn from tragedies. Let us learn,'' one author, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovrutsky </PERSON>, said in a newspaper article on Soviet history this year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also seeks to right what he regards as historical injustices. By rehabilitating some of the revolutionaries and visionaries <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> destroyed, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been able to resurrect their once-discredited ideas as ideological underpinning for his own reforms. Training glasnost's spotlight back into the past has had sensational results. Among the revelations this year: _ <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> reportedly was clinically dead at one point in 1976 but recovered at least partially and remained Soviet president until his death in 1982. _ <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was described by one Soviet newspaper as a paranoid whose brain was damaged by a stroke. _ <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> foes shot as `` enemies of the people'' in the 1930s are now said to have been framed. Such reports have startled a country long fed a diet of reassuring Kremlin communiques. `` In the past two years, I have learned more than I did in the previous 50 years of my life,'' one middle-aged <PERSON> Muscovite </PERSON> recently told a newspaper. Predictably, the questioning, doubts and criticism, where before there was often only praise, have produced a backlash among Soviets who feel that their entire history, even the building of socialism itself, has been besmirched. `` I would very much like to understand: who needs, and why, to have every prominent leader of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet government compromised after he leaves office and discredited in connection with his actual or supposed mistakes and calculations ... Where did we get this passion for squandering the prestige and dignity of the leaders of the world's first socialist country?'' a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> teacher wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> daily earlier in the year. The official response to that letter, signed by <PERSON> Nina </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyeva </PERSON>, demonstrated how explosive the issue of history in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can be _ and the limits still drawn on historical scholarship. Pravda, the party's principal organ, attacked its fellow newspaper for printing a document lauding <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and forced <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> to recant by printing the Pravda attack. Despite glasnost, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> or <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> are rarely defended in print. Since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy is avowedly the opposite of theirs, praise for his predecessors could be, or might seem to be, an attack on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> or his policy of change. But on the whole, glasnost has meant a dramatic widening of the historical field, and a coming to terms with some of the uncomfortable truths of the Soviet past that long lay hidden or were played down. Historian <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> was referring to the 1953-64 <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> era, but might well have been speaking of all Soviet history, when he said: `` For a long time, a very long time, talking about those stormy years was not accepted practice. It was as if someone's hand had ripped out an entire chapter from our chronicle.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Asir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> remembers the interrogation, the death sentence never carried out and the tiny knots he tied in pieces of string to remind him of what he saw in a Stalinist labor camp north of this capital of the Gulag. <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Richter </PERSON>, a German Communist whose nationality could n't save her, remembers the filthy, crowded ferry ride from <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Magadan </PERSON>, and her husband who never returned. This city of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, like so much of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, is torn between the urge to remember and the desire to forget <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s purges that put it on the map and gave it the fearful reputation it still is trying to outlive. Thousands of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s political prisoners were sent through <PERSON> Magadan </PERSON>, nothing more than a couple of stone buildings and wooden barracks in the 1930s, on their way north to the gold mines and labor camps of the <LOCATION> Kolyma </LOCATION> region of the far northeast. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>, 71, a native of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> in the warm southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, spent the last several of his 10 years of labor camp as prisoner M-1-866 in a camp in the <LOCATION> Kolyma </LOCATION> region. He met with foreign reporters in <LOCATION> Magadan </LOCATION> recently to show them how he made the coded knots in pieces of string to record what he saw. Those strings, hidden in the camp and smuggled out by a means he still wo n't reveal, gave him some of the materials he has used to write about camp life. `` Your life there was hanging by a hair every minute,'' he said. `` You could be strangled by criminals for your portion of water and your piece of bread.'' Half-starved prisoners nevertheless were required to be neat, and even a loose corner on his number badge could mean 10 days in a punishment cell on only 200 grams of bread and a cup of boiled water a day. <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> Magadan </LOCATION> region in 1947, already a prisoner for many years after being accused of spying for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War II. During a long interrogation, the charge eventually was reduced to carrying a poem in his pocket that insulted <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. A military tribunal in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> sentenced him to be shot, but allowed him to ask for clemency and then let him sit for another 90 days while the stress built up and his weight dropped from 70 kilograms -LRB- 154 pounds -RRB- to 42 kilograms -LRB- 92 pounds -RRB-. In the end, he realized `` it was better to be a spy than to threaten <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON> said. `` I understood that if I did n't sign what the investigator wanted, I would n't live another two months. Stories such as <PERSON> Sandler </PERSON>'s have given <PERSON> Magadan </PERSON> a reputation difficult to outlive. `` Magadan is regarded as a city of sad fate. This we remember and we know,'' Mayor <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorofeyev </PERSON> told the journalists. `` We ca n't reject this; we ca n't hide it. But when asked about building a monument to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims, as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and other cities are planning, officials point out the city already has a monument to <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berzin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berzin </PERSON>, an official of the secret police organization that was responsible for opening up the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> with political prisoners, himself fell victim to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blocher </PERSON> expected the house they bought for $ 13,800 from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to provide a steady rental income when they retired. What they did n't expect was the letter from the sheriff's office, ominously headed: `` Notice of Potential for Unknown Health Hazard.'' <PERSON> Blocher </PERSON> had let his son move into the aging, two-level, wood-frame house. Police say the son and four other people turned it into a clandestine lab for making methamphetamine, a crystallized powder that acts much like cocaine. The June 15 letter came five days after police raided the house. Suddenly, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and her husband were absentee caretakers of a building that might be contaminated with potentially toxic chemicals used to make `` meth.'' `` Speed cookers,'' once found maiexist, that it is real.'' However, security on the bomber program will remain tight, and no data has been revealed on specifics of the aircraft's capabilities. `` We're not going to give all that away,'' <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> said. `` It remains a classified program.'' Stealth fighters reportedly have been flying for several years, but only at night. A photo of that plane was released because it is ready for daylight flights, officials said. The stealth bomber, so-called because it is intended to be extremely difficult to detect on enemy radar, has been described as a sleek, dark, flying wing with no sharp angles to reflect radar and built of exotic composite materials, some of which will absorb radar rather than reflect it. Flight tests will be conducted at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, about 70 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said when the drawing was released that the maiden flight would be the short hop from the plant at <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration bomber, as opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate enemy air defenses at low altitudes. `` This is a bizarre-looking machine,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweetman </PERSON>, an aviation writer and editor who wrote `` Stealth Aircraft: The Secrets of Future Airpower.'' `` This is going to be a really unusual, sinister-looking aircraft.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of an F-16 fighter plane, and has no tail. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide as the aging B-52. `` It is revolutionary,'' <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> said. `` It is a unique aircraft.'' In addition to being difficult to detect on radar, it has become increasingly difficult to estimate the final price of the stealth bomber. Recent estimates for the 132 aircraft requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> have climbed as high as $ 68.5 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The B-1B came in somewhere around $ 250 million apiece, before modifications. Stealth bombers could cost twice as much. Cost questions aside, <PERSON> Sweetman </PERSON> said the stealth bomber sitting in the <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> hangar represents `` a massive achievement in aerospace technology.''

 It is hard to pinpoint just when a man decides to turn his back yard into a repair shop for wrecked birds. For <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> it probably came 20 years ago when an anonymous someone, like an unwed mother abandoning her newborn in a basket at the church door, left a red-tailed hawk with a broken wing in a cardboard box on his front stoop. It was a challenge <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> could n't say no to. He still ca n't. That is why his current back yard is an intensive care facility of assorted cages _ some the size of boxcars _ in which he endeavors to restore to the wild squadrons of sick and injured owls, hawks, eagles, falcons and selected songbirds. And the occasional lame duck. In earthly terms appropriate to a pirate's parrot, <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> tells how birds have taken over his home, his bank account, his job and even his wife, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>. `` Birds have eaten me up. They've consumed my life.'' These are the birds who came to dinner, as it were, for whose convalescence <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> flies in 10,000 crickets a week from a <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> breeder, millions of grub worms from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, grasshoppers galore from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and 150,000 rodents a year. `` I have 10,000 meal worms here right now, and they're just snacks,'' exclaims <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> to whom sotto voce is an abomination. `` This cost $ 100,000 last year. If the food was n't donated, it would have cost $ 250,000. Just one rat costs $ 2.50. A mouse is $ 1.09. But I have to do it. No one else is going to.'' <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> may have as many as 500 recovering birds at a time in his 100,000 cubic feet of cages. There's a barred owl on the mend from entanglement with a kite string. A golden eagle with a broken wing. Hawks shot by what <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> calls unprintable `` slobs.'' Orphaned birds raised from infancy. An oriole that will winter over because it did not recover until after the last flight south. <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> still tries to sandwich his profession as a self-employed tool and die pattern maker around a hobby that was once a Sopwith Camel and is now a B-52. This sometimes requires him to go to his paying job at 2 a.m. There are emergency calls at all hours. `` A bird gets hit, falls out of the nest. It does n't belong to the police. Not the dog warden. Does n't belong to anybody. So they say ` Call Soucy.''' A screech owl flies down a chimney and catches fire. Call Soucy. A goshawk crashes through a picture window and lands dazed on a coffee table. Call Soucy. `` There's nobody else to pass them to. The bird stops here.'' Last year, <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON>'s busiest yet, 1,485 wild birds ended up on his doorstep. This included 240 raptors, the carnivorous birds he specializes in. About half recovered and were returned to the wild. Repair is not cheap. `` To do an intramedulary fusion of a bird's wing bone with a pin can cost $ 400 for the operation. Post-op care can approach $ 1,000.'' Fortunately <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> has two understanding veterinarians nearby _ Drs. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Basking </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> _ who donate their surgical skills. `` We can keep a bird alive 90 percent of the time. But can we restore it 100 percent? The bird wo n't make it in the wild if it's only 75 percent So we keep about 100 for educational lectures at schools and such and euthenize the rest.'' <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON>'s preoccupation with raptors is evolutionary. He was born in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, 57 years ago when it had some open land, not the 40,000 people it's packed with today. He learned nature from an uncle, a hunter, a species <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> has no quarrel with despite the many gunshot-maimed birds he's treated. `` No competent, moral hunter will shoot hawks and owls. The bleeping slobs do.'' His interest was piqued years ago when he read an article in Audubon magazine on hawks. So he and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> went out to <LOCATION> Hawk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to see the fall migration when thousands of raptors may fly by in a day riding the thermals south. `` I could n't imagine 1,000 hawks in the whole world much less overhead.'' Gunners used to shoot hundreds of birds in a day at <LOCATION> Hawk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> just to try their aim. This ended in 1934 when a wealthy woman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Edge </PERSON>, acquired the mountain as a refuge for the birds and birdwatchers. Cape May, an even bigger migrating junction at the tip of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, was another gunnery range. This stopped when the federal government outlawed shooting raptors in 1972. By then <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> had been in the bird repair business for four years. They had rehabilitated that first red tail and released it. One thing led to another, so they bought a home in semi-rural land next to the Great Swamp Wildlife Refuge here. It started out as a backyard hobby, a gesture to right some of the wrongs committed by the biggest raptor of them all, man.

 `` The stupidity of man not doing better gradually enraged me. All things on earth are valuable to us because they help stabilize the darn thing. I was raised to think man owned the world. We've got to get out of this idea because we're a part of it. It's all our world. We've got to take care of <LOCATION> Momma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' He had no illusions about it being easy. `` Historically this country has a love-hate relationship with raptors. We put the bald eagle on our national seal. But there used to be a bounty on them. People do n't care if a robin kills a worm. But it's what's being killed that matters. A fox that kills a chicken is a bad fox. If it kills a snake, it's a good fox. To hunters a hawk that killed a rabbit was a bad thing, so they killed the hawk and then the rabbit. Farmers thought raptors were vermin, but very, very, very few hawks will kill chickens. But that's a hard sell.'' <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> accepts raptors for what they are, meat-eaters in nature's scheme, just like the folks at Burger King `` Raptors are truly remarkable animals. An owl can see a lighted match a half-mile away. A hawk two miles up can see a rabbit and know it's a rabbit. They probably have the best eyesight in the whole world.'' He admires their efforts to try and adapt to a world not of nature's making. For study he's trapped a snowy owl underneath the wing of a Concorde jet parked at Kennedy airport. As <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON>'s reputation spread so did the cages out back. But he's a realist He will not turn away a tearful youngster who shows up with a baby phoebe that has fallen out of the nest. But his eye can not be on every sparrow. `` Obviously there are limits.'' He and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> learned as they went along, designing cages and treating the patients so as not to make permanent welfare cases of their ailing flock. There are triumphs. `` In 1982, which happened to be the national year of the bald eagle, one of them fell out of the sky. It ended up here. I took it to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobby </PERSON>, a local vet, and he got an IV into the bird. He found it had too much mercury in its blood. Six weeks later we flew him down to <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in a donated <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> jet with an <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> crew and returned a healthy eagle to the sky.'' In time the big birds began running into big money. `` It costs $ 175 to air freight a recovered osprey down to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after migrating season. I've shipped ferruginous hawks to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. When it looked like <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> was going down in a heap and I could n't afford it any more, a friend said we should incorporate.'' They are now The Raptor Trust, eligible for tax-exempt donations. A local lumber company donates wood for cages. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, which has huge office complexes in the area, gave $ 7,000 for a new cage. In the summer the Soucys have five full-time staffers and 25 volunteers. The hobby has become one of the 10 biggest bird recovery operations in the nation. `` We took a five-day vacation this year, the first in 16 years. I hired <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamy </PERSON>, an ex-teacher, to show school groups around. I told her she'd work harder and be paid less if she came to me. I kept my promise. `` The reality is, how big can we get? We do n't charge for our services _ whom do you send a bill to? _ so we have to beg. That's what I've become A beggar.'' <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> has raised $ 185,000 to buy the property next door for more space and an educational center to make a hard sell a little easier. `` I like to think we're setting an example. In the last 20 years Americans have gone back to being more intolerant of nature, gone back to their computers and Porsches. If they had more sympathy for the planet that sustains us, maybe they would n't puke on their world so much. `` I figure I've put 100,000 hours into all this, and I've never taken a dime out,'' said <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> strolling among the cages under the penetrating stare of his patients. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, the golden eagle, a permanent resident, eyed him dispassionately. Three snowy owls watched unblinkingly. A clutch of great horned owls, as stately as <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices in a group portrait, perched motionless on a dead limb. Their thoughts about <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON>, if any, were inscrutable. His were n't. `` I've thought weekly I'd finally give it up. Maybe something died you'd worked hard over. Twenty years I've been out in the back yard putting broken birds back together. Where did all that time go?'' He stared back at the owls. `` I do n't think I would do it all over again.'' He reconsidered. `` I do n't know.'' He brightened. `` But I've probably got more ` God bless you's' in my life than most people.''

 One night <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON>, who'd played guitar live with <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> on his hit `` Alice's Restaurant'' on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` underground'' radio station <ORGANIZATION> WBAI </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> were `` hobnobbing around in the Village.'' <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON> persuaded <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to go to <ORGANIZATION> WBAI </ORGANIZATION> and perform `` Mr. Bojangles.'' The station recorded it and kept playing it. People listening to Circus Maximus in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> would ask who wrote `` Mr. Bojangles.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was hot. He says, `` I cut three albums in about a five-month period. `` I did n't like the city atmosphere of cutting records. I decided I wanted to get out. I live my life. In the'70s I was in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Doing what I wanted to do, I wound up having the strongest part of my career. `` I do n't have a career. I have an adventure with a guitar.'' With his Lost Gonzo Band, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> cut four records between 1974 and'78. `` Viva Terlingua'' became his biggest-selling album. These days, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> travels with another <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> performer-songwriter and their guitars. He says, `` I go out and work about 10 days a month, on average. Any more money than that and you've got to pay the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> all of it. `` The <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> goes on those huge endurance tours. He has three semi-trailers and two buses. `` You can play it on the guitar and people will be touched. I played two nights in a beautiful wooden concert hall in <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, with 1,100 people there. Three nights later I was in <LOCATION> Keene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, a theater that held about 750 people. I had two guitars and my songs and stories. People had a great time. You need to have a well-rounded repertoire. The symplicity of doing it is enjoyable. It leaves room for profit for the promoter and the artist. `` <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Fromholz </PERSON> opens for me. He wrote ` I'd Have To Be Crazy' for <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> I've cut a duet with <PERSON> Willie </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s songs, ` The Man with the Big Hat's Buying. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> and I have been doing it for the last few concerts as an encore and it has been knocking them out. `` It was time to do something simple again. `` I was running myself pretty ragged through the 1970s with the Gonzo Band. We did 150 or 200 shows a year, an album every six months and were partying pretty hard while we were touring. We'd party at night, travel, do a show We had two chartered planes with us. If we were within an hour's flight of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> we'd fly there and party in the French Quarter till 5 in the morning. We were tearing it up. We were on that kind of roll. We thought it was fun. `` In 1979 I found out I had five years with no tax records. My people had paid some but the records were shoddy. I owed quite a bit and penalties. I had a lot of that to catch up. `` When I hit 1980 I decided it was time to make some lifestyle changes and patch some holes up. I had a 2-year-old daughter. I started scaling down a bit, some tours with the band and some solo. I got my wife more involved with the accounting and myself more entangled with the business end of it. She has been my manager since 1985. `` I had to re-mortgage the house. This is the first year since 1968 I do n't owe anything. I'm actually able to make some gains. `` <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> is 10 now and <PERSON> Django </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> is 6. I wrote ` <PERSON> Django </PERSON>'s Lullaby' for him I make up a lot of songs I do n't write down, that my family can feel and hear them, that I can make my home happy with my music. `` <PERSON> Django </PERSON>'s going to be a golfer. I've been telling him you can play golf longer than any other sport. With golf and a little music, he can have a good life.'' At 46, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> has long-range goals. `` I want to be a productive artist. I want to chronicle my life as I go through it, the hell raising and having fun when I was younger, kids and family, the deepening of my relationship with my wife. I sing about those. `` I think you realize you have n't told people you love how much you love them often enough. I imagine I'll be writing more songs like that. I've been lucky to have this career, not really playing by all the rules. But the game is still a good song. That keeps me in the game.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Sea lampreys, eel-like creatures that attack
salmon and trout, are threatening the fishing industry at Lake
Champlain, the nation's sixth-largest freshwater lake. The lampreys,
which number in the tens of thousands, are finding new targets:
bass, pike, and in some cases, swimmers.</NOTE>

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Papineau </PERSON> still shudders at the memory of the slimy tangle of suction-cup-filled mouths and tooth-laden tongues in the fish tank at <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s Bait Shop. `` Absolutely gross. Horrible,'' she says. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> agrees: Sea lampreys are n't a pretty sight. Nonetheless, he's displayed them off and on for four years. With lampreys threatening the local sport-fishing industry, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> wants folks to know what they look like. `` It's real serious,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, who also fishes commercially. `` I'd say if they do n't control them the lake will be dead within the next 10 years. They're getting on everything.'' No one knows for certain how the lampreys, which are indigenous to the ocean and have no natural predator, entered <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION>. One theory suggests that they hitched rides on boats. Regardless of how they arrived, they've been there for over a century _ and lately, people who rely on the lake for their livelihoods do n't like what they're seeing. <PERSON> Goose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON> is one of them. He quit his job in a furniture factory last year to devote all his time to commercial fishing. `` There will be days when you come out and every fish you land has a -LRB- lamprey -RRB- hit on them, more than one,'' says <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, who's been fishing the lake for over 30 years. `` Some I've cut open and I refuse to eat because the meat looked bad.'' <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>'s not alone. `` I've seen fish jump that had five or six -LRB- lampreys -RRB- on'em, and usually they're about 8 inches long,'' says <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> Willsboro </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> three years ago. `` And they will stay with that fish as long as possible. In most cases that one hit does n't kill the fish. This is why you'll see fish with scars. And if they lose that fish they'll take another one, so they may go through three or four fish until they reach their full size.'' `` It's pretty severe,'' acknowledges <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, an aquatic biologist with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sea lamprey activity is intense, there's a big population, in the many tens of thousands. We should be seeing fish 8 to 15 pounds, and we just are n't seeing them. <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION> historically had a tremendous population of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> salmon, and that population went right down the tubes. It also had a good lake trout population, and that went right down the tubes.'' Lampreys are blamed for much of that loss. They spawn in wetlands and streams that feed the lake, and their larvae can live there for three or more years. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolliff </PERSON>, sea lamprey unit leader for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>, says one female might spawn up to 100,000 eggs at a time. And each lamprey can live up to 17 years, killing 40 pounds of fish during its life. Lampreys, which can grow longer than 20 inches, normally do their damage in the deepest extremities of their habitat. Using their mouths and tongues, the lampreys latch onto fish, bore holes in their sides and literally suck the life out of the fish until they are near death. These days the lampreys in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Champlain </LOCATION> _ the sixth-largest freshwater lake in the nation _ are acting more like predators than the parasites they actually are. Their favorite targets are no longer just salmon and lake trout. `` They're hitting pike and bass _ scaly, warm-water fish that they never hit before,'' says <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an outdoors writer who lives on the lake. `` I caught a lot of pike last year that were 32 inches long and only weighed three pounds. They were like stick fish.'' `` The lamprey bothers the lake trout and the salmon, but it's nothing compared to the job it's doing on the brown trout and the steelheads,'' says <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who dealt with a similar problem in the Great Lakes when he worked for the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> game department `` You do n't see a brown trout in here more than 2 years old.'' Fishermen, are n't the only ones feeling the effects.

 `` Swimmers are even being hit,'' says <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Assemblyman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortloff </PERSON>, whose district borders the lake. `` What that tells us is that there are so many lamprey that they're indiscriminately attaching themselves to whatever swims by because there simply are n't enough trout and salmon in the lake to support them all.'' The situation has been getting worse since the mid-1970s _ ever since <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> began stocking hundreds of thousands of salmon and trout every year to make the 125-mile-long lake a sport-fishing Mecca. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> fisheries manager, says one reason for the stocking was to study the lamprey problem. `` Some people think we've dragged our feet,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> says. `` But if we went ahead -LRB- and treated the lake without evaluating the situation -RRB- we'd have been hauled into the courts and we'd be there forever.'' Still, the study has taken nearly a decade and makes no sense to <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. `` Why on earth they ever did what they did is beyond me,'' he says. `` They re-created the fishery backward. They should have treated the lampreys first and then stocked the fish. They gave them food so, bang, the population soared.'' Last August, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> signed an agreement to work together to improve the lake. In addition, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are cooperating on a plan to control the lampreys. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> have assembled a 433-page draft environmental impact statement in connection with a proposed lamprey control program. If it works, officials estimate 500 jobs would be created and increased sport fishing would generate $ 2.5 million to $ 3.5 million a year. The plan calls for two so-called `` lampricides'' to be applied twice, in four-year intervals, in 14 streams _ nine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and five in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> _ and five stream-delta areas. The experiment, which would begin next fall, would cost about $ 3 million. <ORGANIZATION> TFM </ORGANIZATION> is the main chemical that would be used. The amount applied kills lampreys but can be metabolized by most other fish and has not harmed water fowl, mammals or humans. It's been used extensively and successfully in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and in two of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Finger Lakes -LRB- <LOCATION> Cayuga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seneca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> -RRB- and has proven relatively harmless. The main detriment is that some non-target organisms _ invertebrates such as worms and insects on which fish feed _ will be killed, but not to any great extent, according to the environmental statement. <ORGANIZATION> Bayer </ORGANIZATION> 73, the other chemical, is used in other countries to treat tapeworm in humans and in this country to treat domestic animals. As usual, the notion of applying chemicals to the environment is creating apprehension. `` My organization is very concerned about the program and its impact,'' says <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulhern </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a privately funded citizen action group. `` We've been studying the environmental impact statement and identifying what we think are inadequacies with that report. We've found a lot of discrepancies between the environmental impact statement and information from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> about the chemicals that are going to be used There's a lot more information that needs to be given to the public.'' Like VPIRG, the <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Champlain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a natural resource advocacy group based in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, has n't taken a stand on the matter yet, but its members are also concerned. `` We want to know alternatives,'' says spokeswoman <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. `` We do n't want the public money to get only channeled into a proposal that would stimulate recreational trophy fishing. `` We ca n't lose sight of the fact that we have fish for human consumption significantly impacted by PCBs and chlordane. There's a rule to eat only one fish a month out of the lake. We need a considerable amount of money to find a solution to that. We ca n't lose sight of those types of problems We want people to look at the larger picture.'' New Yorkers got the chance to voice their views on the matter recently at hearings in <LOCATION> Ticonderoga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Plattsburgh </LOCATION>, and sentiment favored treating the lake. Vermonters will get their turn at public hearings next February. Officials from both states will assess the public's reaction and decide whether to go ahead with the plan. For it to work, both states must cooperate.

 <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has made a career of playing high-powered cads. Nevertheless, he's unhappy with the way businessmen are portrayed on TV. In his latest movie, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Maybe Baby,'' set for Monday, he's a nice guy for a change. He plays a successful middle-aged businessman. Still, he fears his comfortable way of life will be interrupted because his new wife -LRB- <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> -RRB- feels her biological clock ticking and wants to have a baby. `` I'd like to find something on Broadway or a picture that involves a family business situation,'' he says. `` I want to play a successful, moral businessman. You're either a cad who's successful or you're a nice guy who is n't successful. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was a nice guy in ` You Ca n't Take It With You,' but he was a failure as a businessman. The two just do n't seem to go hand in hand.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is best-known for his outrageous roles in such movies as `` 9 to 5'' and `` Tootsie,'' and on television in `` Fernwood 2Night,'' `` <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>,'' `` Buffalo Bill'' and `` The Slap Maxwell Story.'' But he's also played it straight, as in `` On Golden Pond'' and the Home Box Office movie `` Murrow,'' in which he played <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> says his view of businessmen is influenced by his former father-in-law, <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, one-time chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had been married to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> `` That kind of integrity you do n't often see on the screen,'' says <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has n't yet found his role. He recently completed production in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, of `` Meet the Applegates,'' a comedy for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. He plays the leader of a group of highly developed giant insects from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> who assume human form to save the world from what they see as the danger of nuclear energy. His character is called <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bea </PERSON>. He is at his <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION> home between the two roles when he talks about `` Maybe Baby.'' An avid baseball fan, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> wears a cap that says `` SA'' to shield his face from the sun on the patio. It stands for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antonio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missions </ORGANIZATION>, one of his favorite teams. He grew up in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and on visits to his home state he occasionally stopped in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, now with the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>, was pitching for the Missions. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> says <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>, once told him, `` I'll bet you bat to right center.'' `` I'd played some ball in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he says, `` and I asked him how he knew. <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> said, ` I know that because that's the way you play a character.' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> could spot it. He once aspired to be a professional baseball player.'' In `` Maybe Baby,'' a romantic comedy, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> sees his good life jeopardized when his wife decides to put her career on hold long enough to have a child. His character has already raised a family and is n't interested in starting over again at his age. The movie also stars <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> as his daughter, <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> as his secretary and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> as his poker buddy. `` He's successful but I do n't know what business it is,'' says <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. `` He's successful enough to knock off at noon for golf. It must be nice to work about five hours a day. The story's about whether it's too late for them to have a child. He says, ` Can you picture a 70-year-old man rooting for his kid at a Little League game?' But to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> it's a case of now or never.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> says he enjoyed working once again with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON>. They were in the 1980 movie `` How To Beat the High Co $ t of Living.'' He played her policeman boyfriend. That movie also starred <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who teamed up with <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> for the comedy series `` Kate & amp; <PERSON> Allie </PERSON>.'' Immediately prior to `` Maybe Baby,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> played a lawyer in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Baby M.'' He had also starred in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> comedy series `` The Slap Maxwell Story,'' which was canceled due to low ratings and a disagreement between <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and producer-creator <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarses </PERSON> over how the show should go. <PERSON> Slap </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, a somewhat disagreeable sports writer, was a nicer version of `` Buffalo Bill,'' an earlier series for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think where we went awry with ` <PERSON> Slap </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>' was that I thought he'd be different,'' says <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. `` I thought he'd be honest, creative, a legitimate, grown-up professional, as opposed to ` Buffalo Bill.' But in the quest for comedy we had a tendency to be like ` Buffalo Bill.' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> was a child, a self-serving, disloyal cad. It was fun to play that. It was funnier, there's no question. `` I would have enjoyed ` Slap' more if it had been funnier. But I'm proud of it. It was not a lot of fun, but that's not always the case with things you're proud of.''

 `` Hello, my name is <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON>, and I have AIDS.'' `` Hi, I'm <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, and I have AIDS.'' The introductions mark the beginning of an uplifting and unnerving theater experience called `` AIDS Alive,'' a revue performed by men branded these days by three letters. Each is a <ORGANIZATION> PWA </ORGANIZATION>. Person with AIDS or AIDS-related complex. They are all members of the <ORGANIZATION> PWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workshop </ORGANIZATION>, and `` AIDS Alive'' is their story. They've told it in high schools, universities, theaters, social centers, nightclubs, hospitals, just about anywhere people will listen. There have been plays about AIDS before, primarily `` As Is'' and `` The Normal Heart,'' both of which had successful runs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and in regional theaters. But in `` AIDS Alive,'' the performers are n't just acting. They celebrate their own lives while facing death. The workshop was born in 1987, the inspiration of an actor named <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON> and a producer named <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>. `` I was diagnosed a long time ago, ages ago,'' recalls the boyish 34-year-old <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON> who has had AIDS since 1985. `` Back then, we just left our jobs and sat around waiting to die. But I knew that if I did n't start doing something, I was going to die.'' He helped create the workshop and set in motion plans for `` AIDS Alive,'' a series of loosely constructed vignettes that tell how people with AIDS do more than just survive. The show grew out of taped interviews conducted with PWAs. The conversations were fashioned into nearly an hour's worth of theater by playwright <PERSON> Lanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, best-known as the author of the Billie Holiday musical `` Lady Day at <LOCATION> Emerson </LOCATION>'s Bar and Grill.'' There are short sketches and monologues. Actors do n't necessarily tell their own stories, although all the incidents in `` AIDS Alive'' are true. Some of the material is devastating. The stories are of the separation of father and son, driven apart by the disease, or of sick workers fired by their employers. But much of it is humorous in a black, Catch-22 sort of way. A mother tells her son she will be serving Thanksgiving dinner on paper plates. One man is harassed by a creditor who, when told the customer has AIDS, snarls, `` So, you're going to take the easy way out.'' `` Humor was a very important thing for all of us,'' says <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Edholm </PERSON>, a workshop member. `` We all have had very bizarre experiences in the hospital with procedures and treatments.'' The actors, now numbering about a dozen, are all volunteers. Usually, there are five men in each performance. `` Most of us found out about the group by word-of-mouth,'' says <PERSON> Edholm </PERSON>, one of the few workshop members who also is a professional actor. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> joined the group after his mother met <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON>'s mother at a support group meeting `` I had no theater experience at all and volunteered with the idea of doing stage managing _ or being wardrobe mistress,'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> laughs. Audience reaction changes during the course of an evening, beginning with silence, then smiles, laughter, even a few tears and then cheers. `` In the very beginning, they do n't know they can laugh,'' Edholm says. `` AIDS is not supposed to be funny. But in a few minutes, they get the idea that we're having fun, and we're laughing.'' For most of the company, appearing in `` AIDS Alive,'' is their only steady job, and they do n't get paid _ just a $ 50-a-month stipend from the workshop. Many had to leave their full-time jobs because they were too ill to work or because they could n't qualify for Medicaid if they made too much money. `` And our medications are very expensive,'' says workshop member <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON>. `` Most of us are averaging some $ 3,000 a month in bills.'' `` AIDS Alive'' originally was written for nine performers, but the roles were reduced to five. `` We'd like to increase that to six or seven permanent roles with two or three understudies,'' says <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Inskeep </PERSON> who directed the show. `` We are trying to find people to be backups, swing people, to learn several different roles in case someone gets sick.'' `` It's still very difficult to get people involved,'' <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON> says. `` There's that element of disclosure about AIDS. It's still a big issue for some people.'' One of the newer members of the troupe is <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who joined the show when another performer got sick. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was given a new role with new lines and was n't simply an understudy for the absent actor. `` It's a living theater piece,'' <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON> says. `` It will never remain the same. As people are added or leave the group, the show changes.'' Now <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Inskeep </PERSON> would like to expand the circle of performers, adding women and drug users who have contracted AIDS, but it has been hard to recruit members outside the gay community. Those in the troupe say their hard work and difficult decision to go public with their disease has been worth it. `` I can only guess how awful things would have been for me without this show,'' says <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>. `` So many things that happen to each one of us individually now can happen to somebody else tomorrow. I have learned so much about what will happen to me later on, so that it will easier for me to cope with it when it does happen. `` The show gets me through,'' he adds. `` Before we opened, I was supposed to be in the hospital. But I said, ` No, I've got a show to do.'''

<DATELINE>NINGBO, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decade-old economic revolution has brought sharp changes in people's ambitions, lifestyles and social mores. Whether in rapidly modernizing coastal cities such as <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION> with its hotels, discos and high-rise apartments, or in nearby towns where peasants still thresh grain by hand, Chinese are saying the changes in their lives go far deeper than mere gains in income. The surge in economic activity has brought new opportunities, new risks and new rivalries as some people get rich faster than others. One who epitomizes the new Chinese dream of success is <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaya </PERSON>. A former peasant and assembly line worker, he presides over one of the largest private companies in <LOCATION> Cixi </LOCATION>, a rural town outside <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION>. His television parts factory will turn out 3 million yuan -LRB- $ 804,000 -RRB- worth of goods this year, and he is a partner in a new chemical fiber factory being built. He has a <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> color television set, a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> sedan and a maid. Ten years ago, <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> was planting rice on a commune, his dreams of studying medicine thwarted by the shutdown of universities by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s 1966-76 leftist Cultural Revolution. `` I learned to overcome difficulties and developed a strong desire to get ahead,'' he said. Now 33, he spends 12 to 13 hours a days at his factory. He has no time to think about joining the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, once necessary for success in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I rely on my own ability,'' he said. Nor does he fear political change. `` If they call me a capitalist, they'd have to call 70 percent of the population capitalists.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuenan </PERSON>, a young <PERSON> Cixi </PERSON> government worker, agreed. Local farmers, he said, are always on the lookout for a profitable venture and most have more than one source of income. Some rent trucks to haul their produce 55 miles to <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION>, a city of 1 million people, for the best prices, or to act as middlemen in business deals, or buy up raw materials in one town to sell for profit in another. Such activities were politically suspect 10 years ago, but they are now part of daily life in rural <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. City dwellers are not far behind. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hangtie </PERSON>, a barber, is one of 60,000 <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION> residents who have opened private businesses in the past decade, and he revels in it both for the profits and the independence. `` I am my own boss,'' he said as he blow-dried a customer's hair in his tiny shop in the front room of a traditional two-story wood row house. `` I wanted to get rich and now I can.'' But not all Chinese are able to that. Income differentials have widened sharply, creating new social tensions rooted in jealousy. A <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> newspaper reported the case of a woman factory worker who beat up a private tradesman on the street because she was angered by his flamboyant lifestyle. Private factory owners in several cities have been attacked and even killed by workers who accused them of exploitation for giving themselves higher salaries. The World Economic Herald of teeming <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, which is 125 miles north of <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION>, said recently that many people's expectations have far exceeded what is possible, and `` the general sense of frustration is threatening to snowball.'' Some older Chinese say the new opportunities came too late for them, while they and others are reluctant to plunge into market competition and risk losing the guarantees of a state-run economy: lifetime employment, free medical care and subsidized food and housing. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON>, a 26-year-old city-employed translator, said he'd thought about setting up a private translation service for foreign visitors to <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION>, but feared giving up his secure government job. One large group left behind in the reforms are intellectuals, who survived decades of political suspicion in the <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> years and now find themselves surpassed in income by <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> the barber and factory workers. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lianjun </PERSON>, the 41-year-old vice principal of the <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION> high school, said she earns 180 yuan -LRB- $ 48 -RRB- a month, including subsidies for food and books; <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> earns 800 yuan -LRB- $ 214 -RRB- a month. `` It seems unfair,'' she said. `` Money is n't important,'' said her husband, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenhe </PERSON>, also 41 years old. `` What counts are traditional values such as family and friends.'' `` The young people's thinking is n't like ours,'' his wife said. `` They do n't like to suffer. They want higher salaries, and when they have vacations they want to travel. It's a new trend.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> is pleased to play an old-fashioned love story with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, although her view of it is anything but sentimental. `` It's like a geriatric Doris Day and <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> romance,'' she says of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` First Love.'' She plays a widow who, a suitable time after the death of her husband, pulls out some yellowing letters she's saved for years and gets in touch with her high school sweetheart. To her astonishment, their old romance is rekindled. `` It's a very sweet love story,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>. `` We do n't get into any of the problems of the world. People say, ` Oh, it's never been done before, older people having a romance.''' Actually, it has been done before. <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> made several romantic movies at an age when most actresses are playing mothers or grandmothers. `` Over the weekend I was watching some Doris Day and <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> movie,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> said. `` I said, ` That's what we did.''' The movie will air this Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Besides <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, it stars <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. It was filmed here and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` When they first sent me the script for the movie I said it's too simple,'' she recalled `` It's too simplistic. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cates </PERSON> said, ` That's its charm. No one has acne, no one sweats.' He called it a fable. It's a fairy tale. It was such a pleasure to do. `` People keep telling me they're surprised to see me do this kind of a role. I guess it's because I was n't the stern <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>. It's refreshing to read a script like this. So much of what you see is junk.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, who describes herself as one of the few actresses who does n't dye her gray hair, stars as <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> comedy hit `` Golden Girls.'' She previously starred in `` Maude.'' At the time `` First Love'' airs, she will have just returned from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where she and `` Golden Girls'' co-stars <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rue </PERSON> <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Estelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Getty </PERSON> were invited to put on a special show for a royal command performance. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> was a Tony award-winning Broadway star, occasional feature film performer and a regular hand in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> TV variety shows before <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> brought her west to star as `` Maude'' in 1972. `` People always judge you by what you did last,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said to me, ` I did n't know you sang.' He did n't know me when I was in the musical theater on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>. In drama school I did classical roles, but it was hard to do classical roles on Broadway. `` I got a job singing in a nightclub. I took myself very seriously. Everyone was trying to sound like <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Monk </PERSON> was running the nightclub, and he said, ` You're so tall and imposing, no one's going to take you seriously if you sing that your man's left you and you're going to throw yourself into the river.''' She never did comedy until `` Three Penny Opera.'' `` I was hired as a singer,'' she said. `` The audience laughed at one song. I was emoting, and I could n't believe it was funny. Then I started to relax and after that comedy came easy for me.'' She was first discovered by <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> in an off-Broadway revue in 1954. Five years later when <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> was doing a variety show with <PERSON> Gobel </PERSON>, he invited her to become a regular. `` I could n't get arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, so I came out here and did it for a while,'' she said. She was also a regular on `` Caesar's Hour.'' She won her <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> for her role as <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> in `` Mame.'' <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> won a Tony for the title role. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> was in the movie version of `` Mame,'' and in `` That Kind of Woman'' and `` Lovers and Others Strangers.'' Later, when <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> was doing `` All in the Family'' he invited her to do a guest role. She played <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> <PERSON> Findlay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>'s liberal cousin <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> took one look at it and signed her up for her own series. `` They said, ` Who is that girl?' By then I'd been around for 50 years.'' `` First Love'' is the first time <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> has worked with <PERSON> Kiley </PERSON>, who starred in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Year in the Life.'' In `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, we all lived in <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and I were neighbors. A picture we use in the movie is a photograph of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> holding one of my sons 27 years ago.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Good Mother,'' ``Child's Play''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` The Good Mother'' Female film stars in mid-career usually turn away from romantic roles to portray mothers. A good example is <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> in her Academy Award-winning `` <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.'' The lone exception is <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>; it's hard to imagine her mothering a gaggle of squalling kids. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> began her transition as the career woman who inherited an infant in the successful `` Baby Boom.'' Now she turns dramatic in `` The Good Mother'' as a divorced mother caught in a custody battle with her former husband. Based on the best-selling novel by <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and written by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bortman </PERSON>, the film describes the life and background of the single mother, who lives on returns from a humdrum laboratory job and the grudging child support payments of her ex, played by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>. Flashbacks disclose the reason for her repressed sexuality; her family had been dominated by an unfeeling, dictatorial father -LRB- <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellamy </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> meets <PERSON> Liam </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeson </PERSON>, an attractive, free-living artist who releases her inhibitions with unbridled sex. The idyll is destroyed when <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON> appears to claim his 6-year-old daughter. In the custody suit he accuses the couple of having intercourse in the same bed where the girl was sleeping. Also, because <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> sought sexual openness for her daughter, <PERSON> Neeson </PERSON> allowed the girl to satisfy her curiosity by touching his penis when she saw him stepping out of the shower. -LRB- This incident is not portrayed in the film -RRB-. <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> is represented in court by <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON>, who warns that her case is perilous. The trial is heart-wrenching, and the result should not be disclosed in a review. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimoy </PERSON> directed `` The Good Mother'' in an astounding change of pace from his last, `` Three Men and a Baby.'' There is no humor in the new film, and some patrons may be turned off by its seriousness. The filmmakers deserve credit for attempting a drama of complex social issues: the role of the single mother; the question of how far sexual frankness should go. But the issues become clouded, and the outcome lacks the emotional impact of `` Kramer vs. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> is adept at portraying the mother's anguish, employing few of her nervous mannerisms. The Irish actor <PERSON> Liam </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeson </PERSON> demonstrates his star potential in an ambiguous role, and <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> offers welcome humanity as <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Glimcher </PERSON> produced the Touchstone film, which is rated R because of language, sex scenes and adult subject matter. Running time: 103 minutes. _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Child's Play'' Weaving children into tales of terror and the supernatural usually elevates the scare factor a decimal or two. Would we have been as horrified if <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> had been a 30-year-old instead of a school girl in `` The Exorcist''? And <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> in `` The Omen'' sends more shivers up spines as a little boy than he does as a grownup. In `` Child's Play,'' a 6-year-old takes on an evil doll. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> is a lonely lad until <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> comes into his life. <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> is all the rage, he's a Good Guy Doll and every little boy has one. <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> is just as cute as a button with his shock of red hair, coveralls, sneakers and wide innocent smile. <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> also is a malevolent mound of plastic whose soul is pure evil. It is the soul of a sadistic murderer who learns enough of a voodoo ritual to zap out of his body as it lay dying in a toy store and into the doll's so he can live forever and settle a few scores. `` Child's Play'' is more than just an odyssey of revenge; it is a chiller that will make you think twice about cuddling those ugly little Cabbage Patch kids or visiting Barbie's townhouse. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> -LRB- `` Fright Night'' -RRB-, who also wrote the screenplay with <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancini </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafia </PERSON>, plunges into the story with a fast-break shootout in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> between the psychotic <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dourif </PERSON> -RRB- and police. Detective <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> -RRB- follows him into a toy store and slaughters <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> with a hail of bullets. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, though, has one more trump card up his bloodied sleeve. Cut to the Barclay home. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> -RRB- is making breakfast -LRB- and a major mess -RRB- for his mom while he watches a Good Guys commercial on television. It's his way of buttering her up so he can get a doll for his birthday. But mom, a struggling clerk in a department store, just ca n't afford it. Later that day, her friend, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>, takes her to a street peddler who's selling one for a fraction of the actual price. It is, of course, the doll <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> clutched as he died. Like most children in horror movies <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> perceives evil long before the grownups do, and knows that his life must depend on his own wits. <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> slowly develops the horror and first unleashes it when <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Dinah </PERSON> <PERSON> Manoff </PERSON> -RRB- baby-sits for <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>. After ordering <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> to bed and turning off the late night news, she's surprised to suddenly hear the TV and see <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> sitting in a chair before the set. It's not quite the heartstopper the next few scenes turn out to be. With her back to the hall, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> hears tiny footsteps rushing by. She thinks it's <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>. Silly woman. And like all baby-sitters in these flicks, she's the first to go: <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> hammers in her head and she crashes through the sixth-floor window to the street below. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> tells his mother, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> -RRB-, that <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> told him <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> deserved to die. She makes <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> talk, but he only says the programmed words the manufacturer put in. Then <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> discovers the batteries still in the doll's packing case! She sneaks a look at <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON>'s empty battery case, and with a turn almost as frightening as <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>'s head swirl in `` The Exorcist,'' <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON> snarls at <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> with a demonic sneer and tells her exactly what he thinks of her. The terror's afoot, climaxing in a scene that makes the Cuisinart bit in the `` Gremlins'' look like a picnic with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Poppins </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> reteams with <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>, who starred as the vampire in `` Night Fright.'' <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON>'s so-called tough urban accent is forced and a distraction from the action. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> is adorable in his film debut, with his deep voice. But the real star is <PERSON> Chucky </PERSON>, who's far more interesting than his human counterparts <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yagher </PERSON> designed and supervised the operation of the killer doll. `` Child's Play'' will not go down in horror movie history, but it certainly has its moments. The <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirschner </PERSON> production for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> is rated R. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Shakedown'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.95; Rated R -RRB-. Trashing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s sleazy 42nd Street strip in a stupid chase scene is the emotional center of `` Shakedown,'' a violent, improbable crime thriller that lasted five minutes in theaters and went immediately to videocassette. It stars <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, two talented and disciplined actors who must be thoroughly embarrassed by their involvement in this witless film, but struggle vainly to breathe some humanity into two-dimensional roles. The name of the screenwriter-director is being withheld to protect his career. Well, all right. It's <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickenhaus </PERSON>. That's G_L_I_C_K_E_N_H_A_U_S This ugly little movie plays like a sadistic Looney Tune, with 3.5 crazy chase scenes, a half-dozen explosions, psychotic, cartoonish behavior by practically everyone, pointless vulgarity and mayhem. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> is the cop pal of <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>, a lawyer about to marry and work for his fiancee's Daddy on Wall Street. His last case as a public defender is a self-defense plea for a crack dealer who's killed a crooked cop in a drug deal Of course, the lawyer's Old Flame is prosecuting the case and they hop into bed without a thought for the personal or legal ethics of the situation. As the crooked cops close in on Our Heros, there is much bashing and chasing and shooting and blowing up of things. If that's what you're looking for, this movie has it. _ By <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` The Moderns'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nelson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 89.98; Rated R -RRB- Why would a woman take a bath lathered in tiers of pearls? It's certainly not the best way to get the neck clean Probably because <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiorentino </PERSON> already had read this silly script and expected to be surprised by a nude <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON> who moments before was downstairs trying to sell a painting to her art-collector husband, <PERSON> Bertram </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. Is n't it every woman's fantasy to make love on the bathroom floor wearing pearls and patches of soap bubbles? <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>'s character is called <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, giving us <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> vs. Stone. So do n't ask who will end up with lovely, bathing-beauty <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>. The raging husband -LRB- John Lone -RRB-, is abusive to <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON>, kicks <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> in the face in a boxing ring after challenging him to a duel and burns <PERSON> Modiglianis </PERSON> in the fireplace. After first, of course, cutting one of the model's breasts from the canvas because a critic said its nipple looked like a wart. Why does <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> stay with <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>? Money. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a starving painter, lives in a garret and even forges masters to survive. He could n't possibly buy the pouting, languid <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> enough pearls in which to bathe Besides, this is <LOCATION> Bohemian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> of the 1920s, and writer-director <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> presents these characters on the cutting edge of a new artistic era as single-dimensional saps and lunatics. He and co-writer <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> may have meant well, but the archness and self-conscious pretension with which they translate avant-garde to the screen sets one's teeth on edge. It's difficult to decide if they're insulting their audience or displaying their own intellectual shallowness. Probably both. The constant lapsing into French with sporadic subtitles is difficult to deal with, especially on the small screen. The literary references are obscure enough that if you do n't know them, you wo n't know what you're not missing. But when you do catch one, it's generally embarrassingly gee-whiz. `` The Moderns'' is a no-win endeavor: There's no enlightenment, nor any loving treatment of artistic eccentrics. Minor characters, including several drawn from real life, float through as proof that this was <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and that it was bizarre. <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toklas </PERSON> are spotted at their salon; <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> is stupidly drunk in every bar. <PERSON> Genevieve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujold </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> give credibility to peripheral but stock roles. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Oiseau </PERSON>, a gossip columnist who dresses up like a dumpy middle-aged woman so he can go unobserved to his own funeral, where a graveside priest eulogizes him as having `` converted gossip into poetry.'' <PERSON> Oiseau </PERSON> gets off most of the goofier lines, including telling <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> at the railroad station: `` I just ran into <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravel </PERSON> in the men's room, but he did n't recognize me.'' Who would, in those high heels and cloche hat? <PERSON> Oiseau </PERSON> sashays past <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, playing the besotted <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, who is mumbling lines that conclude with `` <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is a portable banquet.'' `` You should work on that,'' quips <PERSON> Oiseau </PERSON> with the hindsight we all have that it utimately will read `` Moveable Feast.'' As he and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> head back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Oiseau </PERSON> says he's glad to be leaving <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> because `` the imitators are imitiating the imitators Hollywood will be like a breath of fresh air.'' Amen. The city depicted here is not only stagnant, but bush-league. _ By <PERSON> Theasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuohy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nelson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION>; VHS-Beta, $ 79.98; Rated PG -RRB- Dear Mommy and Daddy: Here I am at Camp Rolling Rock. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, our new counselor, is real neat. She plays a great guitar and sings real good, and loves to take us on nature hikes. Last night, one of the kids, <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON>, told us about a 14-year-old boy who everybody picked on. Well, he killed a bunch of people six years ago at Camp Arawak. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> got real mad at <LOCATION> Phoebe </LOCATION> for telling that story and took her back to the cabin. But we never saw <PERSON> Phoebe </PERSON> again. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> told us the next day that she had to send her home. There are these other two girls who like to smoke cigarettes and stay up late with boys. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> got real mad at them, too, and had to send them home. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> gets mad at a lot of people and they disappear. I do n't think I like Camp Rolling Rock too much. I am not a happy camper. But please do n't let <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> send me home ...

 And dear viewer, whatever you do, avoid `` Sleepaway Camp II.'' This `` Friday the 13th'' ripoff stars <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> -LRB- `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' -RRB- as the killer counselor who dispatches campers faster than you can rev up your chainsaw. She slices and dices all over the place and does in one little darling by stuffing her down the outhouse comode. You can pretty much figure out who <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> is. The why is slightly more elusive, as it normally is in these movies. The fright level in this <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> film, which was written by <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, is not very high. You wo n't bite your fingernails but you might kick yourself for staying with this movie for longer than 10 minutes. _ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editor </ORGANIZATION>.

 `` Messiah'' is the most malleable of masterpieces, and each season seems to bring a new interpretation. This year's version, conducted by <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinnock </PERSON>, comes from the ancient intsruments crowd. It is completely different from last year's `` Messiah,'' a jubilant rendition with a massive choir and roaring pipe organ conducted by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. Both are outstanding additions to a field already crowded with commendable recordings of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Frideric </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>'s most famous music. <PERSON> Pinnock </PERSON> approaches `` Messiah'' more as a meditation than as a celebration. The many virtues of this recording reach a peak of sublimity in `` He shall feed his flock,'' sung by <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofie </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Otter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Auger </PERSON>. At six minutes, this version is a full minute longer than in most recordings _ a daring choice that could fall absolutely flat unless done with the greatest taste and refinement. The chorus and orchestra are superb, and <PERSON> Pinnock </PERSON>'s version should have broad appeal far beyond early-music enthusiasts. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' recording, released a year ago, cheerfully swam against the baroque tide with a big orchestra, a huge chorus and a pipe organ thrown in for good measure. This is `` Messiah'' as the Victorians loved it, the sort of choral extravaganza that has only recently been overthrown by the `` authentic'' approach. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> appears to have settled every interpretive choice in favor of the option that will make the listener's socks roll up and down with excitement. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON>, for instance, embellishes `` Rejoice, rejoice greatly'' with dozens of thrilling notes from the top of her range. The pipe organ joining the frenzy in the `` Hallelujah'' chorus is like heaping whipped cream on mince pie _ sinfully rich. Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>'s version, recorded in 1984, is also big but not invariably loud. He used just 40 instruments from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>, plus a chorus of 100. <PERSON> Kiri </PERSON> <PERSON> te </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanawa </PERSON>, who does n't attempt some of Battle's vocal fireworks but has the richer, riper voice, is an asset of this version. <PERSON> Solti </PERSON> appears determined to put his distinctive mark on `` Messiah,'' notably by forcing the chorus to hush in some odd places. In `` For unto us a child is born,'' for instance, why make a sharp decrescendo on `` prince of peace''? <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> went further out on the early-music limb with his `` Messiah,'' recorded in 1980. The brightness of the strings, plus the sharp-edged sound of the boy trebles of the <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, may grate on some listeners. The <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> version may have the strongest cast of soloists, including sopranos <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkby </PERSON> and bass <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' decision to sing `` in-corr-up-TEE-ble'' instead of the normal pronunciation of `` incorruptible'' in `` A Trumpet Shall Sound'' is a minor annoyance. -LRB- The <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> version is also available as a videotape, recorded at several locations in Westminster Abbey. -RRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>'s `` Messiah,'' in 1982, is similar to <PERSON> Pinnock </PERSON>'s version in spirit and instrumentation. <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> is reticicent even in the `` Hallelujah'' chorus, which <PERSON> Pinnock </PERSON> takes with customary gusto. The early music style of `` Messiah'' is now more than 20 years old, dating to 1966 in this country with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s RCA recording with chorus and orchestra of about 30 each. Tha 1966 version, a breaktrhough in its time, stands up very well today. Indeed, it sounds very much like <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s 1984 recording for <ORGANIZATION> Telarc </ORGANIZATION> with the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Symphony Orchstra and Chamber Chorus. For this version <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> used 29 instrumentalists but doubled the chorus, to 60. Such are the developments in performance in the past 20 years that the Shaw version now sounds resolutely middle-of-the-road. A note on price: <PERSON> Pinnock </PERSON>, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solti </PERSON> fit `` Messiah'' into two compact discs, while <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hogwood </PERSON> take three. The third disc adds at least $ 14 to the purchase price.

<TEXT>
 How does a young actor deal with suddenly being named an international star and `` the sexiest man alive''? `` You deal with it by a trick of the mind,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` You figure: Is it worrying me that much? Does anybody else give a damn as much as I do? So you decide not to. It's easy.'' The <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> method appears to be working. He seems totally unchanged from the time he first arrived here seven years ago after appearing as <PERSON> Mad </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON> in the Australian movie, `` The Road Warrior.'' He still displays a hint of shyness, contrasting with the self-assured roles he has played on the screen. The actor was here for a publicity binge for his latest <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> film, `` Tequila Sunrise,'' co-starring <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s last role cast him as a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> cop in `` Lethal Weapon.'' The new movie puts him back in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but on the other side of the law. `` Things do n't quite match up, and that's what appealed to me about the script,'' said <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` Here's a man who has a very illicit lifestyle and has had an unsavory career. Yet he always tells the truth and deals honorably with people. That makes an interesting combination. `` The script does n't deal with good and bad but shades of gray in-between. He's retired -LRB- from drug-dealing -RRB-. But nobody wants him to retire.'' In `` Tequila Sunrise,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> is at odds with his high school buddy, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who is a narcotics cop. <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON> is the beauty caught between them. The writer is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Towne </PERSON>, best known for writing `` Chinatown''; he also directed `` Tequila.'' `` The script just lobbed into my mailbox one day,'' said <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` It was one of those scripts that you just kept turning the pages; you did n't know why. It demanded a second read. I liked it. `` Towne knows the meaning of the word ` economy.' He can write scenes that say a lot but do n't have any words. In the script there's a book of matches and an ash tray that say a lot. No words needed.'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> sounds totally American in the movie. However, in conversation, the Australian creeps in. That's only natural for a fellow who spent his first 12 years in <LOCATION> Peekskill </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the rest of his boyhood in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>. His mother was Australian, his father an American who decided to emigrate with his 10 children so the older sons would not be drafted during the Vietnam War. Taunted because of his <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> accent, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s ruggedness allowed him to integrate. He was going to be a chef or a journalist until his sister submitted him for a drama institute at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wales </ORGANIZATION>. He appeared in stage plays and a cheapie flick, `` Summer City,'' that attracted the eye of director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The result was the star-making `` Road Warrior.'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> filmed two sequels and also co-starred in the acclaimed World War I film, `` <LOCATION> Gallipoli </LOCATION>,'' and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>'s `` The Year of Living Dangerously.'' His American-made movies have been less successful: `` The Bounty,'' `` The River,'' `` Mrs. <PERSON> Soffel </PERSON>.'' Only `` Lethal Weapon'' has lighted up the box office. He still makes his home in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON>, and their four young children usually travel with him. `` I think travel is good for young kids,'' he said. `` It's a good education for them, as good as they'll get sitting in one place. They're still little Aussies, but I think they benefit from being exposed to different cultural elements, attitudes and expressions. They still speak Australian, though they get into a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> twang when they're here. But I beat it out of them.'' Why not live here, where the work is, rather than <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>? `` Well, I do n't have to live here. -LRB- <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> -RRB- is where I want to live, it's where the family is comfortable. And that's where I'm comfortable,'' he said <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> was part of the Australian film boom, about which he observed: `` I think it's tapered a bit. They do n't seem to have the same flowering industry they had in the late'70s and the beginning of this decade. I'm sure there's a potential there. They've just started up a new film bank that has been around for a while but unfortunately it did n't have any money. Maybe when it gets cashed up they can make some good product.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Digging Is Out; Restoring Is In</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and his swashbuckling treasure hunts would have been at home in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the early 1800s, when a mix of travelers and adventurers became _ by chance _ the world's first Egyptologists The calling still retained a lot of <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s movie character in 1922 when <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, an eccentric Briton, dug into the most famous tomb of all, the gold-packed burial place of Pharaoh <PERSON> Tutankhamon </PERSON>. But as Egyptology prepares to enter the 21st century, the country that gave the science its name is asking modern lovers of its ancient past to give up the shovel and trowel. Do n't dig and destroy, Egyptian antiquities officials are saying, but restore and rebuild. `` Our grandfathers, the ancient Egyptians, were reaching for eternity,'' the acting chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, M.A. Nur-el-din, told the fifth annual <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Egyptology </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's our task to let them remain eternal. It's time we looked on the ancient Egyptians as subjects, not just objects.'' To thousands of years of wayfarers, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s monuments have seemed immortal, a rich and glorious past paraded in stone monoliths and on tomb walls. Evidence is growing, however, that the immortality was fleeting: Time is running out. `` New artifacts keep coming up at new digs ... -LRB- but -RRB- where are we going?'' said Egyptology professor <PERSON> Faiza </PERSON> <PERSON> Haikal </PERSON>. `` We must leave the artifacts safely buried in the ground -LRB- and -RRB- restore and preserve what has been unearthed. `` The once slow process of deterioration is accelerating. We have the usual problems of environment and a rising water table, but now the monuments face the spread of settlements, with sewage and other risks.'' Most scholars are aware of, and strongly support, the changing face of Egyptology, its shift from seeking treasure to seeking knowledge. Many of today's Egyptologists spend their days before delicately painted walls or engraved columns, copying pictures and writings that are disappearing at a frightening rate. Others dig, but in remote sites or at the edges of villages whose high birth rates demand the use of all available land, whether or not history lies beneath it. Unlike the tomb of the boy <PERSON> pharoah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>, discovered almost in tact and containing hordes of treasure beyond belief, many sites in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> contain only fragments only _ pottery pieces rich enough for the scholar but perhaps not substantial enough to raise funds for the ever increasing price of mounting expeditions. Hundreds of subjects tantalize modern Egyptologists, ranging from pyramid research and the Sphinx, to the secret language of the baboons, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the Old Testament, magic in ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, adverbs and adverb clauses, the position of <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON>'s feathered corselet against iconographical sources, the role of the handicapped people in ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the transition from tribe to state and some aspects of the use of honey in ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The profession has come a long way from the image of the solitary Egyptologist trotting over desert sands on his faithful donkey, wind-blasted and poor, trying to fight off eternity-starved mummies and antiquities smugglers with baskets of tana leaves. <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON>, director for the international effort to save the monuments of <LOCATION> Nubia </LOCATION> during the 1960s, has witnessed many of the changes, including the passing of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s heritage from foreign to local hands and items of national heritage required to be kept in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` Egyptology as a science began after different evils,'' he said. `` You had monumental neglect of the monuments from the days of the pharoahs. Then you had Christians and the monuments on religious grounds. `` Then you had ... <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonaparte </PERSON> bringing with him in his attempt to conquer <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> hundreds of artists and scientists, who awakened the eyes of the world to the glories that still could be found in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'' Hundreds came either to study or steal, he said. Then, in 1799, the <LOCATION> Rosetta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stone </LOCATION> _ with its ancient <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> and Egyptian inscriptions _ was found, providing a key to deciphering the hidden meaning of ancient Egyptian writing -LRB- hieroglyphics -RRB-. <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON> has also witnessed high technology replacing hands in an attempt to locate hidden artifacts. Satellite photos provide what years of walking might never show. In some large sites, instruments replace the questioning mind, showing just the spot where buried history can be found, though seldom indicating exactly what lies below. But for most Egyptologists dirt-under-the fingernails is still where it's at. `` You know what things are by touching them,'' said archaeologist and Egyptologist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` You wo n't know what glass is except when you feel it, though high technology has its place. For the past five years <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Egyptologist </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelea </PERSON> <PERSON> Milward </PERSON>, have searched for clues to one of the most important religious relics in ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the Apis bull, on a site surrounded by a village some 45 minutes south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Though they were not searching for treasure and have found nothing of great value, they are content that they have added facts missing from the pages of ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` Up until the 19th century, much of ancient <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was frozen in time,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` Because there was wealth still buried in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, people came looking for goodies and found them. It's a great tragedy, because lay people nowadays are mesmerized, knocked over backwards by <PERSON> Tutankhamun </PERSON> and the famous statues.'' For today's Egyptologist working in the field, the goal is to band together the facts in order to reveal a three dimensional side to what has been found. `` But it's difficult,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, `` because many of the artifacts have been taken from their home. We have parts of monuments, other parts remaining in museums and elsewhere out of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Physical remains are often seen in isolation. `` Imagine someone 3,000 years from now trying to recreate our world?'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said there are few shortcuts in his profession. He walks and walks his site, then walks it again, trying to turn back the clock. `` You get to know your site the way you know your house,'' he said. `` What's happening in Egyptology is the ancient Egyptians are no longer the curiosities they once were. You can meet them via archaeology and not in the fancified terms Egyptologists used in the old days. `` You try to understand them in their own environment. You're not just digging up artifacts; you're digging up people.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Bangles Put ``Everything'' Into New Album</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bangle </PERSON> <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON>'s mom invoked the dreaded `` M-word'' when her daughter recently played her group's latest album, `` Everything,'' for her. `` She thought it as more sophisticated and MATURE,'' than the band's first two records, <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON> said. Maturity may be a dirty word for many rockers _ and <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON> quickly disavowed her mother's language _ but it's an apt description for both the record's sound and the approach the Bangles took in recording their first album in almost three years. After two LPs and seemingly endless rounds of touring, the Bangles say they finally feel comfortable with their craft. `` We're learning to trust ourselves more, to be more emotional in our performance,'' said bass player <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>. `` I do n't really know if you can call it maturity. It's more of an artistic growth.'' The four women of the Bangles, who pay homage to classic bands of the 1960s with their sunny melodies and intricate harmonies, became stars with such hits as `` Walk Like an Egyptian,'' and the Prince tune, `` Manic Monday,'' from the 1986 LP, `` Different Light.'' The Bangles are thankful for their success, but said they needed to take greater control over their music. Producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahne </PERSON>, whose relationship with the band was stormy at best, was replaced by <PERSON> Davitt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigerson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> and sisters <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, who once readily accepted contributions from outside songwriters, each wrote or co-wrote all of the new album's 13 songs. When all four members of a band write songs, they notice when their biggest hits are written by someone else. `` Walk Like an Egyptian'' was written by <PERSON> Liam </PERSON> <PERSON> Sternberg </PERSON>, `` If She Knew What She Wants'' is a <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Shear </PERSON> song and the Bangles hit the Top 10 with a cover of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s `` Hazy Shade of Winter.'' `` It was a reaction to the success of ` Different Light' that made us determined to write as many songs as we could come up with _ strong stuff that we could feel was emotionally attached to us,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said. `` We had a strange, slight feeling of distance from ` Different Light.''' The flip side to trusting your own instincts, of course, is getting burned if the public rejects you. Some critics have grumbled that `` Everything'' sounds overproduced and the songs do n't sparkle. But the public's responding to the first single, a Hoffs rocker called `` In Your Room,'' which is moving swiftly up the charts. The Bangles say they liked the songs they wrote for this album so much they could n't bear to throw any away. <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON> said it costs the band money to pack the record with 13 songs instead of the traditional 10. `` The thought of not having those extra three tracks on the record just to save money makes no sense to me,'' <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON> said. `` I'd rather put out a record that we truly love. `` That's why we got into it in the first place,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said. `` We're really oriented toward the music.'' `` I got into it because of the fashion,'' <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON> said, lampooning her colleague's cliche. `` I do it for the boys,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> shot back. They may joke about it, but the Bangles say they're tired of defending themselves against people who denigrate their musical ability because they're women. The Bangles knew <PERSON> Sigerson </PERSON>, who's produced <PERSON> Rickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> & amp; <PERSON> David </PERSON>, through mutual friends. `` We liked <PERSON> Davitt </PERSON> immediately,'' <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON> said. `` He's been a songwriter and he's from that orientation. We felt more comfortable with someone we could talk to about our songs.'' Those songs are generally the typical pop music fare of love won and lost, with a few twists and turns. In `` Glitter Years,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> reminisces about the mid -'70s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rock scene and laments some of its drug In the ballad `` Eternal Flame,'' <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON> said she used <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> as role models. `` We just sort of let each song lead us down whatever path it would lead us, like putting on a blindfold and just going,'' <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON> said. `` There's no formula. I wish sometimes there was. Everytime I write something I rewrite it a billion times.'' <PERSON> Hoffs </PERSON> said the Bangles feel grateful to get their songs on the radio, since the singles charts are dominated by young heavy metal bands and dance music. `` We grew up hearing the <ORGANIZATION> Byrds </ORGANIZATION> and Beatles, <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> and the Doors on the radio,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said. `` Radio to us has never been a plastic sellout.'' The Bangles will spend much of 1989 touring to support a record they say even moms and dads can love _ they know, because they've asked theirs `` I played it for my dad,'' <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> said. `` He said, ` this is a much more professional-sounding record.'''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The History Is His Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> has based much of his work on historical events. In `` <LOCATION> Mitla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>,'' the history is his own. `` I was looking for a legacy to leave my new family and my grandchildren,'' said <PERSON> Uris </PERSON>, the 64-year-old author of such best sellers as `` Exodus'' and `` QB VII.'' `` Mitla Pass'' -LRB- Doubleday, $ 19.95 -RRB-, which closely follows the lives of <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> and his family, begins in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1956 during the time of the Suez Canal crisis and centers on the experiences of the author's alter ego, <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zadok </PERSON>, a writer covering the incident. The novel then traces <PERSON> Zadok </PERSON>'s ancestry back to the 1880s, allowing various relatives to tell their stories. <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Aspen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, with his third wife, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, and hopes the book will bring him closer to their two children. `` I wanted to leave them with a story of what their old man did and let them know he was not infallible. ... You spend the second half of your life getting over your first half,'' he said. `` I want them to learn that their daddy gets frightened. That he makes mistakes. I wanted to humanize the relationship very early.'' <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> quickly points to his own experience. In `` <LOCATION> Mitla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>,'' the writer had difficulties with both parents. `` Those relationships took me 60 years to get some understanding _ their relationship with me that hurt me a great deal, brought me a great deal of pain as a child. What I long for is a better relationship with my own children.'' Like <PERSON> Zadok </PERSON>, <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and spent several years growing up in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. His father, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON>, was a paper hanger and storekeeper <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> remembered him as an unhappy man. `` I think his personality was formed by the harsh realities of being a Jew in Czarist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` He was basically a failure. He went from failure to failure. I think failure formed his character, made him bitter. `` I think I can say without hesitation that from earliest memory I was determined not to be a failure.'' <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> credits his mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, with teaching him an appreciation of the arts, but says they did not get along. `` Her life was such that there was a heavy distrust of men, in large part because of a very cruel father. We were essentially disinterested in each other. She was inside of her own head there somewhere.'' <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> struggled to establish his own independence and World World II provided the perfect opportunity. `` All societies that I know of are shaped by macho, the need of a man to be macho,'' said <PERSON> Uris </PERSON>, who served as a marine. `` There's no better proving ground than a war. The war came along at a time when I needed to go war. My time had run out at being at home. The war worked into my life.'' After the war, he began submitting articles to magazines and finally had a piece, `` The All American Razzmatazz,'' published in the January 1951 issue of `` Esquire.'' His first novel, `` Battle Cry,'' a story about the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, was released in 1953 and made into a film. Two years later, he came out with `` The <LOCATION> Angry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>,'' a spy novel, and in 1956, traveled to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to begin research on `` Exodus,'' his most famous work. The novel, which depicted the history of European Jewry from the turn of the century to the establishment of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was released in 1958 and sold millions of copies. `` ` Exodus' has been the Bible of the Jewish dissident movement in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> said. `` It's referred to as ` The Book.''' <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> has also written about the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Ghetto resistance in `` Mila 18,'' post-World War II <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in `` Armageddon'' and the Cuban missile crisis in `` Topaz.'' For `` Trinity,'' the story of three Irish families from the mid-19th century to the Easter Rising of 1916, <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> was given the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> Award in 1976. But now the author wants to deal with more personal matters. `` My motivation is to be on a one-and-one basis with my readers. To say, ` Look, I'm old enough and wise enough to work in this area of human relationships.' This is what the world's all about, other people,'' he said. <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> said researching `` <LOCATION> Mitla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>'' made him see himself in an entirely different way. `` I used to think of myself as a very sad little Jewish boy, isolated in a Southern town, undersized, asthmatic. `` When I read all my correspondence again, I realized I was a hustler,'' he said. `` I was tough. I used everything to my advantage. I could be very ruthless. I hurt a lot of people on the way up.'' Now, he said, smiling, `` I'm mellowed out.'' To research `` Mitla Pass,'' <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> pored through 100,000 pieces of correspondence, a process that was physically and emotionally exhausting. `` It was painful. I would get to my office at noon and be dead asleep on my couch at 2. I was so depressed. This book drained me.'' Yet once he began writing `` <LOCATION> Mitla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>,'' the words came easily. `` So much was stored up for so long that I almost set the typewriter on automatic,'' <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> said. `` It's a wild structure but it's the way I wrote the first time around.'' His books are usually enormous in scope, covering extensive periods of time and requiring painstaking research. He has been criticized for an overblown writing style and for making his characters one-dimensional. But readers have been unable to resist his epic tales. `` I have a good relationship with my readers,'' <PERSON> Uris </PERSON> said. `` If you have n't anything to say, you sit down and shut up. I feel I have something to say that has value.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Cindy Walker Writes `Songs With A Face'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, `` the queen of country music songwriters,'' has spent about half a century writing recognizable songs that have been recorded by such performers as <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>. The veteran composer, who lives in <LOCATION> Mexia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has written more than 450 songs that have been recorded. She was a finalist this year for induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. The best tunes, she said in a telephone interview, `` are songs with a face.'' `` You recognize them. You know them. It's like a person. They have a face that's outstanding. Other songs do n't have a face; you just hear them, that's all. The really good ones are few and far between.'' Two of her best known songs are `` You Do n't Know Me'' and `` Dream Baby.'' `` You Do n't Know Me'' has been recorded by more than 75 singers, including Presley, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> wrote the song in the mid-1950s after <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> suggested the title, although he had no music or lyrics to go with it. `` I was in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> for a music convention and he said, ` I've got a title for you. He said you've got to promise me to write it. I was flippant about it -LRB- the title -RRB- because it did n't strike me at the time,'' she said. `` It's about someone you think you know but you do n't. I came on home and two months later, I was sitting in my chair in my studio and that song just started singing itself. I was just carried away with it. `` It took me three weeks to finish. Then I called <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> and sang it over the phone to him. He had forgotten about it, but he recorded it three weeks later.'' Her song `` Dream Baby'' was written in the mid 1960s and was a hit by <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Orbison </PERSON> and later <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> among others. `` It's been recorded by lots of people,'' she said. `` I hate to name names because I leave someone out.'' Some of her other songs include `` In the Misty Moonlight,'' `` Take Me in Your Arms and Hold Me,'' `` China Doll'' and tunes with a Western flavor such as `` Blue Canadian Rockies,'' `` My <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>,'' `` Lone Star Trail'' and `` You're From <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' For the king of Western swing music, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>, she wrote `` Bubbles in My Beer,'' `` Cherokee Maiden'' and `` Dusty Skies.'' Her first big break, though, came in 1942 when she accompanied her father, a cotton buyer, on a trip to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. They drove past the <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Building </LOCATION> and she decided to try to make an appointment with <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>. `` I went into the office and asked for Mr. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>,'' she recalled. `` The secretary said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> or which one. I did n't know there was but one. So I asked for the first one said named. It was <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>. He listened and I sang him the song. He said <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> had been looking for a Western song. He said, ` meet me here tomorrow and we'll let him hear it.' I did.'' As a result, `` Lone Star Trail'' was recorded by <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> and became her first song recorded by someone else. `` It started me off,'' she said. Later, she signed her own recording contract with <ORGANIZATION> Decca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. For five years she was a performer and songwriter and appeared in a few movies but eventually decided to concentrate on composing. `` I've always been a songwriter,'' she said. `` Everything was an offshoot from my writing.'' Her procedure has been to think of a title and then go from there. `` The title tells the story. If you can get a real good title, you've got something. I always write from the title. I've never written a song without the title.'' Melodies flow from the lyrics, she said. `` The words and music come together. It just sort of comes to you. The songs just sing themselves to me. They kind of write themselves. I just stand back and listen.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who gives her age as `` old enough to know better and young enough not to care,'' is still writing. Her song, `` Sugar Moon,'' has recently been recorded by country stars <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Janie </PERSON> <PERSON> Frickie </PERSON> and K.D. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. `` I write all the time. It's all I've ever done,'' she said.

 Why use a book to teach children about the life cycle of the butterfly when they can witness metamorphosis? `` One is an aesthetic, hair-raising experience that is just absolutely dramatic beyond belief. The other, all it is is just reading another set of symbols,'' said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pottenger </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, director of science projects for the Curriculum, <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION>. Substituting words for nature's wonders, unfortunately, is `` what most of science has been'' over the years, said <PERSON> Pottenger </PERSON>. `` You destroy science that way. You literally destroy science by putting it into that form.'' <PERSON> Pottenger </PERSON>, 60, a former high school science teacher, has developed a teaching program that replaces books with `` real world'' lessons. Developmental Approaches in Science and Health integrates science, health and technology with subjects such as literature and social studies. DASH is the elementary equivalent to his Foundational Approaches in Science Teaching a middle school program used by more than 1,200 districts nationwide. He had started FAST in 1966, with money from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> and the state, to take advantage of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s `` natural museum'' environment. It was introduced in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1970 and spread to the mainland in 1976, being tailored to reflect each district's needs and natural surroundings `` We wanted to look at the real world in which the child lived, rather than the textbook world,'' <PERSON> Pottenger </PERSON> said. In DASH, instead of lecturing on the importance of sanitation, for example, teachers are encouraged to whip up some `` germy goo'' out of cocoa and cooking oil that children can dip their fingers into while listening to a poem or two: `` There once was a terrible germ, who was long and looked like a worm. His favorite trick was to get people sick, so they'd lie on their back and squirm.'' Such strategies work wonders, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a campus laboratory school for research in child development. `` If language arts and math and science and you-name-it are all together ... all of a sudden, the kids click, click, click,'' she said, snapping her fingers. `` ` Oh, I get it. I understand and I can use it here, here, here and here.'''

It's not this is the right answer or the wrong answer. There are many right answers for the same thing, and many ways to solve one particular problem,'' <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. The trick is getting students to see how science touches their lives. `` Once the child understands and can use the material to understand their world around them, they're hooked for life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. `` It's when the child does n't understand ... that you lose them. They just turn it off.'' DASH was incorporated this fall into kindergarten and first-grade curriculums at 10 laboratory schools, which are the same as any other school except for affiliation with universities. Course materials are expected to be ready for grades two through six in 1991. It eventually will be offered, like FAST, to public schools willing to buy the material and have their teachers trained by a special team of instructors. `` The major problem has been that elementary teachers generally have been frightened by science because they are fearful they're going to make a mistake,'' <PERSON> Pottenger </PERSON> said `` It's much easier to return to the textbook, which gives all the proper answers.'' With DASH, he said, teachers look not `` so much at textbook answers but real phenomenon. The phenomenon tell you whether or not you have actually a proper interpretation.''

 The 8-month-old was n't fooled when the stopwatch that had looked so interesting was covered with a cloth. He yanked the cloth away. But research under way around the country suggests he might not have been so savvy if he had n't yet begun to crawl. Parents know that children experience all kinds of new things once they begin to crawl: the taste of the cat's food, the allure of their sister's room. But psychologists say crawling also seems to trigger a variety of developmental milestones babies reach between the ages of six and nine months. They learn that toys still exist even when hidden, heights can be dangerous and objects exist that have nothing to do with themselves. Psychologists have attributed such advances to maturation of the nervous system. But the new research is finding that developmental changes do n't occur before babies are mobile, even if crawling is delayed several months. `` It's nothing short of a psychological revolution,'' said <PERSON> Rosanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kermoian </PERSON>, assistant professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're finding that not only are the changes very dramatic, they're also very broad `` We think it's not crawling itself ... but the experiences that are associated with crawling. They have to pay attention to where they are located in space so when they go room to room they do n't get lost. The research has implications for babies delayed in crawling by handicaps or injuries, <PERSON> Kermoian </PERSON> said. They do n't display the developmental changes until they begin to crawl, even if that occurs several months later than average. Infants who are n't yet crawling but get around in a walker show more of the developmental advances than those who are n't mobile at all, and those who never crawl, but go directly to walking, display the changes when they begin to walk. `` There are certain very specific areas where they are developmentally delayed,'' she said. `` ... If we can show where, the better we will be able to develop appropriate therapeutic intervention.'' The research shows that crawling also seems to trigger babies' understanding that they are n't the center of the universe, she said `` What we find is that as children gain experience crawling, they understand better what the mother is communicating about other things that are going on in the world. That's a huge change. If a mother points, the child looks to the event ... rather than looking at the mother's finger or her face.'' <PERSON> Kermoian </PERSON> has a wall full of stuffed animals to test whether babies follow their parents' gazes or pointing fingers to the toys, or whether they will look only at their parents. This also translates into watching their parents' reactions to new people before responding to them. `` They're more likely to use the mother to decide what is an appropriate response ...,'' she said. `` At this age, that behavior is n't perfect, but we're beginning to see it in babies that are beginning to locomote.'' Mobility also seems to teach babies wariness of heights and relationships between objects, <PERSON> Kermoian </PERSON> said. Collaborating in the study are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Telzrow </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertenthal </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>.

 Why use a book to teach children about the life cycle of the butterfly when they can witness metamorphosis? `` One is an aesthetic, hair-raising experience that is just absolutely dramatic beyond belief.

 Advances in computer imaging techniques and biomedical research will significantly expand the use of custom-made joint and bone implants in the coming years, specialists say. `` The technology and research is moving at a far greater pace than we expected,'' said orthopedic surgeon Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stulberg </PERSON>, one of several hundred doctors, reseachers and other specialists at the first international symposium on custom-made prostheses here last month. `` We have learned that a great deal is being done in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that we can profit from,'' said <PERSON> Stulberg </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He said he was impressed by a method developed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> researchers to reduce the distortion in test images of implanted metal joints, allowing doctors to better judge the success of the operation. Custom-made joint replacements are a relatively new development in orthopedic surgery, and their use is not yet widespread, <PERSON> Stulberg </PERSON> said. `` The use of custom-made joint replacements is growing by about 100 percent a year. Their use will spread as orthopedic surgeons learn more about them.'' Follow-up studies of patients who have received custom-made joints indicate they perform better than traditional `` off the shelf prostheses,'' he said. Most replacement hip, knee, ankle, elbow, shoulder and finger joints are made in a small range of sizes designed to fit average-sized patients. However, such devices do n't fit all patients and certain medical conditions require the use of a custom-made prostheses. With the use of sophisticated computer and design technology, the devices can be constructed to give a `` near perfect fit,'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Techmedica </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Camarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, company that makes replacement joints. `` We think this is the method of the future,'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said, adding that the costs of custom-made devices should go down as research costs decline. Custom-fitted joints now can cost up to twice as much as non-custom replacements.

She had a master's degree in chemistry from <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at the time and went part-time for two or three years, but my professor told me if I wanted a Ph.D., I would have to go full-time. I told him I could n't do that because I liked my job too much.'' <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, however, had no reservations about her abilities. `` That's the great thing about industry,'' he said, pointing to other scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> who do not have doctorates. `` I think that is maybe more important in academia than it is here.'' Besides, `` She could have had a doctorate at any time. There was never any question about that.'' <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> later was awarded honorary doctorates, making her _ in her words _ an `` honest woman.'' <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> wanted a career in research, but ended up teaching high school among other jobs after earning a chemistry degree from <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. World War II helped her get into the field she wanted. `` At the time, women really were n't expected to go into those kinds of jobs,'' she said. `` But the war had taken all the men, so that gave me my opportunity.'' <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON>, too, had wandered through other jobs _ at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> universities _ before getting the work he wanted in research. `` I got my -LRB- doctoral -RRB- degree at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> at the bottom of the Depression.

In 1983, he founded the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a confederation of charities that make grants to area non-profit agencies. His $ 130,000 share of the Nobel Prize will go to the <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hitchings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION>, established by friends and relatives for the foundation in 1985 to mark his 80th birthday. <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> met his wife when he moved from his home state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to study for his doctorate at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. He took a room in the home of a Methodist minister, and one of the minister's daughters, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON>, caught his eye `` Within a few weeks, we were committed for life,'' <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> said. `` She was my greatest encouragement and biggest fan.'' She also kept a close eye on him when he became too involved with research, sometimes taking their two children to the lab to drag him out to dinner. `` I remember one morning I got up and made a sandwich, stuck it in my pocket and headed down to the lab. I figured it must be some kind of holiday because there was n't anyone around but me. `` I worked all day, ate my sandwich at lunch, and when I got home, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> said, ` <PERSON> George </PERSON>, do you realize you just spent New Year's Day at the lab?' I really had n't thought of it.'' <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> created an extended family of young scientists and serves as a doting aunt to her nieces and nephews and their children. `` My brother had the foresight to marry and have four children,'' she said of her brother, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, a physicist who lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I was fairly one-sided, spending most of my time working.'' `` She's always been ` Aunt <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON>' to my family, too,'' <PERSON> Hitchings </PERSON> said. An opera buff, she makes frequent trips to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, her hometown. She also is an avid world traveler. `` One of my friends said it would make a shorter list if I just put down the places I have n't been,'' she said. <PERSON> Elion </PERSON> said she had no regrets that her work had kept her from a `` normal'' family life. `` I might have if what I was doing was not so much fun. My mother used to ask me the same thing. I'd bring work home on the weekend and she'd always say, ` Does your boss know you're bringing work home every weekend?' `` And I'd always tell her I was n't doing it for him.

 From the start, <PERSON> Barb </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>'s recipe for scallops did n't have a chance. Out they came, steaming hot and fresh from one of the 10 test kitchens for Better Homes and Gardens magazine, served in tiny portions for a group of food editors gathered in a taste test. `` I think it's pretty watery and the sauce does n't stick to the pasta,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a senior associate food editor. Using outlines from other recipes, she had assembled a group of recipes to appear in Better Homes next spring, but first they had to pass the magazine's test kitchen test. Everyone at the table agreed about the consistency, so the question became whether to reduce the amount of sauce or keep the volume and make it thicker. In its second test, it was decided, the recipe will include two teaspoons of cornstarch, which helps coagulate sauces. Someone else said the dish did n't have much sass, so a bit of lemon pepper was added. Shredded carrots will be substituted for red peppers next time. And so it went for the other recipes as well. Each was tested for taste, appearance, nutritional value and ease of preparation, and each was sent packing with a list of changes. The adjusted recipes will be prepared and tested again, to be published only after the testers are satisfied. Uncounted magazines send out recipes and many have their own test kitchens, but Better Homes, circulation about 8 million, says it has the largest test operation. Some 11,200 recipe tests are done each year, and each is tested at least twice, the second time with changes ordered by the food testers. Almost all of the ingredients are readily available national brands. `` Our recipes are very do-able for a wide variety of cooks, from the beginner to the accomplished cook,'' says <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Byal </PERSON>, executive food editor for Better Homes. `` When we print a recipe, we guarantee that it will not only work, but it will taste good.'' `` People do have limited time, and if they prepare one of our recipes, they know they wo n't have a failure,'' says <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>, director of the test kitchens. `` If we tell them it takes 20 minutes to do, then it will take 20 minutes,'' she says. `` Unless the phone rings or something.'' To make sure the recipes are do-able, the test kitchens are set up to resemble the ones in average homes, with normal-sized ranges and other appliances. The cooks are home economists skilled in different types of food preparation, but they're also attuned to the abilities of their readers. `` We have to make it foolproof so it works every time,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Byal </PERSON>. The cooks at home, she says, have neither the time nor the temperament to experiment with complex recipes that need tinkering. She says the business of publishing recipes has come a long way since the first one by Better Homes went out in 1922, six years before the test kitchens were established. That early recipe told cooks to mix berries, put them in a shell and heat the combination until it became a pie. `` There was nothing on adding sugar or even on how long to cook it,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Byal </PERSON>, explaining that the turn-of-the-century cook had enough knowledge to fill in the blanks. Cooks today have less time to prepare meals and they demand recipes of greater variety and nutritional value, she says. Ms. <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON> says the tests aim for unbiased results. They wo n't rule out green peppers just because one tester does n't like them, for example, and the milder foods will get their tests ahead of dishes that might dominate the palate, such as sweet or spicy hot items The testers say regional tastes are not a factor. Although the testers are <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION>, most have broad food experience. `` You name it, they've seen it,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> of the food editors. `` These are very sophisticated food people.'' Special testers are assembled for special tastes, however. `` We know who the fire mouths are around here and who are the baby mouths,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Stilwell </PERSON>. The fire mouths would be assembled to test chili recipes. To judge recipes aimed at children, the editors assembled a batch of children to do the testing. On rare occasions, says Ms. <PERSON> Byal </PERSON>, a recipe appearing in Better Homes does n't meet the magazine's standards. But mostly, the testers said, the problem with recipes that do n't work is that the cooks do n't follow directions The editors told stories of cooks who tried to take a little sugar out of the jelly recipe to make it low-calorie, ending up with sauce that never coagulated. Another got unusual results by trying to substitute diet margarine. `` To me, it's kind of a challenge, a mystery to find out what went wrong,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Byal </PERSON>.

 One Sunday evening in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, upscale <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> restaurateur <PERSON> Jens </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> proudly served rare saddle of chamois to the venerable gourmet society Confrerie de la Chaine Des Rotiseurs. For that gastronomical victory, and the finding and delivery of the rare antelope meat on short notice, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> had to thank the suburban <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> storefront <ORGANIZATION> Night </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poultry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which can supply shoulder of black bear with the ease of a supermarket selling a chuck roast. Night Bird is a standout, but not alone, among the nation's $ 10 billion gourmet specialty businesses that provide exotic food and drink for an American public increasingly on the lookout for trappings of the good life. `` It was amazing,'' said <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, both of the juicy roasts and Night Bird founder <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prolman </PERSON>'s ability to find a 50-pound cache of the rare meat in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The gustatory brotherhood `` raved about it,'' said <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. For Prolman, Americans who look for quality in what they eat must include such unlikely critters as rattlesnake, bear, alligator, buffalo and beaver, and such toothsome fungi as shiitakes, morels and chanterelles. Night Bird supplies some of the best-known restaurants in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with meat raised for the table. For Prolman, a top-class chef-turned-supplier, his business in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bruno </LOCATION> just south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is an ongoing effort to convince Americans that `` game is not an exotic category. It is essential on a well-balanced classical menu.'' Food specialists looking for simple answers regularly sneer that this country has no cuisine of its own, barring fried chicken, hot dogs, chili and the like. But these doomsayers are wrong, says a man in the know. `` I think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is defining a cuisine at last,'' says <PERSON> Narsai </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a chef, author, talk show host and restaurateur. In general, the incredible amount and variety of fresh foods available in all parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comprise this nation's culinary philosophy That's unlike <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, for example, where there's a set style for the preparation of food, said <PERSON> David </PERSON>. Another gourmet success story is the year-old San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitchen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Specialty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, which annually produces 3 million <PERSON> Effie </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> rum-soaked cakes dripping in butter and calories. From Bloomingdales in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to Marshall Fields in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s nationwide, the outrageous, two-pound desserts sell for $ 17.50 a copy. To make sure every possible American gets properly hooked, <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kitchen </ORGANIZATION> gives away samples of its golden vanilla, spiced apple walnut, lemon poppyseed and chocolate fudge to 180,000 people a year. <PERSON> Burberry </PERSON>'s, the British firm best known for its clothing exports, this fall introduced a collection of fine English foods to specialty food stores and departments throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The product lineup, both individual items and gift packs, includes British teas, biscuits, shortcakes, preserves, marmalades, chutney, mustards, and plum pudding.

 Hospital food, long considered in the mediocre genre that includes airline and school cafeteria fare, is having a coming out party. Make that going out, as in catering. Although still uncommon, hospitals are catering weddings, picnics and graduation parties. A trend could develop as more hospital kitchens get into the act. `` People are going to want to be sick to come to <LOCATION> Bi-County </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON>, assistant director of <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bi-County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. The menu at <LOCATION> Bi-County </LOCATION> stays away from the traditional fried chicken and roast beef. `` We serve different types of chicken, such as champagne chicken, or chicken cacciatore. You can have quiche everyday if you want,'' <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON> says. You can also choose buttered egg noodles with parsley instead of mostaccioli pasta. Five Seattle-area hospitals offer espresso and cappuccino on site. A <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, hospital has done so well with its bakery that restaurants purchase cookies and cakes from them. Hospitals in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> plan similar operations, says <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Apparently, even the experts are finding hospital food to their liking. Northern Dutchess Hospital in <LOCATION> Rhinebeck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, catered a staff picnic for the <ORGANIZATION> Culinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, among the country's most prestigious schools for chefs, <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> says Just as in a restaurant, a hostess at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> visits all patients after their meals are served to ensure the food is satisfactory and the patient received everything that was ordered. Being rather new, success depends mainly on word of mouth. That is spreading quickly. `` We have been doing this for over a year and have been pretty successful. Most of our business comes from referrals from past users. We've done weddings, showers, graduation and office parties,'' says <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON>, who has a degree in hotel and restaurant management. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Havern </PERSON> had her wedding catered by the hospital. `` The food was excellent. People were asking where it had come from,'' says <PERSON> Havern </PERSON>, whose previous caterer canceled seven weeks before the wedding. `` There was nothing traditional about the menu,'' she says. `` We had beef tenderloin and chicken almondine. It was more gourmet.'' And the competition for the new business is keen, <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> says. `` Hospitals are trying to create an environment where someone can choose one hospital over another,'' she says. `` They want to make the experience a pleasant one.''

 Every four years, hundreds of the world's top chefs mix it up in an event known as the Culinary Olympics, a prestigious competition that has bolstered <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s reputation as a leader in gourmet cooking Competing against 1,000 chefs from 30 countries that for the first time included <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, American master cooks this year won the gold medal in the hot food category for a record third time in a row. The hot food gold medal is awarded after 150 visitors at the event join 15 gourmet judges in tasting the competing dishes. The winning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hot food recipe: <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> oyster consomme soup, an entree of <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> squab with lentils, cabbage and rye turnovers, topped off with a delicacy entitled `` Big Apple'' dessert with kiln-dried cherry sauce. It is the only category of food that is actually consumed at the cooking and baking bash that has it roots in a competition that started in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> in 1894. The gourmet competition has grown into the most important event of its kind, assuming the nickname of Culinary Olympics. It is always held in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. This year's event, staged at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s huge fairgrounds complex, drew 60,000 visitors to the world's largest display of gourmet delicacies. The most prestigious gold medal, in the overall category, went to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> winning the silver and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team the bronze. National teams competed in four categories _ show platters, hot meals displayed cold, hot food competition and pastries. The Swiss won in two of the four categories and placed second in hot meals displayed cold. Their recipes consisted of an assortment of pastries and show plates, including a light foamy creamed corn with veal thymus, rolled beef and veal cutlets with basil, a heavy red wine sauce, and chocolate tureen with truffels. But the Swiss gold was based on food displays, which are works of art and food for the eye but not meant to be eaten. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> took the silver medal and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> the bronze in the hot food category. National team members representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were headed by team manager <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Culinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>.

 An <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> beverage producer hoping for spirited competition with the Soviets has begun bottling vodka made with glacier water. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountaintop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Attakiska </LOCATION> vodka that his firm began bottling in November will be sold intially in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and in Eastern states, with sales later expected to reach other parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> plus some <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> nations. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he expects an immediate monthly demand for 2,000 to 3,000 cases of the new vodka. Three percent of total sales are targeted for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, he said. `` While people are, on the whole, drinking less, they are more discriminating in what they are drinking,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` Today's consumer is more sophisticated and is willing to spend the few extra dollars it takes to buy the best vodka available. He also said he is relying on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> mystique to draw people to the product for a first-time sip. `` The mystique and character of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> will be key to breaching the stronghold of the established market leaders,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The production process is described as one that takes the Soviet method a step further through use of `` the pure and distinctive glacier waters available in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'' and through a special finishing process. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he has been working with a <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, marketing firm to launch the vodka. His other products include <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> bottled water and bagged beverage ice chipped from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> glaciers. He said the <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> vodka plant is a $ 500,000, high-speed facility built to produce more than 5 million bottles of vodka annually. He is offering two sizes, with suggested retail prices of $ 12 and $ 16. The bottles bear a label with an eagle and a star, and carry a pewter-colored seal stamped with the words `` Made in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> ... Attakiska.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said that by year's end he expects to operate with two shifts involving a total of 21 full - and part-time employees `` The vodka market is huge,'' he said, and the percentage of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand met with imported versions of the drink has been increasing in recent years. Educated as a zoologist, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 40, said he got into the beverage business after he and a partner, <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, started a business in the field of water treatment. With much of that enterprise related to the oil industry, activity for the men dwindled as the oil boom flattened, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. He and <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> had been developing a consumer division in their firm, <ORGANIZATION> Wetco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and those operations carried them through the bad times in the petroleum industry, he said.

 Southerners drank more alcoholic beverages than residents of any other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> region last year, and households with incomes above $ 35,000 drank more than any other income group, a study found.

The survey, compiled by <ORGANIZATION> NFO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, covered beverage consumption by location, time of day, sex, age, geographic region and household income. The South, when considered as one of four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regions, drank the most alcoholic beverages _ 32.3 percent of all consumed _ followed by the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> at 24.8 percent, the North Central region at 24.1 percent and the West at 18.8 percent. But the West led the nation in wine consumption, at 31.3 percent of all wine drunk. Southerners drank 39.2 percent of all wine coolers and 33.8 percent of beer, leading in those categories. Consumption of distilled spirits, or hard liquor, was almost evenly divided among the four regions.

 <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> clearly is one guy you would n't want to mess with on the wrestling mat _ or in the kitchen. At 24, <ORGANIZATION> LeClerc </ORGANIZATION> has a solid hold on two divergent careers. In fact, when they're in season, many of the wrestlers who train under <ORGANIZATION> LeClerc </ORGANIZATION> try to think about anything but food. Making weight is all that matters and the delicacies that come out of <ORGANIZATION> LeClerc </ORGANIZATION>'s kitchen would n't help that cause. `` They have joked about it,'' <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> says of the wrestlers he coached at <ORGANIZATION> Troy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> last season. `` They would make comments like, ` Are you going to make us something to eat after practice, coach?''' As a macho sport, wrestling seems to have little in common with catering. But <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> points to the precision of preparing a special food dish and the technique needed to successfully perform a difficult wrestling move. <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON>'s business, called Charmont, is busier than ever these days. With wrestling season coming, the gas on the stove will be turned down as the heat on the mat is turned up. <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> is in his first season as head coach at <ORGANIZATION> Southfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where the wrestling program has been lackluster in recent years. When athletic director <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Carinci </PERSON> heard <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> was a caterer, he was pleased. `` My reaction was, ` That sounds great. He could cater our sports banquet,''' <PERSON> Carinci </PERSON> says. But <PERSON> Carinci </PERSON> says <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> was hired for his wrestling, not his culinary, credentials. After the job was posted among teachers and staff, <PERSON> Carinci </PERSON> interviewed and hired <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON>, whose catering business is in nearby <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> has been wrestling since kindergarten; his kitchen career began at 13 when he weighed dough at a pizza parlor owned by a family friend Then came the sauce. Later, he experimented with homemade soups at the <ORGANIZATION> Maple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> restaurant. <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> has worked in other restaurants and, in 1987, he received an associate degree in culinary arts. `` It was realizing that I had a talent early,'' <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> says. `` There were certain things I could do that other people in the restaurant who were much older and more experienced could n't do.'' While he has plenty of wedding and church business right now, <ORGANIZATION> LeClerc </ORGANIZATION> is probably two years away from opening his own kitchen. When that happens, he has a new name in mind, `` What Dreams Are Made Of.'' <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> says he sees his kitchen vocation as helping his coaching job. `` Maybe if I did do the sports banquet and the basketball coach liked the food, he'd give up the gym one or two days a week so the wrestling team could use it,'' he says. <PERSON> LeClerc </PERSON> says he knows of no colleagues who cook at all, let alone to make a living. The federal government does n't either. `` We keep track of people who have two jobs but we kind of keep a little more in the mainstream,'' says <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 With more than 25,000 restaurants within its borders, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> might well be considered the culinary crossroads of the world. Diners can choose from what the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> describes as a `` cornucopia of international cuisines,'' including Brazilian, Cajun, Chinese, French, German, Greek, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, Russian, Spanish, Thai or Vietnamese specialties. But at Rockefeller Center, in the very heart of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, patrons also might encounter such attractions as `` Breakfast at the O.K. Corral,'' lunch selections from `` The Firefighter's Cookbook,'' or a dinner menu built around recipes borrowed from the tasty meals served to <ORGANIZATION> Ringling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Barnum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> circus performers. Such offbeat items are most often seen on the menus of the American Festival Cafe, one of three restaurants wrapped around the famed ice-skating rink -LRB- which becomes an open air garden cafe during the warm weather season -RRB-. The other two eateries are the elegant Sea Grill, which specializes in seafood, and Savories, a casual restaurant geared to speedy service and takeout delectables. The emphasis at all three is on all-American dining. The wine list is strictly domestic and the beer choices feature regional American brews. Customers at the American Festival when the `` O.K. Corral'' breakfast was offered in 1986 found such imaginative menu offerings as apples baked in bourbon, eggs scrambled with frizzled beef jerky, oatmeal flapjacks with molasses-stewed prunes and Judge <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>'s beans <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, who has helped plan and promote such off-the-beaten-track themes since the restaurant opened four years ago, explains how beans usually were prepared in the judge's `` Wild West'' days: `` By the time the pale pink beans called <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> strawberries had cooked all night in their covering of bourbon, onions, molasses, salt pork and spices, the bourbon's alcohol had entirely evaporated, leaving behind only the mellow smoky flavor of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s pride as a reminder of the previous evening's carouse.'' According to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, public relations consultant for <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the three eateries, adopting new themes and changing menus several times a year is not a simple task _ especially when the restaurant serves about 450,000 meals annually, matching the combined total of 450,000 meals served at the other two restaurants. `` It's not the easiest thing in the world to do with a restaurant, because change _ as it is for people _ is difficult for restaurants. You have to extend yourself to change rather than keep on doing the same thing,'' she explains. `` Changing a menu requires an extraordinary pulling together of a very large team. Everybody has to cooperate when you have a change ... When I have an idea _ sometimes even supplying recipes for them _ the chef is always there because the cooking people are involved from the beginning. `` There's also the purchasing and marketing departments, and the liquor buyers, and so on. Then when the new menu is set and tested and ready to be printed on paper it involves everybody in the restaurant who serves it. `` There are meetings by our management staff to teach people who serve it what it is, how it looks, how it tastes, how it's served.'' When `` firehouse cooking'' was the theme early last year, the program was billed as a tribute to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s firehouse chefs. All of the recipes were created by firefighters and most were taken from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sineno </PERSON>'s best-selling `` The Firefighter's Cookbook.'' During the testing of the chef's cooking of recipes being considered for the menu, the Firefighters Tasting Panel discovered something new, Miss <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> recalls. As she explained in the American Festival newsletter: `` They pointed out that there must be some mistake in the manicotti _ delicious as it was -LRB- and please pass some more -RRB- theirs had never had a sauce like that. It took our forensic team some time to determine that two recipes had inadvertently been combined and that <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>'s manicotti had been topped with a sauce based on his artichoke pie. Thus are great dishes born.'' It was named `` Manicotti with Accidental Sauce'' and was the first dish to earn a place on the firehouse cooking menu. The circus theme featured a menu recalling the days when <ORGANIZATION> Ringling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and company played under canvas and traveled on a train a hundred cars long, carrying some 1,400 people, lions, tigers and elephants. The fun menu, `` The Cooking of the Circus Stars,'' was printed in red, white and blue and borrowed the traditional hyperbole of circus promotions. It declared the offerings as `` The Most Gorgeous and Princely Spectacle of Monumental Magnificence Ever Beforked.''

<TEXT>
 A lucky 1,750 lottery winners delight each Christmas to the toasts and tastes of the annual Bracebridge dinner at Yosemite National Park, complete with snow if you're even luckier. The toasts are echoed by the <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chorale </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Bracebridge </LOCATION> cast from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area, some of them having been involved with the dinner for more than 30 years. The tastes are those of a sumptuous seven-course dinner in the high-ceilinged, log-beamed Ahwahnee Hotel. Five seatings of 350 revelers each are held yearly, two on Dec. 22, one on Christmas Eve and two on Christmas Day. The four-hour pageant is set amidst <ORGANIZATION> Squire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bracebridge </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christmas </ORGANIZATION> celebration adapted from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Irving's `` Sketch Book'' account of Christmas at Bracebridge Hall, a fictional English country estate in the late 1700s. Naturalist-photographer <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> helped start the lavish feast in 1927, the year the hotel opened. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was the first jester, the Lord of Misrule, and, in 1929, assumed the role of director. Four years after his death, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' spirit still pervades the period-dress gathering, ironically with a ban on cameras. Once a guest has beaten the greater than 10-1 odds of being chosen in the $ 100 dinner lottery, he or she is advised by letter to keep in line with long-standing tradition. `` We insist that all Bracebridge Dinner guests refrain from bringing cameras into the dinner room,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wymore </PERSON>, general manager of the Ahwahnee, says. `` This policy was established at the request of <PERSON> Ansel </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> to preserve the atmosphere of Bracebridge Hall.'' Each course begins with a whimsical prelude. When the boar's head and the Baron of the Beef are presented to a lavishly dressed <PERSON> Squire </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracebridge </PERSON>, played by a stout local actor, the baron is knighted Sir Loin. The diners, seated at large round tables, get more into the spirit of the evening as the courses progress at the base of an altar-like head table. The squire and his cast of characters, including the jester and a dancing bear, lead the revelry and are presented each course for approval, with song. The dinner, billed as semi-formal to formal, grows more effervescent as it progresses from peacock pie -LRB- crepe of goose with juniperberry sauce -RRB- to boar's head -LRB- roast sirloin of beef -RRB- to plum pudding with hard sauce. To be eligible for the dinner drawing, one has to plan ahead. The deadline for the 1988 Christmas dinners was Jan. 15. To receive an application for next year, call or write <ORGANIZATION> Reservations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dept. </ORGANIZATION>, Attention: Bracebridge Dinner, <LOCATION> Yosemite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Curry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 5410 <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ave. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 There's no longer a need to whine about the cork that accidentally falls into the wine bottle. Cork retrievers are available, generally for less than $ 10. Some other wine accessories: _ Thermocool, with vacuum-sealed double sides available in contemporary or crystal cut, will keep the wine bottle cold for hours. _ Vacu-vin will keep open wine fresh for days, by removing most of the oxygen in the bottle. _ A champagne key helps remove champagne corks easily and quickly. A small air pump is an alternative.

 For the some who like it hot, there are now more than 300 brands of Mexican hot sauce available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If you're from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, that sauce probably is salsa. For Texans, it's most likely picante sauce. Easterners often choose taco sauce. These saucy tidbits come from <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Sands </PERSON>, vice president of sales and marketing for Pace Foods, who says that sale of Mexican sauces reached $ 271 million in 1987, more than double the figure of 1980. About 30 percent of all Mexican food eaten in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is consumed in <LOCATION> Californian </LOCATION>, he says, followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Most popular is picante sauce, which accounts for 40 percent of the market, according to Find-SVP, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market research firm. Picante is a thin sauce with pieces of jalapenos, tomatoes and onions. Second is salsa, a thicker sauce often made with milder green or anaheim chilis, followed by taco sauce, usually flavored with red or cayenne pepper, and the gravy-like enchilada sauce.

 A more casual alternative to a holiday formal dinner party is the dessert buffet, with coffees and cognac. Some suggestions: Plan to serve three to four desserts for 10 to 15 guests, four to five desserts for a group of 20 or 25. Mix mugs with coffee cups and pull out the extra plates from the cupboard. A tray of three or four varieties of cognac, French brandy, eases the need for an elaborate bar setup. Another idea is to add alcohol to the hot coffee and top it with whipped cream and garnish. For cafe Italiano, add an ounce of amaretto; for <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> coffee, an ounce of Irish Mist; <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coffee calls for an ounce of <LOCATION> Kahlua </LOCATION> and half-an-ounce of rum, and <PERSON> Kioki </PERSON> coffee is made with an ounce of <LOCATION> Kahlua </LOCATION> and an ounce of brandy.

 Supermarket produce counters are taking on a special look these days, with bean sprouts, bok choy, guava and other exotic items catching the eye of food shoppers, says an Agriculture Department economist. `` Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part of the new up-scale image of many produce sections,'' says <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she says. On the average, Americans consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year, up 12 percent since 1972. That is a farm weight equivalent before trimming, processing and after-harvest losses, she says. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, writing in the agency's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, said there are a number of reasons. `` Americans have become more health conscious, eating lots of fruits and vegetables as part of a well-balanced diet,'' she said. `` Consequently, we want a huge selection of produce.'' Further, Americans travel more frequently than they used to, and many want `` foreign'' foods when they return home. `` Unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant menus,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. `` Also influencing our diets are recent immigrants from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> who have brought their native foods with them.'' A survey conducted for a trade journal, The <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, showed the most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa and bean sprouts, followed by snow peas, pearl onions, parsnips, leeks, baby vegetables, Chinese cabbage and shallots. Moreover, about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard of less widely known specialty vegetables such as Belgian endive, bok choy, celeriac, daikon, kohlrabi, parsley root and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> artichoke. The most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits, in order, were pomegranates, persimmons, kumquats, quince and guavas. Additionally, at least a third of those surveyed had seen or heard of breadfuit, passion fruit, plantains, prickly pear and red bananas. But some fruits were nearly unkown: Asian pears, carambolas, cherimoyas, sapotes, radiccho and rappini.

 The stock market struggled to a modest gain Friday, encouraged by hopes for a steadier dollar. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.96 points to 2,062.41. For the second straight day, the dollar was bolstered by central bank intervention. Gold prices weakened. Bond prices turned upward after a week of declines triggered by the falling dollar. Precious metals futures retreated while copper futures gained; livestock and meat were lower; grains and soybeans were mixed; oil futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Up Against Yen, Share Prices Continue Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar inched up against the Japanese yen today in cautious trading following last week's concerted central bank interventions, while share prices continued to rise on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 122.52 yen, up 0.12 yen from Friday's close of 122.40 yen. Opening at 122.40 yen, the currency moved within a tight range of 122.37 yen to 122.60 yen. `` The dollar-yen rate did n't move very much today mainly because market players have become extremely cautious after the intervention by world's major central banks Thursday and Friday,'' said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Investors were selling the dollar less, but very few people were interested in buying the currency,'' he said, adding that it was not dollar-buying interest that saved the dollar from falling further but cautiousness over the central bank intervention. Dealers said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> did not intervene today. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 103.39 points to close at a record high of 29,180.20 Friday, added 104.06 points or 0.36 percent to finish at a new record of 29,284.26. The Nikkei rose 119.00 points shortly after the market opened, and managed to maintain the gain, rising for the seventh straight session since Nov. 11. `` Financial issues attracted participants largely because of the yen's strength against the dollar,'' said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. `` But on the other hand, many market players were quite afraid that share prices were getting too high,'' the dealer said, asking he not be identified. In moderate trading, volume was estimated at 850 million shares.

 The dollar was mixed and trading in a narrow range in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today, with the fear of central bank intervention dampening business, foreign currency dealers said. Gold prices were little changed. Traders in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> said the market remains bearish about the dollar's near-term propects. But they said the market also appears determined to send President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a clear warning that something must be done quickly to cut the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and federal government spending. `` The market does n't want to wait until Jan. 20,'' when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is inaugurated, said one trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>. Most of the world's major central banks bought dollars in several rounds of coordinated interventions Thursday and Friday, halting a rapid decline in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. `` The interventions of the past days have boosted the dollar only temporarily, but caution is still recommended,'' said the chief dealer at a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> bank. `` If one believes that the dollar will weaken, the central banks are likely to come in again.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.12 yen to a closing 122.52. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 122.50 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.7362 West German marks, up from 1.7360; 1.4585 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.9315 French francs, down from 5.9340; 1.9575 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9610; 1,290.65 Italian lire, down from 1,293.75; 1.2145 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2343 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.8150, compared with $ 1.8160 Friday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 416.75 a troy ounce, down from $ 417.75 bid late Friday. At midmorning Monday, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 416.60 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 416.50, down from $ 417.80 bid late Friday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell 33 cents to close at a bid $ 418.79.

<HEAD>New Federal Flight Limits Threaten To Add To Holiday Delays</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Getting over the river and through the woods to the family Thanksgiving feast via <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> _ always a challenge _ may be even tougher this year because of new federal flight limits. And things do n't look much better for Christmas, say travel agents, airline and aviation officials. `` We're routinely advising our customers and clients of the, let's say, congestion problems at major airports, particularly <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> vice president. The new <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> limits on the number of flights allowed to arrive at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> in a given hour are likely to aggravate the problem at the nation's busiest airport. Following a startling 150 percent increase in the number of errors by air traffic controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> this year, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in October ordered the airport to cut the number of arrivals from 96 per hour to 80 per hour between peak-travel times of 4:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. While the cutbacks, called a `` flow control program,'' were designed to make skies safer, airlines acknowledge they also have increased tardiness in a system in which delays never were uncommon. `` We have seen a definite impact from the flow control program,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the second-largest carrier at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. `` To give some example, in October of 1987 at O'Hare we were above 95 percent in our arrivals within 15 minutes. That dropped to about 75 percent in October of this year.'' Airlines also no longer have a reserve of planes to help accommodate heavy holiday traffic, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. While the number of flights over the holiday wo n't be up much _ about 2,300 total arrivals and departures per day _ the number of people in the skies will be, as airlines see their planes filled to capacity. Stack anticipates that sometime over the four-day Thanksgiving weekend, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> will top its previous one-day record of more than 30,000 passengers flown out of <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. `` Passengers ought to look forward to having some delays,'' both in the air and on the ground, he said, adding that Sunday may be worst of all. `` People can choose a variety of days to begin vacation, but pretty much they wind up returning on that Sunday.'' Assuming clear skies, the airlines said travelers should find the delays manageable, but if the weather declines to cooperate, everything is up for grabs. `` Sixty percent of your delays are related to weather,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> limitations were imposed after the number of controller errors reached 30, far exceeding the 12 reported at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> in all of 1987. Four of the errors occurred over a period of a week, <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said. Even with the new limits, `` there's no perfect flow control,'' <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> said. `` Some hours we'll take 82 -LRB- arrivals per hour -RRB-. We are liberal with the 80 an hour when it has to be.'' Some feel the cutbacks do n't go far enough. `` The airlines schedule so many fights at certain times in and out ... that the airport ca n't handle them,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuler </PERSON>, a controller at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> and a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's only so many taxiways the aircraft can be on.'' <PERSON> Shuler </PERSON> said the long-term solution is 30 more controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. The short-term answer for travelers? `` Avoid key peak times and do n't put off travel plans till the last minute,'' said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Economic Problems Are Having Deep Social Impact, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Severe economic problems aggravated by the costs of apartheid are causing a spread of hunger, disease and unemployment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a prominent research organization reports. The South African Institute of Race Relations, an independent group with a reputation for impartial research, said in its annual survey on Sunday that `` the effects of economic decline pervade the picture of South African society.'' Housing experts estimate that 7 million of the nation's 26 million blacks live in shacks, the report said. It quoted the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tuberculosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as reporting that the disease, although preventable, was killing 10 people a day. The institute cited a university study forecasting that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> could have a surplus of 9 million unskilled workers without jobs by the year 2000 unless the economy is revitalized. Unemployment estimates among blacks range from 20 percent to 50 percent, though reliable figures are not available. `` Economic problems continue to be exacerbated by expenditure on segregated structures, and by the government's failure to meet black political demands,'' the report said. It referred to a recent speech by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in which he said the government's plans to eliminate inequalities in social services were being disrupted by foreign sanctions and embargoes in protest of apartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in national affairs. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the `` campaign of economic war being waged against us'' could deprive the government of $ 400 million for social programs over the next five years and delay their implementation by 10 to 15 years. The race relations institute cited estimates that the government wasted $ 400 million each year operating racially segregated health services. Government health officials reported widespread malnutrition problems, and Operation Hunger, a private group, said it was feeding 1.2 million <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> a day, according to the institute's report The report said economic problems had sidetracked a longstanding government promise to equalize per-pupil spending at black and white schools. This initiative has been stalled because the country's annual economic growth rate is now 2.5 percent, instead of the projected 4.1 percent rate on which the plan was based, the report said Of government spending on education, 41 percent went to white schools, although only 11 percent of the students were white, the report said. It said the government acknowledged that white school facilities were underutilized but was reluctant to let them be used to alleviate serious overcrowding in black schools. The government says it is committed to tax reform, deregulation, privatization and social improvements for blacks. But it is not willing to remove the budgetary duplication created by segregated schools and hospitals and by the country's 13 separate administrations, divided into white, mixed-race, Asian and 10 black homelands. South Africans also are feeling the harsh effects of economic measures taken by the government to counter the 13.3 percent annual inflation. The measures include higher tariffs for imported luxury goods. In addition, the country faces a foreign debt that is expected to reach almost $ 12 billion in 1990-91 and is equivalent to about half its export earnings. In another development Sunday, newspapers reported that the three main white, anti-apartheid political parties will launch a unified party on Dec. 14 to challenge <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The merger would involve the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by corporate executive <PERSON> Zach </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> defector <PERSON> Wynand </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>; and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by the former ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON>.

 The older television grows, the more juvenile it becomes. Delirious in a fact-based fever, TV sets are boiling over with playground pranks and True Detective docudramas. From <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s scuffle with wanna-be <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to the slow-mo misdeeds on `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' television has rarely been so revolting and so riveting at the same time. The new splurge of reality programming has critics shaking their heads and viewers crowding living room sofas. And as long as the ratings soar, a whole lot more truth-is-stranger-than-fiction series will be hurtling your way. Which is why reality champion <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is riding high. `` I do think we're on to something,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer `` ` The Reporters' is not a carbon copy of anything else. ... And I think ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted' is an honestly moving show.'' In fact, these shows owe a lot to previous programs: `` The Reporters'' can be seen as merely `` 60 Minutes'' on a caffeine jag, the crime shows as simply borrowing from the headlines more directly than did `` Hill Street Blues'' or `` St. Elsewhere.'' Imitators are lining up. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has added `` Unsolved Mysteries'' to its schedule, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> started `` High Risk'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> has resurrected `` That's Incredible'' and added the trilogy of `` Scandals,'' `` Crimes of the Century'' and `` Trackdown.'' Meanwhile, television syndicators are pounding the pavement for `` On Trial'' `` Group One Medical,'' `` Tabloid,'' `` Exclusive,'' `` Crimewatch Tonight,'' `` Crime Diaries,'' `` $ Reward $'' and `` Inside Edition.'' The popularity springs from a cast of characters more varied and bizarre than any sitcom. In one corner are the hyperactive talk-show hosts _ <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> with his broken nose and the cluster-bomb of <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> with all of their needling queries. These four ask the questions we only dream about posing. The other corner is filled with the marginally less egotistical `` journalists'' who would recreate the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> assassination if there were a rating point in it. Led by <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Povich </PERSON> on <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s syndicated `` A Current Affair'' and its rape and murder replay show, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' the key here is to sit the audience down next to the corpse, smack in the middle of the crime scene. Wherever reality programs fail in subtlety and substance, they click in thrills and ratings. Costing a fraction of traditional comedies and dramas, these unpredictable programs have in some instances doubled <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s audience share _ 15 percent of the nation's sets tune in `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted. Overall, the audience is clearly substantial: <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, nose broken but self-importance intact, is soaring from publicity generated from his talk-show brawl and his <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> hit `` Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground.'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, the carnival barker of television journalism, even went so far as to slap a promotional teaser on the slugfest edition of `` Geraldo'': `` Parents, be advised that the language and violence contained makes this show inappropriate for small children.'' In other words, kids, watch this! Why are audiences lapping it up? `` American television viewers are tired of watching the most inoffensive programming,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendle </PERSON>, executive vice president of <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s entertainment division. `` They have said, ` We do n't want another network. Give us something different.' And we're pulling out all the stops. And how. Mixing sometimes sensational celebrity gossip and lurid crime stories with first-person journalism, `` The Reporters'' does n't just penetrate the `` fourth wall,'' it runs through it into your home. Future <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> shows may be even more personal. Among ideas in the hopper for <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s third night of programming -LRB- planned for Mondays sometime next year -RRB- is `` Cops,'' a graphic documentary series about a group of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> police officers making arrests and handling dead bodies. Another Fox program in development will try to build on detective magazines, with private eyes talking up their most interesting cases with the help of video recreations. `` They -LRB- Fox -RRB- have shown that there's an insatiable thirst for real life among the television viewing audience,'' said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. `` They are filling a void that the networks are leaving. ... I think that ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted' has really hit a nerve. It's populist TV at its most pragmatic.'' So much flotsam clogs the reality genre that some players are now trying to rise above it all. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clooney </PERSON>, host of the courtroom highlight show `` On Trial,'' recently sent reporters a letter saying, `` By some unimaginable stretch of probabilities, a few writers equate such programs as ` <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON>' and ` <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>' with ` On Trial.' Nothing could be further from the truth!'' The letter was mailed one day after an `` On Trial'' publicist asked that the show be included in any upcoming stories on tabloid television. As with most anything else, too much of a good thing can be risky. If the reality-based programming crumples overnight, so, too, might <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` While it's great now, we'll be careful,'' <PERSON> Diller </PERSON> said. `` If we're not very careful about the diet, we'll make terrible mistakes.''

Falling crude prices have been a boon to many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refiners, while hurting production operations. The <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arabian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the kingdom's oil industry, recently launched a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to refine and market petroleum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` The American market is big and there is still more to it, while there is the very big market in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and we as processors of oil must storm these markets and ... guarantee marketing outlets for Saudi crude oil,'' <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said in the interview, broadcast Sunday. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> also mentioned plans for similar deals in European and Japanese markets, noting that prices of refined products remain steady despite fluctuating crude prices. `` In case the price of crude oil drops, the income would be compensated somewhat through preserving the price levels of refined products,'' he said. Declining oil prices since 1982 have meant six straight years of budget deficits in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the biggest producer among the 13 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has the world's largest oil reserves. The current world oil glut has forced prices down to about $ 13 a barrel, well below the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> benchmark price of $ 18. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said the kingdom's oil development strategy `` would be lacking if it did not comprise all stages of the industry starting from the wellhead and ending with the gasoline station.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> deal gave the kingdom a 50 percent stake in three <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> refineries and nearly 12,000 service stations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was the first major Saudi attempt to guarantee outlets for its crude oil. <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said in the television interview that the deal guaranteed sales of 600,000 barrels per day. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s current <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production quota is 4.34 million barrels per day. Revamping the Saudi oil industry also includes measures to improve profits at the state-run refining and marketing company Petrofin, <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said. Petrofin controls all but one of the kingdom's six oil refineries, operates three lubricants plants and distributes and exports refined products <PERSON> Petrofin </PERSON> also controls exploration and development of non-oil mineral resources such as bauxite, the raw material for aluminum, and gold. `` The aim is to convert all of <PERSON> Petrofin </PERSON>'s tasks to profit centers that bring additional revenue to the state and then to reduce the expenditure costs in <ORGANIZATION> Petromin </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Nazer </PERSON> said. He said savings of 500 million riyals -LRB- $ 133 million -RRB- already have been made.

<HEAD>Tobacco: Marketing Officials Optimistic As Burley Season Opens</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Despite a third straight year of drought, officials say the burley tobacco going to market today will be larger and higher in quality than last year's crop. The market opens this week in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and seven other states, and marketing officials are cautiously predicting that farmers will have a better selling season this year than last year. `` I think the price average will be up, but that will mainly be because of the higher quality,'' said <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who operates the two tobacco warehouses in <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> with his father. Last year, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> burley prices averaged $ 150.87 per hundred pounds, down from the previous season's average of $ 156.01. This season's federal price support average will be $ 1.50 a pound, up by slightly more than 1 cent. By grades, the support will range from 98 cents to $ 1.63, the same as last season. `` It's looking a lot better than it did in July before the rains came,'' said Ed French of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal-State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. A larger crop is expected this year because of more planted acreage and slightly higher yields, he said The Nov. 1 crop survey estimates the crop at 538.9 million pounds for the eight-state burley belt, up from last year's 486.6 million pounds. Yields are projected at 2,043 pounds an acre, up from 1,943 pounds last year. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s burley crop is expected to total 15.3 million pounds, up from 14.1 million last year. Yields are projected at 1,800 pounds an acre, slightly more than last year's 1,785 pounds. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> produces more than half the total crop. <PERSON> Burley </PERSON> tobacco is also grown in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. French said it would be difficult to estimate whether demand for the burley crop would be as strong as for this year's flue-cured tobacco crop. `` Everyone seems to be optimistic,'' he said. But, he added, such optimism can fade quickly if farmers are disappointed with prices on opening day. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, who is operating both tobacco warehouses in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> this season, said she is encouraged by the favorable comments from government graders and a couple of buyers who watched farmers bring in tobacco last week. `` They are looking at it as a very desirable crop,'' she said. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, sales will open today at markets in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, with the <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> market beginning sales Tuesday.

 Stock prices slumped today amid persistent worries about the dollar and interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.91 to 2,050.50 in the first half hour of trading. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 241 up, 513 down and 398 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 15.86 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. After falling sharply since the election early this month, the dollar steadied late last week as central banks of the industrialized countries intervened to support it. But analysts said many investors remained skeptical that the dollar would be able to continue strengthening on its own. At the same time, brokers said, many participants were taking a gloomy view of the market outlook, in part because of the competitive allure of short-term interest-bearing investments sporting yields of close to 8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 3 -LCB- to 19 | in the over-the-counter market Late Friday the company said its revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter would fall short of third-quarter levels because of soft orders for its 80386 microprocessor chip.

 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in July 1986, plans to ask a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to grant an eighth extension to give it time to work out a reorganization proposal, company officials said. In response to the proposed request, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> creditors have told the court they reject the company's reorganization plan and will agree to only one more extension, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, attorney representing bank creditors of the aerospace division, told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. Attorneys for creditors of the parent company declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> faces a growing number of dissenting creditors who claim its original proposal for settlement is unacceptable or are unhappy with the length of negotiations. Aerospace creditors on Thursday renewed protests to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s Nov. 7 request for extension and asked the court for the right to present a separate reorganization proposal. `` The talks are totally stalled. There is no progress, no movement at all,'' said <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> has argued it needs time to work out the complex case, which involves some 32,000 creditors of the aerospace and steel conglomerate. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> has `` made very substantial progress,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. `` You would hardly expect 32,000 claims to be resolved in such a short time.''

The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group for lawyers who handle personal injury lawsuits, contends that many of the problems mentioned in <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>'s ads were resolved through the state's 1986 `` tort reform'' law, which sets limits on damages in personal injury lawsuits <PERSON> Kezer </PERSON> said he is still weighing the issue of misrepresentation versus <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>'s First Amendment right to speak out on issues. `` It's not just black and white,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign, ongoing in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, highlights what the Connecticut-based company claims is a growing abuse of the nation's court system by people trying to make money via lawsuits. The ads complain that abusive lawsuits are costing insurance companies too much money and that the public is paying for it through higher insurance rates. They ask concerned parties to call a toll-free number. <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON>, president of the lawyers' association, said the 1986 <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> law made important changes aimed at ending frivolous suits and other abuses in the state's civil justice system. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruthers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>'s director of corporate communications, said the company wants to make people as aware of lawsuit abuse `` as they are of littering and drunken driving.'' He said the ad campaign is different from the sort of campaign waged in 1986 when the state's tort reform was passed. At that time, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> was trying to reach business leaders and elected officials. Now, he said, the company is taking its case to the people. In some cases, tort reform and other civil statutes are being challenged, which is one reason for the campaign, he said. The company is planning to expand the $ 800,000 test market to a nationwide newspaper-and-radio advertising campaign.

<TEXT>
 The number of working oil and gas rigs jumped by 26 this week to 923, rebounding from a sharp plunge in the previous week, industry watcher <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported. The increase continues to reflect an unstable trend in the rig count, which last week dropped by 45 to total 897. A year ago the count was 1,152, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Monday. The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an oil toolmaker company that merged with <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has kept track of the number of working rigs since 1940. In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures. The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2. Among major oil producing states, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> posted the biggest gain with 16 additional rigs, followed by <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, 10; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, two; and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, one each. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had the biggest decline with 3 fewer rigs, followed by <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, with two each. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was unchanged for the week.

<TEXT>
 The nation's economy will grow for the seventh straight year in 1989, despite a federal budget deficit that will swell to $ 170 billion, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> study released on Monday. The bank's 1989 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outlook </ORGANIZATION> said there will be no recession, even though economic growth will slow to 2.7 percent from 1988's 3.8 percent. `` The annual growth rate, however, masks weaknesses in the economy, which will become evident in the last half of 1989,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the bank's chief economist. After a strong growth rate in the first quarter, the result of bouncing back from the 1988 drought, `` economic growth will slow to under 2 percent for the remainder of the year,'' the study said. `` The most serious economic policy challenge that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will face is the federal budget deficit, even though both the politicians and the general public are suffering from battle fatigue on this issue,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Inflation will increase to 4.9 percent from 4.1 percent in 1988 while the unemployment rate will be around 5.5 percent next year. Wage gains are expected to increase an average of 4.3 percent compared to 3.3 percent, the forecast said. As a result, consumer prices will be 0.7 of a percentage point higher in 1989 due to wage pressures.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted today that `` I'm not going to change my view'' on how to keep the deficit down, despite a congressional report saying his proposed `` flexible freeze'' on spending wo n't solve the problem of the federal government's burgeoning red ink. `` I'm under no illusions about the simplicity of all of this. I'm determined to get that budget deficit down ... -LRB- but -RRB- I ca n't get discouraged every time somebody comes out with yet another report,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a news conference announcing three personnel appointments, including that of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide and deputy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, as budget director A report over the weekend by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, concluded that a spending freeze alone would not fix the deficit, which stood at $ 150 billion in the budget year that ended Sept. 30. The report said that tax increases and cuts in defense and Social Security must be considered to slash the budget deficit and for the new administration to have `` any flexibility to pursue its own policy agenda'' and for the economy to regain its vigor. Specifically, the report, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` can not ` freeze' our way out of the problem.'' During his presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeateldy rejected higher taxes and advocted a `` flexible freeze'' on spending. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said earlier today on `` CBS This Morning'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will probably have to reassess his economic assumptions once he gets into office and will `` submit his own budget, which will reflect the new realities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he would indeed `` sit down with my budget director and go into exactly where we stand on all these numbers.'' But, he added, `` I do n't think there's been any dramatic change in the figures we've been dealing with. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> seems to come out with reports periodically, but I will be persuaded much more by what my budget director tells me is the reality than by their reports.'' `` I'm open minded in terms of hearing from all these people ... but I'm not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit down,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I spelled out a program ... -LRB- that was -RRB- endorsed by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. I do n't remember any Republicans or Democrats running on a please-raise-my-taxes program,'' he said. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, who is leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairmanship in the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the Democratic leadership will support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he comes up with a plan to meet his stated priorities of reducing the deficit without new taxes while preserving national defense and important programs like <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, education, clean air, and the anti-drug effrt. `` The question is making sure we have the right numbers and the right kind of assumptions,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said.

 Negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> and its unionized editorial employees resumed this morning, hours before a threatened walkout by the writers, editors, photographers and support staff. A strike deadline of 2:30 p.m. CST today was set by the negotiating committee of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 71, though the deadline could be changed, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, the newspaper's religion writer and a union spokesman Talks resumed at 9 a.m., said <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Soll </PERSON>. But he added that `` at this time, it looks like 2:30 would be as far as we can go.'' <PERSON> Soll </PERSON> said newspaper negotiators were willing to meet around the clock, and that he hoped the talks would be fruitful. `` There appears to be much less anguish and much more hope'' among negotiators on both sides, he said. Salary remained the main sticking point. The Sun-Times' negotiators `` have not yet made their final offer,'' <PERSON> Soll </PERSON> said, adding he expected that offer to be made at today's meeting. Union leaders met late Sunday night and agreed to accept the company proposal for a bargaining session today. `` We'll keep negotiating until we have a settlement or until we hit the strike deadline, and then we're out of there,'' said <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gericke </PERSON>, a copy editor and member of the negotiating committee for the union, which represents 250 reporters, editors, photographers and support staff. `` We decided to give it every shot,'' he said. A strike by <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> editorial workers would be the first in the newspaper's 40-year history. <PERSON> Soll </PERSON> said management did not want a strike, but is `` fully prepared to produce a paper'' using company executives, non-union editors and outside writers. He said the newspaper would continue putting out its three daily editions. Union members have been working without a contract since June 1. As the strike deadline approached, guild unit chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said the union would walk out if the company continued to refuse to offer a pay raise. The guild has been seeking a 19.5 percent pay raise over three years, while management's latest proposal was for a 3 percent salary cut for 18 months, followed by a restoration of current pay levels for the remainder of the three-year pact, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. `` We've got to have pay raises in the contract for this to be settled,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said, differences remained over management proposals to cut night differential for workers by 40 percent and exempt eight senior editorial staffers from union jurisdiction. <PERSON> Soll </PERSON> said `` the paper is healthy financially'' but must control its costs to remain competitive with the larger <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, which has an estimated circulation of 765,000 daily and 1.117 million Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>, whose circulation is estimated at 605,000 daily and 614,000 on Sunday, was purchased from <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> media baron <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for $ 145 million in June 1986 by a group of investors led by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Adler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Shaykin </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Thailand Seeks to Turn Indochina Battlefields into Marketplaces</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than a dozen years after communist victories in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is hoping to turn its adversaries next door into trading partners and battlefields into lucrative marketplaces. Calling for increased commerce with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> businessmen see potential in markets shunned by their hardline government. As <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> liberalizes its underdeveloped economy, Thai businessmen and some legislators worry that if they act too slowly, others will corner a market <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is in a favorable geographic position to penetrate. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> already ply those markets, each drawing about $ 300 million a year in a low profile but brisk trade. Among other competitors in the region are <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, himself a businessman, started talking about improving general relations with <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> as well as exploring economic opportunities shortly after taking office last August. `` Battlefields into marketplaces,'' has become one of the slogans of the new government. Thai businessmen are angling for fishing licenses in rich Vietnamese waters and sending agricultural experts to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> to supervise an experimental farm while importing timber from that country. Laotians shop at a Thai-run department store in the heart of the capital of <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> and a Thai company recently entered into the first major joint venture investment project in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the construction of a garment factory. But officially <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has thus far had no government-to-government economic transactions with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s troops invaded neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> policy has been one of putting pressure on <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> in all fields. The Thai government also offers no help to private entrepreneurs doing business with <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, but generally turns a blind eye to the vast black market trade across its borders with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` We have lost time and lost out to countries that actively traded with <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> regardless of their government's strong opposition to Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wongse </PERSON> <PERSON> Polnikorn </PERSON>, a onetime deputy foreign minister and currently chairman of a Thai company that will import timber from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and set up a cash crop farm in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> decreed that the number of goods officially banned for export to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> be halved to 30 in advance of his recent visit to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the first by a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> prime minister since 1979, government spokesman <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yodmani </PERSON> said. Since the 1975 communist victory, periodic skirmishes _ as well as two major confrontations _ have erupted along the Thai-Laotian border. Similar clashes have occurred between Thais and Vietnamese along the Thai-Cambodian frontier. Last year, two-way trade between <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> topped $ 48 million although the black market, or `` unofficial,'' trade is known to be far higher. Two-way trade with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> rose to $ 7.5 million last year from $ 4.8 million in 1986, while Thai exports to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> were $ 400,000 in 1986. <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON>'s moves toward <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> were a `` trial balloon'' to induce <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to focus on improving its economy rather than making war. But some in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which has traditionally been suspicious of <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s long-term intentions in the region, view a prosperous <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as potentially dangerous and expansionist. `` If we can make <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> prosperous, ourselves prosperous, that's great, but what is there to guarantee that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wo n't move into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s northeast,'' <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> said in an interview `` Once it's prosperous, then it can afford to keep troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Surin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitsuwan </PERSON>, a respected member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> should at first proceed cautiously in trade with <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, a country with which it shares ethnic and cultural bonds and which poses no major security threat. He also suggested more economic dealings with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, with which official, two-way trade totaled $ 544 million in 1987. `` There are a lot of trade opportunities and untapped resources next door,'' <PERSON> Surin </PERSON> said. `` If we do n't hurry now, the degree of their dependence on us will be reduced.'' Although <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> will be hard pressed to compete with Japanese technology and funding involved in major projects, businessmen say the Thais could carve out a profitable <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> niche in areas like fishing, forestry and smaller-scale construction. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, with its economy booming and consumer spending on an upward curve, could also serve as a market for Indochinese goods. While war and mismanagement have eroded the economic infrastructure in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, the three countries possess large untapped natural resources and an abundance of cheap labor. `` We must go and explore ways we can do more and benefit from one another,'' said <PERSON> Kangwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tantiponganant </PERSON>, a businessmen involved in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Given the political sensitivities, other Thai businessmen prefer to make low-keyed trips to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, emphasizing that their interests are in `` long-term business planning.''

<HEAD>Carrying A Company's Documents Means Cheap Flights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Need a cheap ticket to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>? Are you willing to dress well for the trip, shun alcohol on the flight and do a little light delivery work? If so, you may be ready for a fast-paced career as an overseas air courier. For up to 70 percent off the cost of a regular airline ticket, couriers shuttle business documents and small parcels from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to foreign lands and back. It's all perfectly legal. For example, flying to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janiero </LOCATION> on a commercial flight from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> costs over $ 1,000, depending on the season. But Now Voyager, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> air courier booking agent, had an Election Day flight for $ 150 round-trip from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The round-trip cost of a shuttle flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> would add $ 198. `` Being a courier is very simple,'' said air courier guru <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, who has taken about 20 international flights as a courier and writes a monthly newsletter on the subject. `` You do n't have to do anything. You just have to be there.'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, 36, an Australian who has lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for 13 years, said he was working as a ground courier four years ago when `` somebody told me it was possible to fly back on the Concorde for 250 bucks. Two weeks later I was in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and I did it.'' About 20 courier companies, most based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, are battling in what has developed in the last five years into a highly competitive business. `` When this industry started if you could offer three-day service -LRB- companies -RRB- just about knelt down and kissed your feet,'' said <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, overseas director of I.B.C. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> courier company. `` Next year, I'm expecting them to demand yesterday service.'' Couriering began in the mid-1970s, but the need for speedy international business deliveries to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> did n't surge until the beginning of this decade. Many companies in the past either hired private couriers or sent their own employees _ more expensive and time-consuming than using `` civilian'' couriers, who pay to fly rather than getting paid. `` Getting things on someone's desk by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning became very important in business,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> of Now Voyager in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If you ship something by freight it can take as long as 72 hours to clear customs and is consigned to a freight terminal.'' Banks, stock brokerage houses, insurance companies, film studios _ all use air couriers regularly, typically shipping bundles of documents and bulky materials. Under a signed contract, couriers are n't responsible for the contents of their packages and typically do n't even touch them. Couriers normally pay a fee to a service _ Now Voyager charges $ 45 _ and then say when and where they want to travel, booking up to three months in advance for regular, scheduled departures and return trips on commercial airlines. Payment is the bargain ticket, usually 30 percent to 70 percent off regular fares. Couriers travel to the airport with the courier company, which checks the baggage and hands over the baggage claim receipts and, on international flights, a manifest listing contents. The courier meets another agent at the destination, and either hands over the receipts or brings the material _ packed in canvas bags bearing the courier company logo _ through customs and is free to go until the return, also usually a courier trip. So what's the catch? Couriers are permitted only a carry-on bag. Drinking alcohol is not permitted on board and couriers have to dress well. And they have to be flexible in terms of booking; most couriers are `` freelance whatevers,'' self-employed, retired, teachers or students _ but it's not impossible to schedule vacations around courier flights. Some companies are wholesalers, meaning they ship freight on contract from other couriers, usually to points not served by those couriers. For instance, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> may hire another courier to get a package to an overseas point. Most courier trips made by civilians are international _ some 85 percent on Now Voyager _ because major domestic courier companies provide their own overnight service within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>'s October newsletter listed about 100 available flights from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> _ including a $ 499 round-trip ticke to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and $ 75 round-trip to <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. Round-trip European destinations come as cheap as $ 150 to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> started an air courier company that folded, and now lectures on being a courier at `` adult education'' schools like <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s `` Learning Adventure,'' which offers classes on cooking, hang-gliding and `` How To Find A Lover.'' `` For all adventurous readers, Now Voyager has just introduced <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> as a destination,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> writes in his typewritten `` Travel Secrets,'' in which he lists available courier flights by company and even proffers vacation tips. `` At $ 250 round-trip it's a bargain, and seven days is enough time to take a side trip to the spectacular Mayan ruins at <LOCATION> Tikal </LOCATION>.''

 The stock market suffered a broad setback today amid persistent worries about the dollar and interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 17.42 to 2,044.99 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 334 up, 1,014 down and 461 unchanged. After falling sharply since the election early this month, the dollar steadied late last week as central banks of the industrialized countries intervened to support it. But analysts said many investors remained skeptical that the dollar would be able to continue strengthening on its own. Indeed, it fell today against leading foreign currencies. At the same time, brokers said, many participants were taking a gloomy view of the market outlook, in part because of the competitive allure of short-term interest-bearing investments sporting yields of close to 8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> climbed 2 -RRB- to 86 -RRB-.

 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock surged in heavy trading today after directors extended the record-sized auction for the company and disclosed they had received one tentative offer possibly more than $ 26 billion. The staggering takeover maneuvers for the food-and-tobacco giant grew even more complex Sunday when a special committee of directors evaluating offers said it was postponing the deadline for bidders until Nov. 29. The committee also disclosed that the bids received as of the first deadline last Friday not only topped all previous bids, which were in the unprecedented $ 90-a-share or $ 20 billion range, but that all were worth at least $ 94 a share or about $ 21.3 billion. The committee said one group had estimated its offer as possibly worth up to $ 118 a share or $ 26.6 billion. It further stated all previous bidders could resubmit offers, strongly suggesting the committee was n't satisfied with proposals received so far. The committee also told its own advisers to consider other types of restructuring. `` ... while no assurance can be given that any transaction will occur, the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expressed its belief that that process which it is overseeing will benefit all shareholders,'' stated <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and the head of the five-member special committee. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s stock jumped $ 2.37 -LCB- to $ 86.37 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where it was the most heavily traded stock of the morning with more than 1.44 million shares changing owners. Jostling for approval now are these proposals: _ A $ 100-a-share cash and securities offer valued at about $ 22.5 billion from a group led by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> senior management and the investment firms <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That group, which last month touched off the buyout battle with a proposed takeover, previously offered $ 92 a share, or about $ 20.7 billion, for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s 225.3 million common shares _ A $ 94-a-share cash and securities offer, with an indicated value of about $ 21.2 billion by a group led by buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which previously offered $ 90 a share, or about $ 20.3 billion _ A preliminary cash and securities proposal to sell <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s food businesses and later acquire its tobacco business separately, from a group led by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a partnership that includes <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> billionaire <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> First <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> indicated it valued the total consideration at from $ 105 to $ 118 a share. All three proposals would include a minority equity stake in the post-buyout company for current <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. `` Due to the varying potential values and nature of the consideration offered in the two bids and the proposal, and the varying terms, conditions and contingencies associated with each, the Special Committee determined not to make any recommendation at this time'' <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> stated. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> makes hundreds of consumer items ranging from <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuervo </PERSON> tequila and <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> cigarettes to Life Savers candy and Milk Bone dog snacks. Any of the latest proposals easily would be the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merger ever, topping the record $ 13.4 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by what is now <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. It was not immediately clear whether the bidders were ready to escalate the already tense takeover fight. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> stated its group `` must carefully consider our alternatives in light of new information we will be receiving before reaching any judgment on what further steps, if any, we might take.'' <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive and the leader of the management group, said he believed his group had submitted `` a winning bid,'' but gave no indication whether its proposal was subject to revision. There was no comment from the First Boston-led group. The management group offered $ 100 a share in cash for for 175 million of the company's 225.3 million outstanding common shares. The group said it would acquire the remaining shares for $ 56 cash, plus securities and common stock in the surviving company that it said would bring the total consideration to $ 100 a share. The common stock would equal about 15 percent of the surviving company's outstanding shares The new <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> proposal would pay $ 94 cash a share for about 178 million <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> shares. The remaining stock would be exchanged for preferred stock and securities the firm valued at $ 94 a share, including convertible debentures that, assuming full conversion into stock, would amount to about 25 percent of the post-buyout company's outstanding shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> and management group's offers are for a leveraged buyout, in which most of the money for the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> would be borrowed and later repaid with the comapny's cash flow or the sale of its assets. The <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION>'s preliminary proposal includes the installment sale by Dec. 31 of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s food businesses _ which accounted for about 60 percent of net sales last year, or $ 15.8 billion _ followed by the acquisition next year of the tobacco operations. The plan anticipates a purchase of the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> tobacco business for $ 15.75 billion plus the stock warrants, and the sale of the food businesses for a $ 13 billion installment note plus the right to 80 percent of the total net proceeds from the sale of food businesses that exceeded the amount of the note. Proceeds from the sale of the food operations, which analysts have estimated could total $ 12.5 billion to $ 15.5 billion, would go to shareholders. First <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> indicated the total consideration could range from $ 98 to $ 110 cash a share, plus securities and stock warrants firm valued at from $ 7 to $ 8 a share. The warrants would entitle <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to acquire up to 20 percent of the tobacco business.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor May be Liable for Another $40 Million in
Overcharges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has warned its shareholders to brace for almost $ 40 million more in fines, on top of $ 127 million the company is already paying for defrauding the government on military contracts. `` The government is continuing to pursue claims of approximately $ 39.2 million of misallocated costs plus interest,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> said in a recent third-quarter report to shareholders. The Rockford-based company is awaiting `` determination letters'' on other government contract disputes, besides those related to the $ 39.2 million, the company said. Those letters are the government's formal notification that the contractor owes it money <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said today that the additional fines mentioned in <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter report apparently involve civil issues that were not resolved by settlement of criminal charges and `` that we did not believe at the time warranted criminal prosecution.'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said the government and the company were negotiating a settlement of those issues. He would not comment further. The $ 39.2 million is nearly twice the $ 20 million <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> has left in its special account to resolve disputes involving military and other government contracts. Company spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernam </PERSON> said Friday he knows of no plans to put more money into the fund. However, investment analysts said the company probably would have to take an additional charge on earnings if <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> has to repay the entire amount. `` It sure seems like it,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Quain </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wertheim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` They have on the table less than $ 20 million. The government wants $ 40 million plus. There's no telling right now what it's going to be.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> has pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> to four counts of criminal fraud. It also pleaded guilty in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to mischarging on government contracts. The company was fined $ 115 million for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> crimes and $ 12.3 million for activities of its <ORGANIZATION> Sundstrand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The fines were the largest ever paid for government contract fraud. A federal grand jury is continuing to look into possible criminal charges against company employees.

 Considering how tight your local banker seems to be when you approach him for a loan, there is a bit of a mystery why so many billions of dollars in loans have gone astray. A few items underscore the mystery of how so many `` experts'' in finance could have made so many financial blunders on large loans while riding herd on tiny ones. Consider these developments in the banking arena: _ Some of the country's most prestigious banks are in the process of writing down hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to less developed nations that may never be repaid Some banks already have collapsed. During 1987, more than 200 insured banks were closed or kept open only with emergency aid at a cost to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Desposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 2.1 billion. That figure may not depict the true situation. At the end of 1987 close to 1,600 insured banks were on the problem list, nearly four times the number at the end of 1982, when the economy was emerging into a long expansion. _ The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> recently won congressional approval of a $ 14 billion authorization, the better to make loans to less developed nations that are unable to handle their existing loans to commercial banks _ The cost of restructuring the savings and loan industry's finances, ruined by bad loans, could eventually cost taxpayers between $ 20 billion and $ 100 billion, since the taxpayers are the insurers of such _ The President's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Privatization </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this year that the delinquency rate on federal loans was 8 percent, or three times that on private loans It said the delinquency amounts to $ 24 billion. In just one area, the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, the commission estimated that defaults will reach about $ 12 billion by 1990. `` There is broad agreement that federal lending agencies have been ineffective as loan managers,'' the panel said. It could have been said also about private sector lenders. The status of loans, public and private, strains credibility _ and things are not improving. The latest craze is for lenders to toss billions of dollars at corporate raiders of some of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest companies Is the new debt secure? Have the loan officers scrutinized the applicants? Are they exercizing their obligations to protect the depositors, whose money it is? If they lose the money will it be necessary for Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> to rescue them? Somehow, critics are saying, a sense of responsibility and accountability seems to have been lost. Too often, they say, the costs of the bad loans are borne by the public, in taxes, rather than by the culprits, in their wallets. Why this should be so is debatable, but federal insurance programs may have something to do with it. The ability to juggle the books _ that is, maintain as an asset a loan everyone knows will not be collected _ may be another reason. But no answer whatever is likely to satisfy the small borrower with an unblemished credit record who has to mortgage the house in order to get a loan to repair the roof. To him, and others, the mystery can not be penetrated.

<HEAD>EEC Commissioner Calls for Joint Merger Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s competition commissioner said Monday it was essential that the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> states forge a joint merger control policy. `` National laws are simply not adequate to deal with cross-border mergers, in particular those which may have an effect upon the Community as a whole,'' Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> said in a speech. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> states agreed to empower the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to consider corporate mergers in advance, and maybe block them. But the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is seeking the power to rule on mergers exceeding a billion European currency units, which are worth about $ 1.19 billion, in annual revenue. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> want that limit raised. Urging speedy adoption of a merger control policy, <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> said differing national rules on mergers which may lead to conflicting decisions. `` This is a severe handicap for the companies concerned who are entitled to expect greater legal certainty and more rapid procedures,'' he said. He said companies increasingly view the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> countries as `` their home market. It is now widely acknowledged that if the economic objectives underpinning the single market strategy are to be achieved, a streamlined Community merger control mechanism must be available.'' <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> spoke at a conference organized by the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to knock down trade barriers among its member nations by Dec. 31, 1992. He said while the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members adopted a modest airline deregulation plan in 1987, `` we have to go further.'' He said the Commission has begun drafting proposals for a second stage of liberalization. These will deal with ending curbs on capacity and prices and freeing air carriers of the system of slot allocation at airports that now favors major airlines at the expense of smaller competitors, <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> said. He said the Commission also planned to tackle air transportation agreements between <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> nations and other countries. `` There is now a good case for the negotiation of air service agreements between the Community and other nations ... The present network of bilateral agreements has resulted in an unduly rigid international air transport system,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell against all major currencies in European trading Monday amid continued anxiety about the American budget deficit. Gold prices declined. Currency dealers said the dollar was hurt by remarks from President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirming that he wo n't raise taxes to narrow the huge gap. At issue is whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic-controlled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can agree on spending cuts needed to trim the deficit. Dealers also reported a lack of central-bank intervention Monday to prop up the dollar's exchange rate as there had been last week. One trader said the dollar can not maintain its current exchange rates without central bank buying. The Canadian dollar gained more than two cents in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar on the heels of Saturday's opinion polls predicting victory in Monday's Canadian general election for Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Conservatives. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Monday, one British pound cost $ 1.8175, more expensive for buyers than Friday's late $ 1.8160. Other late rates compared with late rates Friday: 1.7305 West German marks, down from 1.7360; 1.4575 Swiss francs, down from 1.4585; 5.9305 French francs, down from 5.9340; 1.9550 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9610; 1,288.62 Italian lire, down from 1,293.75; and 1.2117 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2343. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begains, the dollar closed at 122.52 Japanese yen, up from 122.40 late Friday. But in late <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading the dollar fell lower to 122.20 yen. Gold bullion closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major European market, at $ 416.75 a troy ounce, down from $ 417.75 bid late Friday.

<HEAD>Japan Steelmaker Buying Part of Armco Steel Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and a major Japanese steelmaker Monday announced their intention to form a joint venture to operate <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>'s Eastern Steel Division. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boni </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kawasaki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reached agreement in principle to form the venture to jointly manage and operate the Middletown-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>'s steel mills in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, Ky. The division employs 13,800 people, has annual sales of about $ 1.5 billion and annual production capacity of approximately 3.5 million tons of steel. The proposed terms of the joint venture provide for <ORGANIZATION> Kawasaki </ORGANIZATION> to purchase 40 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> Division for about $ 350 million with <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> retaining the rest. Language in the agreement allows for the two companies to negotiate an increase in <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION>'s investment in the venture up to a maximum of 50 percent, officials said. The proposed venture would assume the debts and employee benefit obligations related to the division's operation. <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> said the joint venture would provide new steelmaking technology for <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>'s carbon steel business, would give the Japanese steelmaker a stake in a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel company and would allow the two firms to better serve Japanese automakers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are enthusiastic about the prospects for this venture because it would allow us to add some of the world's best new technology to our already announced plans to modernize and improve our two largest flat-rolled carbon steel plants,'' <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> said in a statement. The modernization plan includes quality and productivity improvements at both <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern Steel makes a broad range of carbon flat-rolled steels for the automotive, appliance and construction markets. <PERSON> Boni </PERSON> said the proposed joint venture is part of <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term growth strategy. He said, `` The product and technology fit between the two companies will provide a foundation for growth that will strengthen <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>, benefit <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION> and, most importantly, better serve all our customers.'' No date was projected for completion of the agreement, but <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> officials said the two firms will complete negotiations and sign a formal agreement as soon as possible. The contract is subject to approval by the boards of directors of both companies. <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>, which maintains corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Parsippany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, produces carbon, electrical and stainless steels, steel products and oilfield machinery and equipment and is in the property and casualty insurance business. <LOCATION> Kawasaki </LOCATION> is the third largest steel producer in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Like <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION>, it is a world leader in the technology of carbon and coated steels. The company, with about 27,000 employees, has two major steel plants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and a modern research center with some 1,300 scientists and technicians. The firm has also recently diversified into semi-conductors, telecommunications, advanced materials and high performance ceramics. The firm also is part-owner of <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kawasaki </PERSON> had 1986 sales totaling about $ 6.4 billion.

<HEAD>Low Pay Hampers IRS Efforts, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In some areas of the country, the people who process your federal tax return are paid less than those who make your hamburgers, congressional auditors said Monday. The problem of low salaries was one of several cited by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in a report on how the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> might improve the tax-collection process. The report was one of a series by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, on major problems to be faced by the new president and new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` If these issues are not addressed,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> wrote, `` the -LRB- IRS -RRB- commissioner can expect -LRB- 1 -RRB- serious problems in processing tax returns, -LRB- 2 -RRB- a decline in taxpayer confidence in the tax system, and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a significant loss in tax revenues that could help reduce the deficit.'' The most pressing <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> need is modernization of the tax-processing system, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, noting the agency already has approved a basic plan that will cost several billion dollars and is expected to take 10 years to complete. `` IRS can not afford to wait until the mid-1990s for a solution to an impending computer capacity problem,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` If it does, the processing problems encountered in 1985 in processing tax returns and issuing refunds could reoccur.'' Most recommendations in the report had been made previously by the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. They include: _ Creating an agencywide plan aimed at improving <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees' ability to work effectively in an increasingly automated Low pay is a major problem. `` In some geographic areas, returns processing staff in the service centers are paid less than employees of local fast-food restaurants,'' the report said. `` <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> faces the same dilemma in trying to recruit revenue agents.'' It said that while the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> can not match the big salaries offered by some private employers, `` <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> could improve its competitive position through more modern and sophisticated recruiting.'' _ Better employee training A 1987 survey found that 57 percent of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees believed their training was inadequate. Half of a sample of letters sent to taxpayers were incorrect or unclear. And <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> workers gave the wrong answer 36 percent of the time to telephone callers who asked for advice earlier this year. _ The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> must pay more attention to the problem of tax delinquencies that now total $ 56 billion The agency estimates that $ 33 billion of that is collectible. `` Little has been done to determine why tax delinquencies occur,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. _ Cutting the growing tax gap _ taxes owed but not paid _ must be a top priority The 1988 gap was estimated at $ 87.1 billion; the figure is projected to hit $ 114 billion by 1992. <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> called for more audits _ fewer than 2 percent of returns are audited. The report also urged a new program that would match corporate tax returns with backup income documents, in the same way that individual returns already are compared with reports of wages, interest and dividends earned.

Contracts for January delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 7 cents from Friday's close to settle at $ 12.98 cents per 42-gallon barrel <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said they had not yet discussed the crucial questions of oil production, output quotas for member countries and pricing. A few hours after the meeting, the ministers resumed some of the private discussions they have been holding since late last week to try to resolve the issues separating <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The main obstacle has been <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on a production ceiling equal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Iranian Oil Minister <PERSON> Gholamreza </PERSON> <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON> met with his Algerian counterpart, <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussena </PERSON>, who appears to have become an emissary between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> countries. After the meeting, <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON> told reporters it was still too early to tell whether an agreement would be reached or not. Consultations, he said, will continue Tuesday. `` If we should -LRB- see -RRB- some proposal that is good, we accept,'' he said. The ministers want to work out a new arrangement giving each country a production quota. They want to include <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the system. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refused to join in the current accord arranged in 1986. `` I would be happier if I was inside the agreement,'' said Iraqi Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON> again said he would oppose quota parity with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The two countries have had different ceilings for some time, he said. <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have said they will not join a new quota system unless all 13 members belong. The ministers want to use the new accord to cap their runaway production and lift weak prices. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> maintains a benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel but prices have been well under that. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> told the ministers, `` As we are all aware, prices have been hovering $ 5 to $ 6 per barrel below our targeted levels for several months now.'' `` If we do not reach such an accord,'' he said, `` then I am afraid we may see a further serious erosion of these price levels, to our mutual detriment.'' <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON> said he has offered to meet with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> to work out the quota dispute. `` We can sit down to solve -LRB- the -RRB- problem -LRB- and have a -RRB- discussion about any matter,'' he said. `` I am very flexible.'' He also said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to give it a higher ceiling in any new agreement. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> needs more revenues from its oil to help rebuild after the 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will be able within a year to boost its production of oil to more than 4 million barrels a day. The country, he said, is currently pumping more than 3 million barrels a day and will boost that to about 3.3 million in a few months. Under the current production agreement, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has a ceiling of 2.4 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, although it refused to join the current accord, has an allotment of 1.5 million barrels a day. Analysts estimate that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been producing at least 2.6 million barrels a day, an amount that could soar to 3.7 million barrels in mid-1989 with completion of a new pipeline through <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to the Red Sea. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s current output accord sets total production at about 15 million barrels a day for 12 countries. Total cartel production in October was estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> at nearly 21.1 million barrels, the highest monthly level in more than five years. <PERSON> Aghazadeh </PERSON> has proposed that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> be given `` export parity'' with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. That would allow <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to have a higher overall ceiling to account for its larger internal oil demand, which it estimates at 1 million barrels a day. A possibility for resolving the dispute, analysts suggested, would be to give <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> a lower quota on paper. But the difference in the ceilings would be made up by letting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> keep a portion of the oil produced in an area called the neutral zone, which is shared by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The discussions began Thursday evening when the two <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committees _ price evolution and long-term strategy _ held formal talks. Countries belonging to those panels are <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Other members are <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report Says Regions Dependent On Manufacturing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Manufacturing jobs are growing faster in traditional service-sector areas and declining throughout the once-booming rust-belt states, according to a new report Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are among the beneficiaries of a new geographical realignment of manufacturing, the report by the business-financed research organization said. Meanwhile, manufacturing job growth is continuing to decline in states like <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, once the guts of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial heartland. `` Employment gains in the manufacturing sector this year will spread more widely than ever across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malin </PERSON>, a specialist in economic trends. `` Before the next national recession, <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> and Western states will have added substantially more manufacturing jobs than states in the North and East.'' Seven major states have added more than 738,000 manufacturing jobs since 1982, the report said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was in the lead with 228,900, followed by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> with 114,500. In the last two years, however, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> has lost 66,000 manufacturing jobs, the board said. Also gaining manufacturing jobs since 1982 were <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> 91,400; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> 90,600; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> 78,600; <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> 78,300; and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> 55,400. Among the losers were <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> with 7,300 jobs lost since 1982; <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> 29,500; <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> 34,700; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> 43,300; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> 52,000; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> 63,700; and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> 88,900. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the key to manufacturing success next year will be construction, defense spending and exports.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls On Bush Remarks About Deficit; Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar weakened Monday against major foreign currencies in the absence of central-bank buying. Gold prices also declined. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 415.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $ 1.25 from late Friday. The dollar had strengthened in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> but turned lower in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after remarks from President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirming that he wo n't raise taxes to narrow the huge federal budget deficit `` It's been a slow decline all day,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief currency dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Renewed worries about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and federal budget deficits have pushed the dollar sharply lower in recent weeks, prompting central banks around the world to buy dollars on Thursday and Friday to prop up the currency's value. But <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> and other dealers reported a lack of central-bank intervention Monday. `` The absence of internvention today allowed the dollar to ... fall; that, and the remarks from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said. At issue is whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Democratic-controlled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can agree on spending cuts needed to trim the budget deficit. If left unchecked, dealers fear, it ultimately will hurt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 122.52 Japanese yen, up from 122.40 yen late Friday. But in late <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading the dollar fell lower to 122.20 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it fell to 122.025 yen, down from 122.60 late Friday.

Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling fetched $ 1.8235, down from $ 1.8155 late Friday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday, included: 1.72815 West German marks, down from 1.7370; 1.45495 Swiss francs, down from 1.4600; 1.20695 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2300; 5.9070 French francs, down from 5.9365; and 1,284.575 Italian lire, down from 1,292.00.

The Canadian dollar gained more than two cents in European and domesitc trading against the dollar on the heels of Saturday's opinion polls predicting victory in Monday's Canadian general election for Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Conservatives On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold for current delivery fell to $ 415.80 a troy ounce from $ 417.40 late Friday.

<HEAD>Federal Probe of Blinder-Robinson Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal probe of a penny-stock brokerage firm's records continued Monday as government spokesmen declined comment on what the investigation was seeking `` I'm afraid no one can make any comment,'' said assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Zlotnick </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, where the current probe of Denver-based <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> originated. However, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Theyes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s senior vice president, on Monday said the search warrant was directed at records of 53 investors `` none of whom are present or former officers, directors, stockbrokers, or agents of <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'' and 16 publicly traded issues `` none of which were underwritten by <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>.'' `` It's their privilege to claim anything they want,'' was <PERSON> Zlotnik </PERSON>'s reply. Earlier, <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> lawyers said documents which agents for the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> were looking for had been given to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> months ago. `` We are conducting business,'' Theyes said Monday. He noted, however, that business is being conducted at about 40 percent of normal strength, in view of an agreement reached before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court judge in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> between the company and agents continuing their probe within the firm's offices. <PERSON> Theyes </PERSON> said he had about 60 staffers working Monday compared with a normal force of about 150. <PERSON> Theyes </PERSON> said he hoped the search of files would wind up Monday night. He said 24 <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> agents launched the probe with a federal search warrant Saturday morning and that by midday Monday, the agents had confined their efforts to records in storage rooms. The brokerage firm has 66 offices in 37 states nationwide and posted 1987 revenue of about $ 130 million. It specializes in penny stocks, which are cheap, high-risk securities not usually traded on major stock exchanges. <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has been the subject of earlier federal investigations involving allegations of fraud, markups and misrepresentation. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> launched a probe of <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, alleging that customers had been defrauded. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also had two other actions pending against the company, which was the nation's largest penny-stock broker. Those allegations accused the company of bookkeeping violations. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> levied penalties of $ 250,000 against the company in 1987 for charging excessive markups in the price of shares for one of its issues. The company was suspended from doing business for five days and six executives were suspended from the brokerage business for 90 days.

 The stock market turned in a sluggish, indecisive showing Monday in a session dominated by persistent worries about the dollar and interest rates. Blue-chip stocks rallied late in the day to recoup their early losses, but the rest of the market lagged behind. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 20 points at its midsesssion low, closed with a 3.56 gain at 2,065.97. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 565 up, 930 down and 477 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 120.43 million shares, against 119.32 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 142.03 million shares. After falling sharply since the election early this month, the dollar steadied late last week as central banks of the industrialized countries intervened to support it. Analysts said many investors remained skeptical, however, that the dollar would be able to continue strengthening on its own. Indeed, it fell Monday against leading foreign currencies. At the same time, brokers said, many participants were taking a gloomy view of the market outlook, in part because of the competitive allure of short-term interest-bearing investments sporting yields of close to 8 percent. Also dampening activity was the expectation of an uneventful week broken up by the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The market will be open on Friday, but the session after Thanksgiving is almost always one of the slowest of the year. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> climbed 1 ~ to 85 ~ and led the most-active list among <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> issues on turnover of more than 3.7 million Directors extended until Nov. 29 the bidding competition to acquire the company. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mattress </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 -LCB- to 15 -RRB-. On Friday the company said it was considering its possible sale, among other alternatives. In the blue-chip sector, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 28; <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> gained -RRB- to 39 ~; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> slipped -LRB- to 115 |, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was down -LRB- at 43 <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> tumbled 3 -RRB- to 19 -RCB- in the over-the-counter market. Late Friday the company said its revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter would fall short of third-quarter levels because of soft orders for its 80386 microprocessor chip. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 2.80 billion, or 0.11 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped .08 to 150.10. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell .22 to 306.14, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down .25 at 266.22 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped 2.51 to 365.07.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> requested a new hearing Monday in its attempt to oust the judge presiding over the federal civil-fraud case facing the Wall Street investment firm. In a 15-page petition to the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and other defendants asked a three-judge panel that had rejected their earlier request to rehear the matter, refer it to the entire 12-judge appellate bench or allow a separate hearing before another lower court judge. Last week, the three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to disqualify <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> from the case on grounds of conflict of interest was unwarranted.

He has said his wife's business affairs have nothing to do with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. Some lawyers familiar with the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case have said they believed the defense maneuvering is part of a broader strategy to get a more lenient judge. It was unclear how the 2nd Circuit would respond to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a rehearing on <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> Such requests are seldom granted. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is facing numerous civil charges leveled by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in September that the firm conspired with now-imprisoned speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to trade on inside information, manipulate stock and commit other frauds.

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Leap On Fresh Rumors of Ivorian-Franco Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cocoa futures prices surged Monday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on fresh rumors that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had reached an agreement to withhold large amounts of Ivorian cocoa from the world market. On other exchanges, precious-metals futures fell again; grains and soybeans were mostly higher; livestock and meat were mostly lower; oil futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Official word of a long-anticipated Ivorian cocoa withholding scheme appeared imminent Monday afternoon after a senior delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- reportedly said parties had agreed on the framework for the deal. Cocoa settled $ 30 to $ 48 higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1,425 a metric ton. But cocoa market analyst <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevenson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> cautioned that rumors of an Ivorian-Franco withholding scheme had been running rampant in the market and that nothing had been formally announced. `` That's been the situation that we've heard every day now for two weeks, yet nothing changes,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. `` Apparently something is in the works but I can only tell you it has not been confirmed by the French government.'' Under terms of a deal reported by <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000 metric tons of Ivorian cocoa would be stored in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>; 100,000 metric tons would be sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 100,000 metric tons would be sold to the Paris-based trade house <LOCATION> Sucre </LOCATION> et Denrees for gradual release onto the market. The total of 400,000 metric tons would represent more than half of the cocoa crop currently being harvested in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the world's largest cocoa producer. The Ivorians have been demanding exceptionally high premiums for their cocoa for more than a year in an attempt to bolster sagging prices worldwide, a problem caused by several years of surplus cocoa production. Unable to sell much cocoa at its high asking price, the former French colony ran out of storage space for this year's crop and appealed to the French government for assistance in withholding cocoa from the market. Silver futures prices tumbled for the fifth straight day on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting slack investor demand and ample supplies. The contract for December delivery fell to $ 5.98 a troy ounce during the session but bounced back to settle 5.5 cents below Friday's close at $ 6.025, the lowest <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> silver price since March 26, 1987. Other silver contracts lost as much as 6.9 cents on the day. `` I would say the next stop -LRB- or point of firm support -RRB- is somewhere between $ 5.50 and $ 5.60,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, commodities trading adviser for <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage firm. Gold settled $ 1.60 to $ 1.90 lower with December at $ 416.50 a troy ounce. Soybean futures prices rebounded in afternoon trading to end sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn finished mostly higher while wheat prices fell. The turnaround in soybean prices followed steep daily declines in that market during six of the past seven trading sessions. Monday's rally was due largely to profit-taking by speculators who had sold contracts in earlier sessions in hopes of buying them back at lower prices, analysts said Wheat settled -RCB- cent to 2 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 4.08 \ a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.61 a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 5 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.06 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 15 \ cents higher with January at $ 7.46 Livestock and meat futures finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in uneventful trading ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly cold-storage report. The report, issued after the close, showed record-high frozen pork supplies as of Nov. 1 of 321 million pounds. The previous Nov. 1 record was 312.2 million pounds in 1971, analysts said. The total included 49.6 million pounds of frozen pork bellies, the second-largest monthly pork-belly stocks figure for any month on record. The continued aggressive storage of pork bellies, which are sliced to make bacon, means prices eventually will collapse, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December at 72.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .52 cent to .80 cent lower with January at 81.45 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .48 cent lower with December at 39.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .55 cent to .67 cent lower with February at 42.40 cents a pound On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 7 cents higher with January at $ 12.98 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent to .73 cent higher with December at 43.47 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was unchanged to 1.33 cents lower with December at 44.32 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against West Point in Farley Takeover</HEAD>

 A federal court on Monday rejected two efforts by <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to stave off a buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Textile maker <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> had asked the 11th <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to stay a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing the takeover bid and to grant an injunction postponing the bid while the lower court ruling was appealed. A three-judge panel denied both motions but granted a <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> motion for an expedited appeal. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> had argued that an injunction would be only temporary and could not harm <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> but that denial of one could cause serious harm to <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> announced in May that it would try to buy <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> owns about 9.8 percent of the company's stock. It has offered around $ 1.57 billion, or $ 48 a share, for outstanding shares and <ORGANIZATION> associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> stock in an offer originally scheduled to expire at midnight Monday. `` We are pleased by the court's decision to deny -LRB- <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s -RRB- application for a stay and also by its decision to expedite the hearing,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, chief executive officer. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> also said he's extending the offer to Wednesday, Nov. 30, to expire at midnight <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> time. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has secured financing but says three conditions must be met before it will complete the tender offer. One is that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> remove the hurdle caused by its `` poison pill'' shareholders' rights plan, which allows shareholders not involved in a takeover attempt to buy additional <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> shares in case of a buyout attempt. This makes a buyout more expensive. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> invalidated two key aspects of the `` pill'' last week. The rest remains in place, where <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> officials say they intend to keep it. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> also wants <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover statute ruled unconstitutional and insists that at least two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders tender their shares <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> has taken the anti-takeover statute under advisement but has not said when he might rule. `` Financing is the only thing <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> has in the bag,'' said <PERSON> Josie </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Even if shareholders tender 70 percent of their stock, <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> still has to meet the other two conditions.'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> manufactures Fruit of the Loom underwear. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> products include Gold Toe socks.

<HEAD>LTV Posts $1.24 Billion Loss in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported on Monday a third-quarter net loss of $ 1.24 billion, which company officials attributed largely to Chapter 11-related special charges. A change in accounting principles for post-employment medical and life insurance benefits also had a negative impact on results, officials of the diversified company said. The loss compares with a net profit of $ 109.7 million, or 91 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> officials said the special charges and the accounting change are important elements in moving the company toward its Chapter 11 reorganization. `` Because <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> is in Chapter 11, we believe it is appropriate for the company to record all its liabilities, including the liability for these post-employment benefits, so that they may be appropriately dealt with in the reorganization process,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Tese </PERSON>, a bankruptcy specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Cole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Deitz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Monday's announcement of a negative net worth was not a good signal for the company. `` They'll have to prove to the -LRB- bankruptcy -RRB- court that the plan is feasible,'' <PERSON> Tese </PERSON> said. `` They are going to have to be able to demonstrate to the court that they are healthy enough and that they wo n't have to reorganize again sometime soon.'' The third-quarter special charges total $ 1.34 billion, ost of which is non-cash. They include: _ $ 950 million for Chapter 11 creditors' claims; _ $ 350 million for a reduction of assets and other anticipated costs in the divesture of <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s bar business, as well as additional costs incurred in the rationalization of other steel facilities; _ $ 41 million for the write-off of goodwill recorded in connection with the company's 1983 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Without the two elements, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> said its net income would have been $ 132.2 million for the third quarter and $ 453.7 million for the first nine months of the year. That would have compared with $ 109.7 million and $ 362.0 million for the respective periods in 1987. The change in accounting principle alters the method of accounting for post-employment medical and life insurance benefits and resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge of $ 2.26 billion, recorded as of last Jan. 1. `` The accounting method adopted by <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> recognizes the post-employment medical and life insurance benefits earned by all of the company's retirees and active employees,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said. `` Previously these costs were recognized only as they were paid.'' The change in accounting principle reduced operating income by $ 32.1 million for the third quarter and $ 98.2 million for the nine-month period. For the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 3.25 billion, which company officials also attributed to the special charges and accounting change. That compared with a net profit of $ 362.0 million, or $ 3.07 a share, in the same nine-month period of 1987.

<HEAD>Disney Profit Flat in 4th Qtr., Up 17 Percent for Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its fourth-quarter profit was flat, but that its full-year earnings rose 17 percent, boosted by big-spending theme park patrons and a string of hit movies. <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday its profit was $ 136.4 million, or 99 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, up marginally from $ 135.3 million, or 98 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1987. Sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $ 1.01 billion, up 34 percent from $ 758.6 million a year ago. The results of a subsidiary that has since been sold are included in the figure for fourth-quarter 1987, reducing the quarter-to-quarter gain. When only continuing operations are compared, profits were 23 percent higher in the fourth quarter of 1988 than they were a year ago. For its entire fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 522 million, or $ 3.80 a share, up 17 percent from $ 444.7 million, or $ 3.23 a share, in 1987. Sales in fiscal 1988 were $ 3.44 billion, up 20 percent from $ 2.88 billion the previous year. In Disney's biggest division, theme parks and resorts, year-end sales were up 11 percent, to $ 2.04 billion. The company, which does n't release attendance figures, said attendance was down from last year, but that customers spent more. The movie and television division, riding high on the popularity of `` Three Men and a Baby,'' `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' and `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' recorded a 31 percent gain in sales, to $ 1.15 billion for the year. An expanding string of stores selling Disney-themed toys and clothes had sales of $ 84.6 million, up 78 percent from last year, when far fewer stores were in operation. Results from <ORGANIZATION> Arvida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, a housing developer in <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> has since sold, are included in both the fourth quarter and year-end results for last year.

 New housing starts fell 13.6 percent in the third quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, a report by a private research firm that follows the construction industry said Monday. Starts fell to 371,042 units in the July through September period from 429,376 starts in the same period in 1987, according to the report from the F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The decline was concentrated in multifamily housing construction, <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> vice president and economist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said. `` Since the 1985 peak of the apartment building boom, new construction has been scaled back by nearly half, but vacancy rates have only recently begun to recede from their 20-year high,'' he said. He said stability of mortgage rates in the 10 percent to 10 -LCB- percent range has supported a fairly steady volume of single-fanily homebuilding this year. Leading the list of most active housing areas was <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, at 12,846 new units, followed by the <LOCATION> Riverside-San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernbardino </LOCATION> area at 11,103.

 British <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said on Monday that it had accepted bids totalling $ 267 million for 15 percent of its Magnus oil field in the British sector of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The company said it was selling a 5 percent stake to <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, 5 percent to <ORGANIZATION> Repsol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and 2.5 percent each to <ORGANIZATION> Goal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Braspetro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Details of individual tenders were not disclosed, but the sale valued each 1 percent of <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> at an average of $ 17.8 million. BP Exploration Managing Director <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said the company was pleased with the transaction `` against a background of uncertain oil prices.'' To BP, the proceeds of the sale represented a return equivalent to a crude oil price of $ 22 per 42-gallon barrel in 1989, rising in real terms to $ 25 in 1995, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said. The company believes it `` sensible to realize this extra value now to invest in other oppportunities for the benefit of our shareholders,'' he added. Completion of the sale is subject to the necessary regulatory approvals, including that of the British energy secretary in the transfer of license interests to the purchasers.

<HEAD>FTC Charges Merger Could Lessen Competition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charged Monday that the 1987 merger of <ORGANIZATION> Celanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into American <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> could lessen competition in the manufacture and sale of a widely used plastic. The commission's administrative complaint said the creation of the new <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` could substantially lessen international competition in the manufacture and sale of acetal,'' a plastic used in items such as car parts and disposable lighters. In 1987, before the two companies merged, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> had contended the merger could reduce competition in the production of polyester textile fiber in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A consent agreement was worked out which allowed the merger to go ahead. <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ticknor </PERSON> said the new complaint would be considered by an administrative law judge, and hearing dates were expected to be set on Jan. 3. <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celanese </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Somerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, issued a statement saying it was confident it will prevail in the matter. `` We are astounded that the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has decided to pursue it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of the Engineering Plastics Division. `` The matter will have no impact on our day-to-day activities.'' Before the merger, <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, the company's West German parent, and <ORGANIZATION> Celanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> manufactured acetal in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> through a joint venture, <ORGANIZATION> Ticona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polymerwerke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION>.

 Humorist Art <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> filed a $ 5 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, accusing the studio of stealing his idea for the movie `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' one of last summer's biggest hits. `` It's not only the biggest hit of the year, it will probably be the biggest hit of the decade,'' said <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' greeted with mixed reviews, collected hugh box office receipts last summer, trailing <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s hit `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>,'' which has collected more than $ 147 million. The trade newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Variety </ORGANIZATION> said `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' has grossed more than $ 120 million. <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> is entitled to his promised share of an anticipated $ 250 million in profits for a story `` strikingly similar'' to the movie script. `` He sold the idea to Paramount'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. `` He told them, ` You can change it, fold, spindle or mutilate it, but you have to pay me.''' The lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, is the second action disputing the origin of the hit movie, which starred comedian <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> wrote the story 100 percent,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s manager, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachs </PERSON> `` There are many suits on ` Coming To <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.' Mr. <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> is one of the last to file,'' he said. `` We do n't comment on matters of this kind,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, senior vice president of corporate communications for Paramount. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who is not named in <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s suit, has said he came up with the original idea for `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the tale of an African prince who comes to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, works in a fast food restaurant and takes a wife. <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s script, called `` King For A Day,'' tells of a king from an oil-rich country who comes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, loses his power in a coup while he's absent, winds up living in a ghetto where he works for a caterer and pursues a woman who works for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' story is similar, but the action occurs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s love interest is the daughter of the man who owns the fast food chain where he works. <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> said his story, presented in an eight-page treatment, was optioned by Paramount in 1983. But Paramount officially dropped the project in January 1985, and <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> subsequently sold the idea to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, which dropped it when word surfaced that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> had a similar movie in production, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. The attorney said <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> had `` an iron clad contract'' with <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, which called for him to receive a flat fee plus percentages of net profits when `` King For A Day'' was produced. The columnist said he has written about 10 <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> screen treatments in the past and `` I've always gotten paid.'' He said none of those ideas ever became a movie. With more income expected from home video sales and foreign markets, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said the movie is expected to gross $ 250 million. `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s manager said the actor came up with the idea,'' said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. `` The problem is that <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and his manager both read Mr. <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>'s story.'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said he can prove that they read it based on his two-month investigation of the case. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract rather than copyright infringement.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors on Monday approved a $ 3.6 billion leveraged buyout plan led by senior management, just over a month after rejecting the offer. The board of the nation's largest health care concern announced late Monday it had agreed to the $ 51 a share cash and securities offer by <ORGANIZATION> TF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a company formed by <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> management and headed by <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The group's offer includes $ 43 in cash and $ 8 in securities for each of <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>'s 71.4 million common shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> stock closed up 62 -LCB- cents at $ 46.62 -LCB- a share Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The offer still must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> stockholders in a February meeting, company officials stated in a news release. No date was given for the meeting. <PERSON> Frist </PERSON> could be immediately reached for comment. A special committee of outside directors had rejected the Frist group's initial offer of $ 47 a share, and rejected the $ 51 a share proposal on Oct. 17. The committee at that time indicated it would accept bids from other parties through Nov. 18, although a number of industry analysts expressed skepticism the company would get a higher offer. `` The board's approval was based in part upon the recommendation of a special committee of board comprised of nine outside directors and the opinion of <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> that, as of Nov. 21, 1988, the consideration to be paid in the merger is fair to <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders from a financial point of view,'' according to board's Monday release. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Mol </PERSON> said he did not know whether any other offers were made by the Nov. 18 deadline. <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION>, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals worldwide, set up the special committee to consider buyout offers after the initial proposal in mid-September. The company sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over a year ago to a new employee-owned company, <ORGANIZATION> HealthTrust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in a spinoff that netted <ORGANIZATION> HCA </ORGANIZATION> almost $ 1.6 billion.

 A federal judge will hear motions next month stemming from three jurors' claims that they were intimidated into voting for an $ 8.15 million judgment against the maker of the Copper 7 intrauterine device, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary manufactured the Copper 7, on Monday released a letter that the jurors sent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>, who presided over the trial. The jury on Sept. 9 awarded the damages to <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, who claimed the birth control device had left her infertile. The three jurors, whose names were withheld at their request, also indicated they did not believe the plaintiff proved her claim that the device caused her injuries. The judgment represented the first jury award of punitive damages against <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> in a Copper 7 case. The pharmaceutical company has won 15 of 19 Copper 7 damage cases that have gone before a jury. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schannon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> attorneys would introduce motions to vacate the award. <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> will hear the motions Dec. 1 in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schannon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> can let the verdict stand, reduce the award or order a new trial, <PERSON> Schannon </PERSON> said. The letter from the three jurors claimed that `` continual verbal harassment and intimidation'' by the jury foreman during deliberations prevented them from expressing their opinion about the trial evidence. `` Our failure to understand the purpose and-or power of the jury foreman facilitated our inability to express individual opinions,'' the letter read. The three jurors also stated that a desire to inform the court of a 4-4 split among jury was prevented by `` a convenient interpretation of the jury and judge's instructions.'' `` Any opinions which conflicted with the foreman's -LRB- plaintiff's -RRB- views were met with disdain and contempt and resulted in additional verbal and-or physical harassment,'' the letter said. `` When the obvious difference of opinion became apparent, discussions and negotiations ceased. `` While believing that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> may have been negligent in advertising, we individually assessed that <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> never proved that the CU-7 caused her injuries ...'' the letter read. `` Summarily, we individually and collectively feel ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with a verdict against our true opinions,'' the three wrote. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duesenberg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, said the jurors wrote the letter on their own initiative and neither <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> nor <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> saw the letter until it was received by <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>. `` This is an important letter for our shareholders for two reasons: first, the plaintiff's attorneys failed to convince the full jury that the Cu-7 cause the plaintiff's injuries, and second, this case should not be viewed as a watershed,'' <PERSON> Duesenberg </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>'s attorney issued a statement labeling the letter legally irrelevant, and accusing <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> lawyers of having met with the three jurors. `` This is simploy a desperate and futile attempt by <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> to achieve a result they could n't achieve in court,'' stated lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>. `` This is nothing more than post-verdict jury tampering.''
