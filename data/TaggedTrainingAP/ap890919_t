 Organizations formed after the 1985 earthquake that killed more than 10,000 people marked the anniversary of the disaster with anti-government demonstrations and memorial services Tuesday. About 250 people from the Sept. 19 Seamstresses Union attended a Mass and then briefly blocked busy <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Abad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where hundreds perished in garment factories that collapsed during the quake. About 50 riot police forced the demonstrators back to the sidewalk, allowing morning rush-hour traffic to resume. Several groups placed flowers at Solidarity Plaza where a hotel burned in the quake. Residents of the <LOCATION> Tlatelolco </LOCATION> housing complex attended a Mass at 7:19 a.m. _ the time the quake collapsed two of the three sections of a 14-story apartment building. Organizations demanding housing for the homeless made a 20-block march to the <LOCATION> Zocalo </LOCATION>, the capital's main plaza, where an estimated 12,000 people gathered for a rally. `` There are more than 2,000 homeless families still living in temporary camps in the Cuahtemoc borough,'' <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Varas </PERSON>, one of the protest organizaers, said in an interview. He said there are about 1,500 housing units promised by the government that have n't been turned over to the quake victims. `` There is open corruption in the delivery. We demand cleanliness in the distribution of housing,'' Varas said. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> raised the flag to half-staff in the Zocalo earlier Tuesday, observed a minute of silence and dedicated a new government hospital that replaced a 12-story building that fell. He said the new <ORGANIZATION> Juarez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> `` comes out of the tragedy of the September 1985 earthquakes. It is, in essence, a memorial to those who died, and at the same time, shows us that Mexicans can convert adversity into regeneration and above all, permanently maintain the solidarity in benefit of all our countrymen.'' The destroyed hospital was one of two where 19 babies survived in the rubble for from eight hours to nearly nine days before they were rescued. Dehydrated and covered with infected wounds when they were found, the `` miracle babies'' today are active 4-year-olds. The government said 6,000 people perished in the earthquake and an aftershock the next day. Others have placed the death toll as high as 32,000. More than 400 buildings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, with a population of 18 million, were destroyed and 5,700 damaged, according to the government. The Sept. 19 Seamstresses' Union and the organizations for the homeless were among groups that were organized after the quake. Many have developed into permanent activist groups. In July 1988, leftist political parties with the support of many of the groups made their strongest showing in a Mexican presidential election, holding <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> to just over 50 percent of the vote.

 Islanders boarded up their homes and bought supplies Tuesday as Hurricane Hugo, blamed in at least 25 deaths, swept along the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> after leaving an estimated 50,000 people homeless in the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Weather officials said the hurricane would begin affecting the British colony of Turks and <LOCATION> Caicos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> southeast of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> chain on Tuesday night. The storm was moving on a parallel course east of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` All of the islands at some time or another are going to get some effects -LRB- from Hugo -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Risnychok </PERSON>, specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. Weather officials in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> feared <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> could drift westward toward more populated islands, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. That island, which includes the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> capital city of <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, is the most populated with an estimated 135,000 people. The government of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> Tuesday downgraded the hurricane watch for the central <ORGANIZATION> Bahamas </ORGANIZATION> to a tropical storm warning. A tropical storm warning remained in effect for the southern <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, though it was discontinued for the Turks and <LOCATION> Caicos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. At 10:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, the hurricane's center was near latitude 23.8 degrees north and longitude 69.5 west, about 190 miles east northeast of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> was moving in a northwesterly direction at about 12 miles per hour with its highest sustained winds at 105 mph. Government officials in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> were monitoring the hurricane but had not made any special preparations Tuesday for Hugo, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON>, press secretary for the government's information office. Residents were told to monitor weather advisories but could go about their daily businesses, he said. `` They were telling everybody to get the water, the lamps handy,'' said <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Naussau </PERSON>, who has a stall at The Straw Market on <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. `` We never had a storm here for some years. We're always hearing about storms, but they never come. `` Some people worry, some people do n't,'' she said. `` Although the indications are that it's going to move east of the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it can change direction,'' <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON> said residents were gathering supplies in preparation. `` The stores have reported brisk sales of supplies such as flashlight batteries and lumber for boarding up windows,'' he said. Weather officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Bahamas </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s threat to the northwestern <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> has intensified because of the west-northwestern drift that the hurricane is expected to take. `` This westward drift can spell trouble for the northwestern <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> which includes the bulk of the population,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightbourne </PERSON>, chief meteorological officer for the government's weather agency in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> Officials with <ORGANIZATION> Paradise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said they had not changed flight schedules yet, but were monitoring the hurricane's path. `` We're just keeping a close eye on it like everybody else,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Riesdorph </PERSON>, director of flight operations for the airlines. He said the company makes 11 round-trip flights daily from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, which is linked by a bridge to <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stopped in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Monday and reassured officials that cleanup work is not over on the oil-smeared beaches of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` The job is not complete,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said during a brief refueling stop en route to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` You have our assurance that we will stay until the job is complete.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s role as federal coordinator in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> has been monitoring <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup work since three weeks after the March 24 wreck of the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>. The tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> after slamming into a reef, resulting in the nation's worst oil spill Exxon declared its summer cleanup finished on Friday. The company said dwindling sunlight and deteriorating weather made further work this year unsafe. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit came as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> in a swing through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended his decision not to travel to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, saying he had sent his `` environmental vice president.'' During his visit, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent about a half-hour with <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s `` oiled mayors'' _ the mayors of five coastal communities where crude continues to wash up on shore and where fishing fleets generally were tied up for the summer Last May, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> inspected the oil spill cleanup on <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Monday it would not surprise him to learn that parts of the island, among the first and hardest hit by the spill, remain oily months after cleanup began. The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> mayors apparently won no new promises of action from the administration. But <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seemed to listen to the mayors' concerns about the federal cleanup role next spring. `` We told him the spill's not over just because <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has completed work and gone,'' <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON> said. The vice president also met briefly with driftnet fishermen, who are concerned about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's new agreement aimed at restricting driftnet fleets from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from fishing the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> for squid. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen oppose the use of driftnets by foreign fleets because they contend the lightweight nets illegally harvest thousands of tons of salmon and steelhead.

 Court proceedings were instituted against the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> by a group seeking information about hundreds of people the guerrilla movement allegedly detained. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, who returned last week after 30 years in exile, was served with court papers Monday by a deputy sheriff following the legal move by the <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.

But the <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in documents filed with the territorial <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, claimed 1,400 people either remain in <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> prison camps or have disappeared. The committee called on <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> to account for the whereabouts of the missing people. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegation is due back in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> soon after a trip to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> to determine whether any prisoners are at <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> camps. According to freed detainees, hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> members were accused of being South African spies and many were tortured until they signed confessions. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> leaders have confirmed incidents of torture, and have countered that the South African-led security forces also were guilty of brutality.

<HEAD>Pay in Foreign Products Inspires Soviets to Work 10 Times Harder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Berry-pickers in the Soviet Far North gathered ten times as many blueberries and cranberries this year after a Swedish-Soviet firm offered to pay them with foreign fashions and consumer electronics, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> says. The Soviet news agency reported <PERSON> Mondya </PERSON> that cooperatives in the <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> area gathered 100 tons of blueberries and 500 tons of cowberries, a type of tundra cranberry, for a Swedish-Soviet joint venture called Artikfryuz. That is ten times the amount they collected in their most productive years. Soviet stores are nearly empty, particularly in provincial towns like <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION>. The few goods often are allocated by privilege, so Soviet workers paid in rubles can find themselves with nothing to buy. Soviet citizens are not allowed to hold foreign currency, and the handful who work for foreign firms receive a fraction of their pay in credit at hard currency stores. The Tass story was the first to indicate that foreign firms might be able to pay Soviets directly with imported consumer goods. The Soviet government also has started an experiment that will pay grain farmers in hard currency for producing extra wheat in hopes of cutting the amount they now import at higher, world-market prices.

<HEAD>Heiress Leaves Estate To Help Town Children Go to College</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An heiress who considered residents of this resort town her family worried that the tourist wealth was n't reaching them So when she died, she left an estate of $ 800,000 to help each child go to college. When <PERSON> Celia </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Provincetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1921, she was herself a recipient of a scholarship. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> reportedly was criticized for taking the money because her family was wealthly and some say she left her fortune to ease the sting of those remarks. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> used the money to attend <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and went on to become a government lawyer. She returned home in the 1950s to be with her mother and brother, who were all that remained of her immediate family. But soon after her arrival, both died suddenly within two months of each other. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, who was unmarried, was left with a substantial inheritance from her father's and brother's real estate business _ much of it was made supplying housing to the artists and writers who made up the first wave of tourists here. Alone, she took on the <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION> community as her new family, said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a close friend. `` She always kept her eye on what was happening in the town,'' said <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> on Friday. `` She kept in contact with her friends through an address book. She put down their names, and their children's names, where they went to school _ and it was whole family trees.'' <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION>, at the farthest end of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> from the mainland and about a three hour's drive from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, is like many seaside resorts: its population, normally around 4,000, swells to more than 10 times that in the summer. Tourist dollars provide a livelihood for many residents, but it's largely seasonal work. `` Most -LRB- young residents -RRB- work in the summertime and collect unemployment benefits in the winter,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, the high school's guidance counselor. `` There's not a lot of high-paying jobs.'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> often talked about how important education was for expanding a person's options, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. In the end, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> stayed true to her adopted family. She died from cancer in 1983, but her bequest established a fund of almost $ 800,000, enough to offer financial aid of $ 500 to $ 5,000 for every college-bound student. Between 30 and 40 students graduate from <LOCATION> Provincetown </LOCATION> High each year, and more than three-quarters go on to two - and four-year colleges Students say the money encourages them to think about wider options. `` Whereas before maybe some kids ruled out college altogether, maybe now they'll consider it,'' said one recent scholarship recipient on Monday, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who used his $ 5,000 award to help pay tuition at <ORGANIZATION> Worcester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` I just think more are thinking about going to college,'' said <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, who retired in 1985 as the high school's principal. `` And even if they go and only last a year, it's expanding their horizons.'' They are also thinking more about <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, although she remains something of an enigma even to those who knew her. Dr. <PERSON> Wilsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>' neighbor for the last six years of her life, suggests <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> was trying to repay the community for the scholarship she accepted more than 60 years ago. `` I think that's why she bequeathed this huge amount, in order to pay back that scholarship grant,'' said Ryder, who sits on the committee charged with dispensing the fund. The scholarship program itself is not without controversy. The scholarship committee has come under fire from residents for the way it awards the money, and the amounts it doles out. In the four years that the scholarships have been awarded, less than half of the available interest of about $ 80,000 a year has been handed out. This year' applicants got a total of $ 30,000, and in an irony that might have pained <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, the committee rejected one student on the basis that aid was not needed. The will stipulated those with need and academic ability get a scholahship, but almost every applicant gets some money. Ryder said that management expenses and the need to add to the principal to keep pace with inflation have cut into the available funding. `` It always sounds like a terrible bundle, but the cost rises each year,'' she said.

 A teen-ager was arraigned under heavy security Monday in connection with the Labor Day weekend stabbings and beatings of a woman and her two daughters and the death of a woman in 1987. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 15, entered no plea to four counts of delinquency by first-degree murder and two counts of burglary. Family Court Judge <PERSON> Carmine </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPetrillo </PERSON> ordered Price held at the state <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a juvenile prison `` for his protection and the protection of the public.'' The judge closed the second floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> to all but reporters, lawyers and police because of `` certain death threats that were made against the defendant.'' DiPetrillo and Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> did not elaborate. Price, a former high school football player known as `` Iron Man'' who was repeating the ninth grade, said nothing during the hearing. His mother, father and older brother attended the hearing but had no comment. `` He gave a statement to the investigating detectives ... which would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both homicides,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said at a news conference after the arraignment. About 30 people gathered outside the courthouse, including some of Price's friends who claimed he could not have killed anyone. Price was arrested Sunday at his house, about a block from where <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON>, 39, and her daughters, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 8, were found beaten and stabbed to death in their home Sept. 4. Stabbing victim <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 27, who died in July 1987, lived two houses away from Price. `` He gave a statement to the investigating detectives ... which would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both homicides,'' police Chief <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said at a news conference after the arraignment. Some residents of the neighborhood said they had been wary of letting their children play outside because of the killings, and gun dealers and alarm companies reported increased business. <PERSON> DiPetrillo </PERSON> said Price was charged with three counts of deliquency first-degree murder and one count of deliquency burglary in the <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> killings. He also was charged with one count each of deliquency first-degree murder and burglary in <LOCATION> Spencer </LOCATION>'s killing. <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said that under the state's juvenile laws, Price, if found delinquent, could be held at the <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> only until age 21. The attorney general has been unsuccessfully trying to get the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to pass legislation allowing juveniles under age 16 who face capital charges to be tried as adults. DiPetrillo set a probable cause hearing for Thursday at which the state must outline its case against Price. Investigators have declined to provide details so far. An autopsy revealed that Ms. <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> and her daughters had bruises and numerous broken bones, apparently from a struggle with their killer, leading police to speculate the killer might have been cut or injured. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON>, 18, who said he lived with the Prices until a few days ago, said Price showed him a cut left index finger when <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> returned home early on Sept. 2. ` You could see the bone on one side. It was deep,'' <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said. Price said he had punched out a car window, he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 18, said Price also showed him the cut, but hours before police said they believed the Heatons were killed. Although <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> described Price as a `` tough and vicious'' lineman on the football team, `` I just do n't think he's capable of it. He's not cold-hearted like that.''

 An 11-year-old girl has been charged with setting a fire that killed four children at a foster home and injured 12 other people. <PERSON> Lakeya </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON>, whose half-brother was among the dead in the Aug. 31 blaze, was arrested Sunday and ordered held without bail pending a preliminary hearing Sept. 27. <PERSON> Lakeya </PERSON>, who also lived in the home, was not injured in the fire. She appeared in the arraignment room about 2:30 a.m. Monday without an attorney or any family members present. When Bail Commissioner <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cubbage </PERSON> asked her if she understood the charges, she nodded her head. She was charged with four counts of murder, 11 counts of aggravated assault, 11 counts of simple assault, 11 counts of recklessly endangering another person, one count of arson and one count of risking and causing a catastrophe, police Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. According to an unidentified police source quoted in Monday's editions of The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer, investigators believe <PERSON> Lakeya </PERSON>, just hours before the blaze, told another occupant not to sleep at the house because a fire was going to occur <PERSON> Lakeya </PERSON> also had mentioned a blaze would occur in the house before one of two previous fires, the source said. Police would not speculate on a motive. The fire started about 3 a.m. on Aug. 31 in the six-bedroom stone and frame house where <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Artis </PERSON> had kept foster children since 1972. Gasoline had been poured on an enclosed porch, the living room and stairwell, investigators said. Killed were <PERSON> Lakeya </PERSON>'s half-brother, <PERSON> Anwan </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 8, and three other children. All were trapped in a second-floor bedroom. Eleven residents of the house and a firefighter were injured. The Artises, both 65, were injured. Authorities described them as `` outstanding foster parents'' but added that too many children were residing in the house. <PERSON> Lakeya </PERSON> had been placed in the home in 1986 by the city <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, police said. She and her half-brother had been taken from their mother, <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>, 29, because of neglect, said the children's grandfather, <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwell </PERSON>. Shortly after the fire, he said his daughter had a drug problem and `` would n't take care of the kids.''

 As the 44th General Assembly opens, diplomats and officials are looking forward to a new era of international cooperation after last year's session saw `` an end to the Cold War.'' In the last two years, the 159 nations have built upon the thaw between the superpowers, addressing in earnest issues such as peacekeeping, pollution and the world economy in a new, cooperative spirit. `` There's a feeling that fundamental changes are happening ... and that now is not the time ... to play up national differences,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiers </PERSON>, the undersecretary for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` People want to work together and seek solutions to problems rather than score debating points.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> approved that approach in speeches to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> last year. Those speeches, said <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the departing assembly president, `` are the deepest and most eloquent reflection of profound change that has occurred.'' `` They demonstrate, I would venture to say, the end of the Cold War, which hovered over our world for such a long period,'' he said. On Monday, <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> closed the yearlong 43rd session of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Several unresolved issues were postponed for consideration by the 44th session, which was to begin today. The most dramatic was the Palestinian question and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s crackdown on the 21-month-old uprising in the occupied territories that has left at least 572 Palestinians and 40 Israelis dead. That issue also provoked the biggest controversy of last year's assembly, when the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to address the assembly <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> denied him a visa on the grounds that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> supported terrorism against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The General Assembly took the unprecedented protest step of moving to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for five days in December to hear the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief. At the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, eliminating the two key issues on which the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had refused his visa request. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has said he wants to address this year's <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it has not yet received a visa request and will not comment on whether it would be granted. <PERSON> Spiers </PERSON>, the top-ranking American in the world body and a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary, told reporters that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> should be allowed to speak if he wishes. Arab League Ambassador <PERSON> Clovis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON> said he was confident the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would grant a visa if one was requested. If the visa is not granted, said <PERSON> Maksoud </PERSON>, `` of course we would want to go back to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> has more than enough allies in the assembly to change its venue. Among speakers scheduled to present their governments' views are President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is to address the assembly Monday, and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, set to speak the following day. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on Sept. 29 will have a chance to speak about his nation's battle against the cocaine cartels. Other heads of state scheduled to speak include the presidents of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>. The assembly was to choose a new president today. Under a system of rotating regional representation, the African nations nominated the assembly leader this year. They selected <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Garba </PERSON>, a crusader against apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s legal system of racial segregation. The main portion of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s work ends in mid-December, but it will then hold a five-day special session on apartheid.

 <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who keeps his <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 150 in a pasture, says he will add one more item to his preflight inspection. `` I'm definitely adding ` snake' to my checklist,'' said the <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> pilot, who came face-to-face with a 1 -LCB- - foot-long bull snake while cruising comfortably at 800 feet Friday night <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Rovere </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hawk </LOCATION> were about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Sturgis </LOCATION>, a western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> community, when the snake popped its head up through a hole in the dashboard, about 2 feet in front of their faces. `` He was hissing and sticking his tongue out at us,'' <PERSON> Rovere </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reached for a rag, grabbed the snake and threw it out the window. `` Stuff just flew everywhere. It was a mess,'' <PERSON> Rovere </PERSON> said. `` After it was over, we got quite a chuckle out of it,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. He figures the snake crawled up the tail assembly, through the fuselage and into the engine compartment. The bull snake is nonpoisonous and feeds mostly on rodents.

 For <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Koravos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzzetta </PERSON>, Interstate 5 is their freeway of love. The two said `` I do'' Sunday while parked in a stretch limousine on the freeway. It was an appropriate spot: The couple first met on the interstate three years ago. `` I was driving along, heading south on I-5, and I could just feel this car tailing me,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Koravos </PERSON>. `` So I pulled into the other lane and looked over to give this person a dirty look.'' Instead, she found herself grinning at a winking <PERSON> Guzzetta </PERSON>. He motioned to her to pull off. She did, and they went out for a drink. They discovered that a mutual business acquaintance had suggested two days before that the two get together to discuss the direct mail business, which Ms. <PERSON> Koravos </PERSON> was in at the time and <PERSON> Guzzetta </PERSON> was considering entering. `` I tell my friends to forget the single bars,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Koravos </PERSON>. `` If you're looking for the right person, just drive on the freeways ... and smile.'' <PERSON> Guzzetta </PERSON>, who eventually bought a direct-mail firm, also took an unusual approach in his marriage proposal. He sent her a package of direct-mail ads, including one that asked, `` Dear <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, will you please marry me? <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Koravos </PERSON> answered by calling a <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> restaurant that night and asking the maitre d' to write on the portable menu board, along with the specials, `` Yes, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, I will.''

 A man who spent 20 years on the rodeo circuit now makes his living making boots and other items that fit the special needs of professional cowboys. And a few yuppies who would like to look like professional cowboys. <PERSON> Veldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, his wife and two sons, run the <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> that greets visitors to this community of about two-dozen people in the heart of the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. Handmade Morgan boots, which line the walls of the rustic store built in 1869, run from $ 119 to $ 750, excluding custom orders. The newest boot, a lace-up roper, was the brainchild of the 54-year-old <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> and a professional rodeo friend and customer. `` Regular cowboy boots have a somewhat flimsy shaft,'' explained <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Veldon </PERSON>'s son and general manager. `` Professional ropers complain that when they step, jump or fly off a horse it's easy to twist an ankle in conventional boots. A U-shaped toe and a block heel make the new lace-up boots working boots bound to be a hit with cowboys. `` The professional rodeo cowboy is a honed athlete, but they've always had to dress like a ranch cowboy,'' the elder <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said Monday `` To send them into the rodeo arena dressed like a ranch cowboy is like sending a boxer into the ring wearing cowboy boots,'' said <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who was on the professional rodeo circuit for 20 years. `` The guy with the boxing shoes would beat the other guy every time.'' The company also has found a new market: `` one we'd never expect, among yuppies on the coasts,'' his son said. `` The idea of a lace-up cowboy boot must just appeal to them.'' So, apparently, does the gear used to carry coiled ropes and boots and saddles, he said. `` We've expanded the nylon luggage line into a whole area of backpacking, horsepacking and camping equipment as well,'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. More than 40 people work in the large manufacturing plant and warehouses attached to the store. The complex has been expanded twice as the business has grown, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. Last spring, the company bought the <ORGANIZATION> Laramie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and some manufacturing is done in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Handmade saddles ranging from $ 895 to $ 2,000 have become another staple of the business. It takes 15 hours to assemble a plain saddle's 25 to 30 parts, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. Craftsmen work at individual booths in the factory, concentrating on one saddle at a time. `` We've tried to make things that are needed,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. `` Somebody made lace-up boots back in the'30s and then quit. We decided to pick it up again. It's a new frontier out there.''

<HEAD>AIDS Drugs Showing Promising Initial Results in Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Long-term studies with AZT show the AIDS drug can reverse many symptoms of the disease in children while avoiding side effects, researchers say. The drug previously has been shown to extend the lives of adults with AIDS and to delay the development of symptoms in those who are infected but not yet sick. A year ago, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> scientists reported it could prevent brain abnormalities in children, but concerns about its side effects remained. The most extensive study of AZT in children now shows it is safe, helps children gain weight and avoid life-threatening infections, and improves their well-being, says <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The study, part of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> project to assess AZT in children, was reported Monday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, AZT's maker, <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, announced it was cutting the wholesale price of the drug by 20 percent, from $ 1.50 to $ 1.20 per capsule. A year's supply has been costing patients $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 In other studies reported here, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> researchers said they had obtained promising initial results with two newer AIDS drugs, called ddI and ddC. The drugs helped restore some brain function to a few children out of several dozen tested, without causing dangerous side effects, said Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>, the institute's chief of pediatrics. A 32-month-old boy who had lost the ability to stand and walk and was losing his speech _ all because of an AIDS infection in the brain _ stood, began walking with help and began to speak more clearly after being given ddI, said Dr. <PERSON> Karina </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> of the cancer institute. About one-third of the children given ddI and ddC showed signs that their AIDS-damaged immune systems were at least partially restored. Furthermore, both the new drugs seem to work well in combination with AZT, said <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>. `` That seems to us to be an area worthy of study,'' he said. `` We're on the lookout for agents that can be put into combination regimens.'' The combination may, as is the case with cancer drugs, reduce side effects while increasing efficacy, <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> explained. One child in the study, for example, could not tolerate regular doses of AZT without serious side effects but is now doing well on an alternating combination of AZT and ddC. Twelve of 35 children required blood transfusions to counteract anemia caused by AZT's toxic effects on their bone marrow, <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said. Some also showed low white blood cell counts. But those side effects were considered manageable. Only five of the patients developed the so-called opportunistic infections that often kill AIDS patients. The children ranged from 5 months to 13 years old. Ten were younger than age 2. `` It's looking more and more that that's who's going to be getting it among kids,'' <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said Giving it to children early may delay the development of serious brain disorders, which occur in about 80 percent of children with AIDS, <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said. Determining when to give AZT to children will be difficult, however, because studies have shown that AIDS can be quite different in children and adults, <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> said. `` It may be that children need to start earlier and get higher doses,'' he said. For example, AIDS does n't usually appear in adults until their T4-cell count, a measure of the immune system's health, drops below 500. Adults with a T4-cell count above 500 are usually healthy. `` That's not a valid number for children,'' said <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>. `` All of us have lost kids who have had T4 counts above 1,000.''

 Backers of a holiday to honor assassinated civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> are hoping the prospect of a Super Bowl can succeed where convention boycotts and bad publicity failed. `` Without a holiday, there is little chance in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> for a Super Bowl,'' House Minority Leader <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a Democrat who leads the pro-holiday forces, said Monday. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Shover </PERSON>, a newspaper executive who heads the booster group <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> 93, agreed. `` We feel sure if we do n't have a King holiday we wo n't be on a level playing field for the'93 Super Bowl,'' said <PERSON> Shover </PERSON>, director of community and corporate services for <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, publishers of The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. The issue comes up as part of a special session that begins Wednesday on prison crowding, drugs and economic development, and both sides are squirming already. `` If we fail again, the frustration level ... will rise,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. But Senate President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, a Republican who wants the issue referred to a general election ballot, said the bill is not appropriate for a special session. `` With a special session, you want to get out quickly,'' Usdane said. `` You do n't need controversy in a special session.'' The Republican-controlled House has voted for a King holiday in the past, but conservative <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> have defeated the proposal. The fight has been going on for years. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, then about to launch a presidential campaign and frustrated by lack of progress on the King issue, signed an executive proclamation in 1986 giving state employees the day off. Republican state Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> declared that <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> lacked authority to issue such an order, however. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>'s successor, Republican <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, rescinded the proclamation before it could take effect <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> also said he did not believe that King deserved a holiday, and civil rights groups launched a boycott of the state as a convention site. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment in April 1988 on unrelated charges brought Secretary of State Rose Mofford to power as governor. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, a Democrat, has pledged to do whatever is necessary for a King holiday. But while Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has lobbied quietly for the bill since then, most <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans have held fast against it. A recent study estimates the state has lost $ 256 million in convention and tourist business since <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s order, and some Super Bowl boosters say <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>'s bid for the 1993 game is doomed if there's no holiday. But some <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans say the holiday is a slap in the face to <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> because it would follow the federal practice of combining holidays for <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> into a single holiday in exchange for a state holiday honoring King. Some <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators have offered to vote for a bill that would trade in Columbus Day for King Day. But Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said she rejects that option, and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers say they would prefer to avoid it, even though they consider it a possibility. Religious leaders and business executives have been urging approval of the King holiday for years, but <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers say their constituents do n't agree. Furthermore, they note, many of the businesses that are pushing for the holiday do n't even give their own employees the day off. `` They ought to take a look in the mirror,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, a Republican who is among those targeted by the executives.

 Tired of all those videocassettes cluttering up your house? Would n't it be nice to be able to tape 10 favorite TV soaps or five or six movies on one cassette? How about 30 hours of recording per cassette? West German videocassette manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION> says that by 1991 it will be offering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> viewers a tape with a 10-hour capacity. Meanwhile, a Finnish company, <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION>, says it has developed a new technology allowing a new line of VHS recorders to cram those 10 hours onto a tape without the loss of picture quality that results when today's VCRs are cranked down to their slowest speeds. `` The picture quality is better than existing long-play systems,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lauri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kivinen </PERSON> said in a telephone interview last week. <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION>, a major manufacturer of television sets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, hopes to license its new technology to VCR manufacturers and the new recorders could be on the market sometime in 1990, <PERSON> Kivinen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION> tape will be usable on existing videocassette recorders. <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION> will use a superstrong, thin polyester film to pile more tape into each videocassette, according to the Sept. 11 issue of TV Digest, which reviewed the new <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION> products at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Audio-Visual Fair. The <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION> cassette will allow up to 15 hours of taping on VCRs with a European system that uses a slower speed than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> videocassette recorders. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> VCRs provide two hours of recording at normal speed on a standard cassette. American VCRs also have a half-speed, long-play mode that allows four hours of recording, and a one-third, extended-play speed that allows six hours of recording. The higher the taping speed, the better the image quality. <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> says it has found a way to record at a speed equivalent to the extended-play mode while maintaining image quality that is better than long-play mode. <PERSON> Kivinen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> hopes its system will become the new standard for VCRs. TV Digest quoted the system's inventor, <ORGANIZATION> Nokia </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Reime </PERSON>, as saying that although no tests have been conducted, 30 hours of taping may be possible using his new technology. <PERSON> Reime </PERSON> said the new circuitry could cost as little as $ 3 to incorporate into new VCRs. <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION> has been testing its new super long-play tape for about a year and will introduce it in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this fall, according to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Neidhart </PERSON>, director of marketing at <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION>'s information systems division in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` By 1991 we expect to offer the 10-hour tape in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Neidhart </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION> already markets a videocassette in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that allows eight hours of taping at slow speed. But the tape has captured only a small percentage of the blank videocassette market, which is approaching 300 million units in annual sales, <PERSON> Neidhart </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> BASF </ORGANIZATION> launched a national television ad campaign last month to try to boost sales for the eight-hour tape. `` We know from research that most people would like to use a longer tape for some or all of their recording purposes,'' <PERSON> Neidhart </PERSON> said, noting that it means viewers wo n't run out of tape too soon and that the tapes will take up less space in their video libraries.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plans to boost <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s trade status following a series of steps viewed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as progress on economic and political issues by the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation. `` <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has undertaken major steps toward economic and political reform,'' leading to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to grant most-favored nation status to the Eastern European communist state, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said on Monday. Speaking at a news conference in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the move `` will open new doors for the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> economy, encouraging greater market orientation and increasing the foreign exchange earnings.'' That and other initiatives were announced Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> for talks with Hungarian officials. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> today quoted <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s new parliament speaker, <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szuros </PERSON>, as saying he sees the possibility that his nation could withdraw from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and become neutral by the end of the century. <PERSON> Szuros </PERSON> said the shift to neutrality could take place `` within a climate of trust'' between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The package announced by <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> also includes new development programs and the establishment of a $ 25 million fund to help create private business in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The proposals are part of a comprehensive pact to `` support <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s efforts to develop a freer political system and to create and expand private enterprise,'' said <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>. The White House released <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in which he said `` it is my intent to add <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to the list'' of countries that qualify for most-favored nation status, which would guarantee <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> the lowest tariffs for its products that any competing country gets. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> recently defied authorities in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by allowing thousands of East German citizens to use <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as a conduit to emigrate to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In May, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> tore down the barbed wire fence that had sharply restricted travel by Hungarians to the West. According to his spokeswoman, the only foreign gift that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> keeps in his office is a piece of the fence which Hungarian officials gave him during his visit to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in July. The administration also attaches significance, officials said, to the withdrawal of some Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in recent months, part of a commitment by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to reduce overall troop levels in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Monday's announcement came four days after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to double food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ another <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> member _ to $ 100 million in the next fiscal year. Many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not doing more for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> following the accession of a non-communist premier in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. There has been less pressure for an increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cooperation with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic situation is far bleaker than <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said the $ 25 million to help develop private business in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` is an important part of implementing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s goal of building an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> partnership with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> will be granted permanent most-favored trade status in October if its parliament, as expected, enacts legislation on freedom of emigration by the end of September. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is notifying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of his intention to designate <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as eligible for Generalized System of Preferences treatment, which would offer Hungarian exporters duty-free tariff treatment for a broad range of exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> worth more than $ 110 million. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, complained Monday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has n't moved quickly enough to support East European communist nations _ such as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> _ that are moving toward democratic change. `` The administration's timidity in the face of these opportunities is puzzling and dismaying,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Instead of encouragement and engagement, the administration has adopted an almost passive stance.''

 The American who sponsored <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s tour of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strongly denies accusations published by a Soviet newspaper that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> maverick was publicly drunk for much of the trip `` If there was any problem with <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, it was jet lag,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Esalen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the nine-day, 11-city tour. `` Most of the time he was cold sober.'' Pravda, organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on Monday reprinted an article from the Italian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republica </ORGANIZATION> saying <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was repeatedly drunk during the tour and squandered his lecture fees shopping. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> `` leaves behind him a wake of catastrophic prophecies, insane expenses, interviews, and above all the perfume of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> Black label,'' said the article, translated into Russian. Pravda did not comment on the article, but advertised it in a front-page box that said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> found the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` a holiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers long.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, interviewed as he arrived back in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from the trip, called the report `` garbage.'' `` It's a simple lie, slander and revenge for the fact that Americans received us with admiration,'' he said, flushing with anger. The Pravda article clearly reflected Kremlin anger at <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s criticism of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other top leaders While in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had made mistakes and faced a potential revolution from Soviet citizens dissatisfied with the pace of reform. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was dumped from his job as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief and his post on the ruling Politburo for making similar comments in late 1987. But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> voters overwhelmingly elected him to the newly constituted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION>' Deputies last March. Before leaving <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> `` predicted the knives would be out on his return,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, who accompanied him throughout the tour. `` What Pravda has done is for political motivations,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>. Asked to comment on reports that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> drank a bottle and a half of whiskey the night before he spoke in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> last Tuesday, <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> said: `` He certainly did not finish off a bottle and a half of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. The entire delegation of five Soviets drank a bottle. But for five Soviet men to drink a bottle of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, that's normal That's the culture. Soviets tend to drink a lot.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> suffered from jet lag and a hectic schedule, and by the time he spoke in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>, `` he had not slept for three nights.'' <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> said he personally called off a scheduled appearance by <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` Nightline,'' to be taped last Monday, the afternoon before the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> speech. `` I canceled it because he was jet-lagged. He was just dropping,'' <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On the day the appearance was canceled, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had no alcohol, said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> also denied that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had blown his lecture fees on a shopping spree. On Sunday night, <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> said, he and <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> signed an agreement to use the proceeds of the lecture tour `` toward eradicating AIDs in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Esalen </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, is a non-profit institution that deals in exchange programs with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The fund will ship `` $ 100,000 worth of medical equipment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, primarily in the form of disposable syringes,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>. `` All the bills are not in yet, but he is going to earn roughly $ 20,000 to $ 40,000'' from the lecture tour, said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>. `` The gross was close to $ 160,000 to $ 170,000.'' The speakers' bureau will take 30 percent, and much of the balance will pay the costs of the nine-person entourage. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> `` will accept none of the proceeds. All of the proceeds will go to buy medical equipment,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>. The AIDs program will be run by <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s parliamentary office in the Moskva Hotel off Red Square and by the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Innovation </ORGANIZATION>, which has offices in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We gave him $ 100 a day as a per diem. So he had $ 900 of personal money. That is all he had,'' said <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON>. `` He sent his aide out to buy a few things, basically children's clothes, <PERSON> Levis </PERSON> and toys for his grandchildren.'' Additionally, <PERSON> Esalen </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> a personal computer for his parliamentary office, he said.

 Stampeded. Plucked. Left in the Dust. The angry headlines in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> newspapers said it all. The CBS miniseries, `` Lonesome Dove,'' a saga of western frontier life, got barely a nod from the television industry in Sunday night's Emmy awards and Texans were n't happy about it. `` It's something that you ca n't help feeling bitter or upset about,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Human </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> actress who portrayed the bossy and buxom `` Peach.'' The epic depicted a cattle drive from dusty Lonesome Dove, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. It's central characters were two aging <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> portrayed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Although `` Lonesome Dove'' gathered a leading seven trophies including Saturday's technical ceremony, the adaptation of <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurtry </PERSON>'s acclaimed novel won only one key category Sunday, for director <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wincer </PERSON>. It received 18 nominations, more than any show. `` I just wish the people who were more vitally involved with it got the recognition they needed to get,'' said Ms. Human. `` It kind of gives me the impression that somebody woke up with a sore tooth when they voted _ that's how ridiculous it is.'' Sore heads might have been involved, too, Ms. <PERSON> Human </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Duval </PERSON> is a very talented person, but he's also a very strong person and a lot of times, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> does n't like that. ... But, there's no way you're going to know for sure.'' A television critic at the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> called the decision `` an unbelievable lapse in judgment.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> `` embarrassed itself by refusing to honor ` Lonesome Dove' as the season's finest miniseries,'' <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> wrote. The winner of that category was the monumental <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> saga `` War and Remembrance.'' Many industry watchers thought <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> had a virtual lock on a best actor Emmy for his portrayal of the talkative <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Ranger Gus. The award went instead to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, who played the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie `` My Name is Bill W.'' Even <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, the executive producer of `` War and Remembrance,'' called his victory `` a major shock.''

 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> says he's satisfied <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials investigating the explosion that killed 47 sailors on the USS Iowa did `` the best job they could. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told reporters Monday he had no reason to question the finding that gunners mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> apparently caused the blast by inserting a detonating device between bags of gunpowder in the ship's ill-fated No. 2 gun turret `` I do think it's important to point out that the information or the evidence that's available is incomplete,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in his first extensive public statement about the report. `` We'll never know with absolute certainty exactly what transpired because of the nature of the incident itself,'' he said. In the report issued earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the blast apparently was caused by a detonating device between bags of gunpowder and that the <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, the gun captain at the time, was the most likely person to have sabotaged the firing. The report said uncertainty remains, however, because all the witnesses died in the explosion. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials also said they had ruled out technical reason for the blast after conducting some 20,000 tests on the gunpowder and guns used aboard the ship. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> did the best job they could under the circumstances on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. I think the investigation ... was a good one,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the service did `` a good technical job of checking out all conceivable possibilities by which that incident might have occurred, such as an accident because of the gunpowder exploding prematurely or some other such thing.'' `` I am satisfied with that aspect of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family has criticized the report for singling him out, but <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, the investigating officer, was required to provide his best conclusion on what happened. `` That's what he's done,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. `` I do n't have any reason to question it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that experiments were being conducted on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> using an improper number of powder bags combined with the heaviest-weight type of projectile. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Monday that experiments took place, but that they did n't cause the explosion. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Milligen </PERSON> had included information about the unauthorized tests in his report, and had mentioned the unauthorized use of five bags instead of six bags of powder in the No. 2 gun turret, which exploded. `` The improper loading configuration did not cause, nor did it contribute to, the explosion,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. `` Ditto for the powder.'' The report says such experiments had been conducted aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> from Nov. 4, 1987 until the day of the explosion. The report also notes <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> captain, had approved the use of reduced charge loads, but that he thought that meant six 55-pound bags of powder instead of the larger bags of around 90-110 pounds. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> did not have the authority to approve such tests, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. The report called for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general to look into the unauthorized tests, and Rear Adm. <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> plans to do so, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> said. Because of the many improper procedures found aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, such as the gunpowder experiments, it has been left to Adm. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, to decide whether disciplinary action might be taken. The battleship currently is in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>.

 Educators already strapped by tight budgets as they seek to improve classroom achievements face billions of dollars in maintenance and construction costs in the next few years, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says. Local school districts, which historically have been responsible for running and paying for their school buildings, have seen maintenance costs increase 64 percent since 1983 _ to $ 41 billion, according to a report the governors' association issued Monday. In addition, existing plans to renovate or build schools are expected to cost $ 84 billion, the association's annual 50-state survey said, warning the costs could undercut direct education programs. `` The projected costs for new school construction and maintenance and repairs for existing schools are so enormous that they can overwhelm policy-makers,'' said the report, called `` Results in Education: 1989.'' `` When these estimates are broken down on a per-student or annual basis over a 20-year period, the price tag may seem more manageable. Still, unless addressed, the problem will mount as aging suburban schools reach the end of their intended life span and urban and rural schools deteriorate further.'' The association said rural schools are particularly pressed, noting another report that described half of the rural schools as being unsafe, outdated and inadequate. In addition, the report said many school districts are seeing money drained from their budgets to finance litigation because of lawsuits. Several states are considering measures to relieve the pressure on local officials by providing state support for school construction costs, said the report. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, the association president, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> released the report a week before the education summit the governors will have with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It is time for us as governors to pay careful attention to what is being taught in our schools and to what students are expected to learn,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` Governors are powerful agents of change and the report that we submit today is evidence of that fact.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the heart of this report is not so much in what the states are doing, but in the introduction and unfinished agenda sections that tell us what we have yet to do to turn our public schools around.'' Key findings of the report included: _ 32 states are improving teacher recruitment and retention Five states now have teacher licensing boards on which a majority of the members are administrators and teachers. Thirteen states are trying to increase the number of minority teachers. _ 41 states report new, expanded or proposed parent involvement policies, including 16 with programs to assist parents in becoming effective teachers at home _ 31 states now offer pre-school and other early childhood programs and 34 states offer alternative programs for high schools _ Nearly half the states use computers to maintain student records, train teachers, evaluate curriculum and instruct students `` Simply stated, restructuring means that we are trying to find better ways to organize our schools, to prepare our teachers and to determine what students must know and be able to do,'' said <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Cheney Promises More Aggressive Pentagon Role in Drug Fight</HEAD>

 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, promising a `` more aggressive'' Pentagon role in the international drug battle, is giving regional military leaders a month to come up with details to carry it out. `` I think the relative level of effort _ compared to what has been done in the past _ will be significantly greater,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> pledged when he announced his project at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing on Monday. In an attempt to fulfill the Pentagon role as the nation's lead agency in the drug interdiction effort, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> acknowledges that the agency may `` have to make some tradeoffs'' because of ever-shrinking budgets. But he said the new attentiveness toward illicit narcotics as a national security threat should not `` in any way conflict with our basic mission of defending the country.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he had told the heads of the various major military commands to draw up plans by Oct. 15 to use planes, ships, radar and troops to help stem the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The secretary said he could not estimate the cost of the effort, nor the number of servicemen and women needed, until the commanders report back to him. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will emphasize stopping drugs from entering the country, but also will help fight drug abuse and aid other nations in attacking drugs at their source. `` I hope that our interdiction efforts will be more successful in the future in part because we've got more aggressive efforts now underway in the host countries and a greater willingness for them to cooperate in our efforts,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. He said the Pentagon planned `` a more aggressive and robust posture'' to help President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> implement his anti-drug fight in the Andean nations, as well. Until now, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s role has been to support the efforts of state <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units, which have been used for such duties as inspecting cargo at ports of entry, taking part in aerial searches for marijuana crops and helping transport law enforcement officials or contraband. Those efforts have varied from state to state. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> insisted that in no case would the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> be drawn into a law enforcement role. Nor, he said, will <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces overseas be sent into combat. `` There's a clear line out there,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, that the military will not cross. `` It's a dangerous business. I hope nobody's hurt in the process, but I ca n't guarantee it,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, adding that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel are acting under rules of engagement that allow them to defend themselves. Asked whether he backed shooting down planes that refuse to identify themselves and are suspected of smuggling drugs, as some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have suggested, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the department has no such authority and does not intend to ask for it. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the department intends to deploy `` appropriate elements of the Armed Forces'' to help reduce the flow of drugs into the country, but cited no specific numbers or types of military personnel. Among other things, the secretary said, he has asked the commanders to: _ Plan for a `` substantial <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> counter-narcotics task force, with appropriate planes and ships,'' to cut the drug flow from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ Study the use of military forces to support the counter-drug work of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law enforcement agencies, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and `` cooperating foreign governments,'' in particular <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ Examine for the use of high-tech facilities available at <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to help detect illegal drug traffic coming across the nation's borders _ Find ways of combating the production and trafficking of illegal drugs in conjunction with unnamed `` cooperating host countries.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans concede President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug strategy needs some work, but their talks with Democrats have left the two sides without agreement so far on how it should be reshaped Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators planned to meet again today in their search for a package of anti-drug measures agreeable to lawmakers of both parties. The bargaining, which began Friday, is being fueled by both sides' claim to the lead role in attacking illegal drugs and drug-related crimes, issues party leaders say are uppermost on the public's mind. A two-hour session Monday evening produced no deal. Republicans emerged saying they still supported the $ 7.9 billion package for fiscal 1990, beginning Oct. 1, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined Sept. 5. And Democrats said they remained behind the $ 10.1 billion plan they countered with a week later, a proposal that garnered a quick veto threat from <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides. `` I do n't think we're at the point yet where we know what they're proposing, other than the president's plan,'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, author of the Democratic plan, said after A general profile of a compromise that might ultimately arise did, however, begin to emerge. Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the Republican's chief negotiator, said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers `` are willing to help narrow the gap'' between the two sides' spending proposals for treatment and prevention programs. The Democrats want more emphasis on those initiatives than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> also said Republicans supported the Democratic concept of paying for the extra anti-drug spending by cutting other programs across the board. He said the amount the Democrats want to slice off other programs would have to be reduced, and indicated other changes in their plan might be sought as well. `` We agree on more than we disagree upon,'' <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, which would increase spending over this year's efforts by $ 2.2 billion, would be weighted heavily to law enforcement, prisons and interdiction Prevention and treatment programs would get 27 percent of the total. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> proposed not only beefing up the president's package but changing the distribution. Of the $ 10.1 billion <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> proposes, 65 percent would go to law enforcement and 35 percent to prevention and treatment. That plan, backed by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders, would finance its costs by snipping 0.575 percent from most of the budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> identified how he would pay for only about $ 750 million of his proposal, suggesting cuts in a half-dozen other programs. Democrats said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan does not throw enough of a financial punch at the problem. Before <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> introduced his measure, some Democrats said new taxes are needed to adequately finance anti-drug initiatives. But Republicans have complained the Democratic alternative is too costly and provides too much to prevention programs. They also object to the $ 1.8 billion slice the across-the-board cuts would take out of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 300 billion budget.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he has no `` hard evidence'' his family has been threatened by drug lords, although members of his family are reported to be getting extra security. `` I ca n't say I'm totally unconcerned, but I do n't have any hard evidence that should further alarm the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people in this context,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said when asked whether he knew of threats against his family. `` Clearly any such action would I think just bring down the entire wrath of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and the American government,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> on a two-day western trip.

The June cancellation was an attempt to avoid a worsening political controversy over the use of federal funds by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> to back controversial works, the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>'s director, <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr-Cahall </PERSON>, has said The action, however, seemed to have attracted more attention to the issue on all sides, and many artists have denounced the <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>, the nation's oldest art museum.

The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has enacted such a provision in the endowment's appropriations bill; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has refused to go along and simply voted to reduce the appropriation by $ 45,000 The two versions will have to be reconciled.

<HEAD>FCC Decision to Waive Radio Operator Requirement Sparks Concern</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil companies have obtained waivers from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate radio officers on many tankers, a cost-cutting move that critics contend will increase the chances of oil spills. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> requirement that all large ships carry at least one trained radio officer originated in the 1930s, when ships needed someone skilled in the pit-pat-pit of <LOCATION> Morse </LOCATION> code, says <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. `` Since that kind of radio telegraphy is obsolete, there's no longer a need for a job category like this on these merchant ships,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday. But two unions _ the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represent about 600 sea-going officers _ are objecting to the waivers on safety grounds. With support from some ship captains, they contend that every large merchant ship should carry someone trained to repair radio equipment and handle communications during an emergency, leaving the captain and mates free to supervise other operations, such as firefighting and damage control. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s critics point to the case of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION>, which in April suffered an apparent breakdown of an electronic fuel sensor that left it drifting aimlessly off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> for nearly seven hours with 22 million gallons of oil aboard. The ship's radio officer, who had been eliminated under an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> waiver just a few weeks earlier, might have quickly solved the problem because of the officer's expertise in electronics, they claim. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, however, says it is doubtful that a radio officer would have made a difference in the case. The company also maintains it has ensured safe communications on its tankers by installing duplicate radio systems and training various crewmembers to operate them. `` This is just a false issue raised by certain unions trying to capitalize on the unfortunate Alaskan oil spill,'' said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON>, an adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on international shipping, said the government began granting waivers in 1982 to eliminate radio operators on U.S.-registered oil tankers and large cargo vessels operating along the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coast. Despite objections by more than a dozen environmental groups, those coastal waivers have continued and additional waivers have been extended this year on a ship-by-ship basis to 30 to 40 other vessels plying the waters from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> said the simplicity and sophistication of automated and satellite communications `` eliminate the need for the intermediate operator any more.'' Some companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, the shipping arm of <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, have decided to retain radio specialists, primarily because of their ability to make repairs. But more than half a dozen major shippers, including <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sunoco </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, have applied for and received new waivers, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> contended that technological improvements, including ship-to-satellite transmitters and snap-in circuit boards, have made communications more reliable than ever. `` It's far safer now, when the guy in charge on the bridge can just pick up a phone and have instantaneous, voice-to-voice contact with points all over the globe,'' he said. `` Morse code and all that is just not necessary any more.'' But a ship's captain, speaking to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity, said the added responsibility for communications could be a problem in an emergency. `` What if I get in trouble?'' he said. `` Say my ship is on fire, or I send an S.O.S. Do I stay on the bridge and direct firefighting, or do I go in the radio room? Where am I supposed to go now?''

 A teen-ager known as `` Iron Man'' was charged with four slayings in his neighborhood after he made incriminating statements that clinched his connection to the crimes, police said. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 15, was arraigned Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> under heavy security because of death threats. Under state law he can not be charged as an adult and if found delinquent faces no more than six years in juvenile prison. The 240-pound, 5-foot-10 Price was described by friends and neighbors as a popular, rambunctious youth more inclined to football than studies. He was arrested Sunday at his home, a block from the house where he allegedly beat and stabbed to death a woman and her two daughters during Labor Day weekend, and two doors from the house of a woman stabbed to death in 1987. A search of Price's house produced evidence including a weapon that may have been used killings, Police Chief <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. He declined to describe the items. `` We have physical evidence to tie in every step along the way,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said, although he indicated Price's self-incriminating statements were the primary evidence in the 1987 case. Judge <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPetrillo </PERSON> ordered Price held at the state <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He scheduled a hearing Thursday for prosecutors to detail evidence. About 30 people gathered outside the courthouse, including some of Price's friends who claimed he could not have killed anyone. Sheriff <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> said all 22 officers on his force in this town of about 90,000 people were called in because `` you get disgruntled neighbors, angry neighbors and you have to protect against something happening.'' Price is charged with three counts of deliquency first-degree murder and one count of burglary in the deaths of <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON>, 39, and her daughters, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 8, who were found in their home Sept. 4. He is charged with one count of deliquency first-degree murder and one count of deliquency burglary in the 1987 stabbing of <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 27. If found delinquent, Price could be held at the juvenile prison only until age 21, said state Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>. Price was a suspect in the <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> killings `` right from the start'' because of a cut on his hand and his conflicting statements about it, said <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. `` If you wish to call it a confession you can refer to it as that _ but he gave a statement to the investigating detectives which would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both homicides,'' <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, however, said the motive is uncertain. An autopsy revealed the three victims had bruises and numerous broken bones, apparently from a struggle with their killer, leading police to speculate the killer might have been cut or injured. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON>, 18, a friend of Price's who waited outside the courthouse, said he lived with the Prices until a few days ago and Price showed him a cut left index finger when <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> returned home at about 1 a.m. Sept. 2. `` You could see the bone on one side. It was deep,'' <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said. Price told him he had punched out a car window, <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> said. Police have said an intruder broke into the <PERSON> Heaton </PERSON> home through a rear window. Price, who played varsity football last year, was ineligible to play this year because he had been held back in the ninth grade. His mother, father and older brother attended the hearing but had no comment. Price's lawyer, public defender <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marro </PERSON>, declined to comment.

 A heavily armed teen-ager apparently acting out author <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s thriller `` Rage'' took 11 classmates hostage during a daylong standoff that ended with his surrender after nine hours, authorities said. No injuries were reported. <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, a 17-year-old, straight-A student, was detained by police Monday evening after he released his last two hostages, laid down three guns and surrendered. Charges were not immediately filed. A copy of `` Rage'' and some personal writings found in <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s room at his grandparent's house were helpful in giving negotiators clues to what he planned, said state police Detective <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, who negotiated with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said he had been worried by parts of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s writing that indicated `` suicide was what we'd have to deal with at the end.'' In King's novel, a teen-ager enraged at his father takes hostages at a school, is shot and wounded by police and ends up in an institution. Like the character in the book, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was upset with his father, whom he had not seen for 13 years, and asked to see him, authorities said. Police arranged to have the father, whose name was not released, brought from <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> surrendered before his arrival. The trouble appears to have begun Sunday evening when <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s friend <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> picked him up at his grandparents' house so the two could study together, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>'s uncle When it became late and they had not returned, authorities were called and began searching for <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>'s red pickup truck. The standoff began around 9:30 a.m. Monday, when <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> roared into the high school parking lot aboard the truck. Authorities said that at some point during the disappearance <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> pointed a gun at <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, in effect abducting him. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, the son of high school principal <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, was the first hostage released. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON>, a 16-year-old junior, was in the classroom when <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> entered. `` He shot the ceiling and told the teacher to leave and let two rows of students leave,'' <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> said. Later, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> fired his only other shot, blowing out a classroom window. Throughout the day, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> traded food, cigarettes and soft drinks for hostages. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was solicitous of his hostages, asking for cigarettes on their behalf and even releasing one who needed to go to the bathroom. `` He said he was n't going to hurt nobody,'' <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> said. `` He said he was n't going to shoot nobody.'' After <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s arrival, the students he first released warned others and the classrooms were cleared. <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was armed with a .357 - caliber Magnum revolver, a .44 - caliber revolver and a .12 gauge shotgun that `` It looked like one you'd see in a movie,'' <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> said. More than a dozen state police officers went to the school just south of <PERSON> McKee </PERSON>, a town of about 1,000 people some 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>. Police were concerned about references in <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s writing to dying at 9 o'clock. `` He said it'll all end at 9,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. `` We did n't want that 9 o'clock hour.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> surrendered at 6:30 p.m. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, who had gone to school with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> since fourth grade, called him a quiet, straight-A student who liked guns. `` Many of the school reports <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> did dealt with war,'' she said. After taking over the classroom, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s only persistent demand was to talk to his father, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. `` He has n't seen his father, my understanding, since he's 4 years old,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had lived with his grandparents for several years. Near the end of the standoff, police called on a cousin and close friend of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s to convince him no harm would come to him. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, an 18-year-old freshman at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said he and his cousin talked about hunting. `` I just talked like I always do,'' <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> said. `` He was calm, pretty smooth. He started to cry a little bit when I was talking.'' At that point, tired and tense, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was looking for a way to end the standoff, <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said. `` He wanted to know how many crimes he committed,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said.

 Federal officials praised <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to reduce the wholesale price of AZT by 20 percent, but some AIDS activists say the cut is n't deep enough. `` This is a step in the right direction, but a very small step,'' says <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> of the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. `` It's not enough.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday that it will lower the wholesale cost of the only federally approved AIDS treatment, citing production efficiencies and research that suggests an increasing demand for the drug. `` The expected growth in patient population, coupled with recent production economies, will reduce somewhat our financial risk and will remove some of the uncertainties which existed when this drug was first introduced,'' said T.E. <PERSON> Haigler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON>' president and chief executive officer. The company said, however, it could n't guarantee that the full savings will be passed on to consumers, who have been paying $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 per year for full doses of the drug. The reduction cuts the price to the wholesale distributor from $ 1.50 to $ 1.20 per capsule. A patient now paying almost $ 8,000 a year for a high-dose, 12 capsule-a-day prescription of AZT would pay more than $ 6,500 a year with the lower price. People who are infected with the virus but who have few or no symptoms of AIDS generally have a five-capsules-a-day prescription, and would see their costs reduced to about $ 2,700 a year. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said the price cut, combined with recent findings that lower dosages may be effective, will reduce the cost of AZT treatment. `` This is good news for those infected with HIV who can benefit from AZT treatment, and it is good news for the health care system as a whole,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The cut was announced after mounting protests by AIDS activists against <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, five people chained themselves to a banister at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to protest the cost of AZT, also called Retrovir. Activists argued that some AIDS patients could not afford the drug and that the price discouraged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from renewing a program that subsidizes the cost of the medicine for patients who can not afford it. The medical establishment also criticized prices of AZT and other AIDS drugs last week. In an article published Friday in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, researchers blamed `` price gouging by drug companies'' for part of the estimated $ 5 billion annually it may someday cost to care for AIDS victims. Company spokesman <PERSON> Thack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> insisted that the protests did not affect <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. `` Actually, I can say the protests slowed things down a little bit,'' he said. `` We had to field inquiries from the media and other people about what we planned to do at a time when we were still trying to decide what that would be.'' <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, whose group is know as ACTUP, said activists will continue to press for lower prices. `` ACTUP will continue to fight to make sure that all AIDS treatments are provided to all who need them, free of charge, which means we will continue to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> for further price reductions,'' he said. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the price cut `` is large enough to characterize it as being in good faith, but it remains to be seen whether it's enough.'' She added that activists will continue to assess <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON>' profit margin `` We hope that as the market increases, we will continue to see <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> make good faith assessments about future reductions,'' she said. AZT was first shown to be effective against HIV infection in September 1986. A trial of the drug revealed a significantly lower mortality rate among patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS-related complex who had received AZT. During the next six months, <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> made AZT available free to about 5,000 patients. The company lowered the cost 20 percent in 1987. AZT was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987.

 The dollar ended lower against the Japanese yen Tuesday, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index fell marginally. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 1.47 points, or 0.004 percent, closing at 34,471.07. It had gained 70.66 points the previous day. The dollar closed at 145.73 yen, down 0.70 yen from Monday's close of 146.43 yen It opened at 145.70 yen, and moved between 145.59 yen and 146.15 yen. Although the index gained some 100 points soon after the market opened, it turned downward as some market players stopped buying and others sold for profit-taking, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` There was no specific element that reversed the upswing. It seemed that participants could not figure out what they should do next after buying aggressively,'' he said. Other dealers said the index started higher as market players were reassured by the yen's rebound against the dollar, but it fell back due to speculative investors' selling to make technical adjustments. In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving nervously around the 146-yen level after opening lower, following a similar downswing on overseas markets overnight, traders said.

 An uncharacteristically taciturn <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> heeded a judge's warning to refrain from comment about issues surrounding her cop-slapping trial. `` I'm under gagging order,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> told reporters in the halls of <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> as her trial entered its second week Monday. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> faces four misdemeanor charges: battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and having an open container of alcohol in her car. If convicted, she could be sentenced to 18 months behind bars. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> uttered `` no comment'' more than seven times when questioned by reporters. She even said `` no comment'' when asked about her ensemble of white slacks and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> blue blazer. Last week, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said she was afraid of going to jail because of lesbians there. She also made unflattering remarks about the prosecutor -LRB- `` He has a Napoleon complex'' -RRB- and called the policeman she is accused of striking an `` Adonis'' and `` a liar.'' Besides the gag order warning, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> told reporters, `` My mother is very upset and -LRB- sister -RRB- <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> could kill me'' regarding the publicity accompanying the trial. In testimony Monday, prosecution witness <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON> said she was looking in her rear-view mirror when she saw Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> being struck on June 14. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> had pulled over Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> for having expired registration tags. As he checked for other violations, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> allegedly drove off, was stopped again and ultimately slapped <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s face. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> has said the slap was unprovoked. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, a foot-shorter and 100 pounds lighter than <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, has said she struck in self defense. For the defense, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> physician testified that Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> `` was hurting all over'' after her arrest. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpman </PERSON>, a cardiovascular specialist, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> called him after the incident and complained of `` anxiety and nervousness and pain and discomfort.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Elconin </PERSON>, an orthopedic surgeon, said he saw bruises on Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s wrists when she visited him two days after her arrest. The bruises probably were caused by handcuffs, <PERSON> Elconin </PERSON> said. A third defense witness, Dr. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohenzadeh </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> used excessive force when he was pulled over for speeding two years ago. `` I've never felt so threatened in my life,'' <PERSON> Cohenzadeh </PERSON> said, claiming the officer threw him down on the ground. The defense has contended that the officer has a history of being abusive with people he has pulled over for traffic violations.

 <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, the ebullient announcer of the popular television game show `` Let's Make a Deal,'' shot and killed himself at his home. He was 71. Officers were called to the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> home after neighbors and relatives reported hearing a gunshot, police detective <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuster </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, whose real name was <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Fix </PERSON>, was pronounced dead at the scene. `` Let's Make A Deal,'' with host <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, was first shown on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1963 and later moved to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> until 1976. The show also was seen in syndication and more recently was revived by the USA Cable network. It is not in production now, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said Monday through a spokesman. `` <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was a member of our ` Let's Make a Deal' family for 13 years,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. `` His booming voice and his bubbly personality endeared him to millions. Those of us who worked with him on a daily basis appreciated his talents. He was more than an announcer, he was my co-star and my friend.'' `` Let's Make a Deal'' opened with a drum roll and <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s voice over a shot of three numbered doors. Contestants were selected from the audience, whose members wore costumes. A popular feature was `` <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>'s Tray,'' which contained a hidden item, sometimes valuable, sometimes not. The announcer brought the tray to <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who then bargained with a contestant over its value. <PERSON> Kuster </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> shot himself as he stood just outside the entrance to the detached garage of his home Sunday morning. He left a note, and a will, said <PERSON> Kuster </PERSON>, who declined to give further details. Early this year, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> retired from announcing and became an agent for emcees and announcers, specializing in game shows, said talent agent <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said the death came as `` a complete shock to all of us. As far as we knew his health was fine. ... He was always a very positive, ` up' kind of person.'' The note left behind, according to <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>, gave a different perspective. `` <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> said he had been hurting for a long, long time,'' <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> was a native of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. His first job in radio was at <ORGANIZATION> WBOW </ORGANIZATION> in Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. From there he went to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s WLW as an announcer and emcee. In 1943, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> got a job at <ORGANIZATION> KNX </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> radio station in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. During his career he announced for several radio and television shows, including the `` <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Hour,'' `` Carnation Family Party,'' and `` It's Fun to Be Young.'' He is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON>, and two daughters. Funeral arrangements were pending.

 People in the capital emerged from shelter onto streets scattered with shards of glass, chunks of concrete, snapped palm trees and tons of debris that attracted plenty of scavengers. Travel was treacherous after Hurricane Hugo's 125 mph winds snapped power lines across this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island's hard-hit northeastern sections as the storm skirted the coast on a north-northwestern tack Monday. Flooding was widespread, with surging waters reaching up to the hoods of cars. The high water forced this correspondent to turn back after attempting to reach the international airport, where damaged planes included a DC-3 that had been tossed onto a hangar. Authorities said nearly 28,000 people lost homes in the storm. There were no immediate reports of deaths. Bands of youths looted stores in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, while others scavenged rubble and metal from storm-damaged buildings. Some carted away truckloads of aluminium siding and zinc roofing. People on foot struggled to carry loads they could barely handle. In the ritzy <LOCATION> Condado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> neighborhood, perhaps the city's worst-hit area, most hotels had windows blown out and hotel awnings lay shattered on the ground Many palm trees were uprooted, others lost their fronds. As the storm receded and dusk fell, clean-up crews started work with bulldozers to remove the debris from city streets. Waist-deep waters in some areas of the city prevented any salvage work. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> remained in total darkness Monday night, with no estimate of when power might be returned to the capital. Communication with the outside world, completely cut during the storm's height, was gradually being restored. Six hours after the worst winds, thousands of people cruised <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>'s streets in cars, looking at the damage and causing traffic jams citywide. Residents of one <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> neighborhood said its tall buildings swayed in the winds, and one said it felt like being aboard a ship. The rain blew sideways and pieces of metal and other debris flew through the air. In a boutique on the ground floor of the two-story building housing the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, young looters defied winds hitting 100 mph at the height of the storm and carried out armloads of women's clothing. The AP buro's office was nearly destroyed in the storm by broken glass and rain. A giant Banyan tree lay across a major avenue, its roots sticking in the air. The Bal do Rioty avenue, which leads from the hotel zone to the international airport, was lined with fallen almond trees. Many cars lay damaged by fallen trees and one car was completely flattened by a concrete slab from a nearby building. In a working-class section of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, utility poles tilted for blocks with wires dangling, making streets nearly impassable.

<HEAD>Generals, Admirals Facing Human Rights Charges To Be Pardoned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> says he will pardon 18 retired generals and admirals who face charges they committed hundreds of human rights abuses in the 1970s during the armed forces' war on leftists. The cases of six other people, including two former presidents already convicted and sentenced, will be considered at a later date, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said late Sunday in a brief interview with state-run television. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who took office in July, said ordered the pardon `` for the good of my country'' and due to the `` need for reconciliation to pacify <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. `` It is not possible to continue living in an ignominious past that wounds us all,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> told Channel 7. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s statement was the first firm indication of who would be included in the controversial pardon, expected to be formally announced after his return Sept. 28 from a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` This is getting worse and worse,'' said <PERSON> Hebe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonafini </PERSON>, founder of the Mothers of the <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION>, a group made up of relatives of people who disappeared during the 1970s. `` All the military is responsible for what happened _ for the kidnappings, the torture and the disappearances.'' Sixteen retired generals and two admirals face trial in civilian courts on hundreds of charges, including kidnapping, torture and murder, growing out of a brutal campaign conducted against leftists during the 1976-83 military regime. Six others were convicted of similar charges in 1984 and are serving terms ranging from eight years to life at a military prison. They are former military presidents <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commanders Adms. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Massera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambruschini </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> provincial police chiefs <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. Ramon Camps and <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Riccheri </PERSON>. A government commission named by <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s predecessor, former President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, determined that at least 8,900 Argentines disappeared during the anti-subversion campaign and were presumed dead. Human rights groups have accused the armed forces of genocide. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who took office July 8, made no reference to former leftist guerrilla leader <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Firmenich </PERSON>, now serving a 30-year sentence for kidnapping and murder. Unconfirmed reports have indicated his case might be considered along with those of the convicted military men. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> repeatedly has said he intends to resolve the `` military question'' before the end of the year and put an end to civilian-military tension stemming from the trials of officers. But the possibility of a pardon has angered human rights groups, who organized a Sept. 8 opposition march in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> and other major cities. Government officials said Monday the pardon also would include military officers facing disciplinary action for taking part in three insurrections in April 1987 and January and December 1988, during the <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> presidency. The revolts, which were quelled with little bloodshed, were aimed at ending the military trials. The number of those officers facing action never has been announced, but they are estimated to total about 100, including Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>, leader of the first two revolts, and Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, who led the third.

<HEAD>Last Day of Storm Brings Tornadoes as Grape Growers Assess Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thunderstorms and heavy rains drenched northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a third day, dashing hopes of a fruitful grape harvest in the region's wine country. `` We were talking about a very large chardonnay crop this year. We can forget about quantity now and we'll have to see about quality,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckstoffer </PERSON>, the biggest wine grape supplier in <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> with 2,000 acres. Growers in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mendocino </LOCATION> counties worked in the fields and hoped for sunshine as the sun broke through clouds Monday afternoon after three days of rain. The deluge drenched the vineyards, threatening more than 11,000 acres of grapes that can fetch about $ 1,800 a ton or more. Wine producers were most concerned about the chardonnay and sauvignon blanc fruit, which had been close to maturity before the storm _ the remnants of Hurricane Octave _ struck. The growers hoped hot, dry weather, or at least cool and windy weather, would help negate the effects of the rain. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast fair and warmer weather today and warm, dry weather the rest of the week. `` There's going to be some rot, even if the sun comes out now and everything turns out right,'' said <PERSON> Beckstoffer </PERSON>, whose workers began pulling the leaves out of the bottom of the vines to help them dry faster. `` The thing that scares me is that this -LRB- rain -RRB- might not end. We might be in for the start of cold, wet winter.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Sebastiani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vineyards </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION>, vice president and executive winemaster <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he could see some bunch rot already, especially on the tissue-paper thin skin of chardonnay and sauvignon blanc grapes. Most of the approximately 190 vineyards in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> grow the threatened grapes. Champagne grapes, which mature earlier, escaped the damage. Red wine grapes, harvested in October, also were expected to be in good shape. The cost of picking the white wine grapes is likely to soar because of the weather. Picking them selectively takes longer and could push labor costs from about $ 100 a ton per farm worker up to about $ 140 a ton. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Burch </PERSON>, whose family has owned <ORGANIZATION> Mallard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> for five generations, reserved helicopters to blow their crops dry when the rain stops. They said this is the first time in more than 10 years that they have had to use helicopters to save a crop.

 The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index declined by a tiny fraction. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 1.47 points, or 0.004 percent, closing at 34,471.07. It had gained 70.66 points the previous day. The dollar closed at 145.73 yen, down 0.70 yen from Monday's 146.43-yen finish It opened at 145.70 yen and ranged between 145.59 yen and 146.15 yen. Currency trading was inactive, said <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON>, a senior trader with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` Although quite a few market players have had long dollar holding positions, they did n't sell as many dollars as we had expected, mainly because they had no dollar-selling incentives,'' he said. `` The market's major concern was whether <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- group of seven industrial -RRB- nations can reach agreement on how to work on international interest rate gaps,'' <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> said. `` The problem is that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does n't seem to have made up its mind on what to do with its interest rates and the rising dollar,'' he added. Many market players remained on the sidelines ahead of a G-7 meeting this weekend, traders said. Participating in the meeting, opening Saturday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, will be monetary officials and central bankers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. On the stock exchange, the market's main barometer gained about 100 points in early trading but fell back again, dealers said. <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nomura </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said market players avoided major moves except for technical adjustments involving some companies whose account settlements for the first half of fiscal 1989 year are scheduled for Wednesday. `` The index rose back a bit toward the end of the afternoon session as market players bought for their arbitrage deals,'' he said. Arbitrage is a common technique to make profits out of prices gap between the spot and futures markets. <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> said many stock market players were deeply concerned about the dollar's recent strength, which has been the major discouraging factor in the market. Trading was inactive, with first section volume estimated at 650 million shares, up from Monday's 450 million.

 The federal government, Puerto Rican communities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and voluntary relief agencies have started relief efforts to help communities struck by Hurricane Hugo. The mobilization came as the storm lashed <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> after battering the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and other tourist havens, leaving at least 14 people dead and tens of thousands homeless. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of the Interior <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, attending a conference in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> with top officials of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, said Monday $ 500,000 in emergency assistance funds have been released to aid the storm-stricken areas. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said he will leave <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Wednesday night to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to plan a tour of the devastation in the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> said late Monday that <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> left at least 27,900 people homeless. He said he would ask President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to declare the island a disaster area. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, bank accounts, hotlines and phone-a-thons are being set up by the city's <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> community to aid hurricane victims. The Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an organization run by the Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, began to coordinate disaster relief efforts by churches, banks and individuals around the city. `` I have my whole family there _ my mother, my sister, my friends, my aunts, my grandmother,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Noemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the agency. `` I talked to them last night. I have n't any information today You can tell how I feel _ I'm worried.'' Meanwhile, an organization of voluntary relief agencies urged the public to donate cash rather than goods in an effort to avoid problems that have occurred during several past disasters, when agencies were inundated with unneeded goods that hampered delivery of needed items. For example, people donated 1,000 pairs of high-heeled shoes to victims of a Mexican earthquake, while boots and wool sweaters were offered to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> after a hurricane last year and earthquake victims in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> got 7,000 bras. `` Goods should not be collected or sent unless they have been requested by the disaster-stricken country or private voluntary organizations,'' said InterAction, a membership group of relief agencies. When a need is identified following a disaster, local <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> chapters can help report which supplies are needed, InterAction suggested. Otherwise, cash is the best way to make a contribution, because relief workers can then purchase goods that are actually needed, officials said. InterAction represents about 120 voluntary relief organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, CARE, Save the Children, World Vision, <ORGANIZATION> Oxfam </ORGANIZATION> and the Christian Children's Fund. New Yorkers with roots in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> hoped for the best. <PERSON> Pilar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alamo </PERSON>, who has lived in the city for five years, said she last spoke to her family Sunday. `` They had candles and a small gas stove and tried to board up a couple of glass windows,'' said <PERSON> Alamo </PERSON>, whose siblings, parents and grandparents live together in <LOCATION> Bayamon </LOCATION>. `` They live in a cement house but it's always worse in the poorer communities where they live in shacks or wooden houses.''

 A businessman has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for conspiring to send <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> deadly nerve gas, which the prosecutor called a weapon of genocide. <PERSON> Juwhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 48, will serve no more than 22 months because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> gave him credit for time served after the Jan. 12 arrest. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was convicted May 19 of conspiring to export arms illegally. In his sentencing Monday, <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> said the weapon _ the nerve gas sarin _ had the capability of inflicting massive casualties. But the judge noted that there was no chance of the gas ever leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s arms contact was in fact an undercover <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent. He also said it was questionable whether <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> ever would have committed a crime if the agent, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON>, had not intervened. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, in addressing <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>, blamed <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON> for his troubles. `` I still believe I am victim of Mr. <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON>, for his achievement and advancement,'' he said. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> also accused the government of racism in targeting him, a Korean-American, because of his heavy accent. Customs agents were tipped off by a former agent then working for a legitimate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> arms company who had been telephoned by <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> regarding an ammunition deal. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, who owned a trading company called <ORGANIZATION> Komex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in Summit, conspired to ship 500 quarter-ton bombs to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through a British arms dealer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>. `` I think we were outraged by the charge he was targeted because he was an Oriental. There was a good reason for starting this investigation,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who called the sentence fair and appropriate. Defense attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dratch </PERSON> promised to appeal the conviction and sentence. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> showed no reaction when <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON> announced the sentence, but family members wept loudly. In the hallway, <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s elderly mother fell writhing to the ground. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s wife sat throughout with her eyes closed, as she had during most of the case's proceedings. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olinsky </PERSON> called the gas the `` most heinous weapon, or close to it, in the history of mankind.'' He noted it was developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, who experimented with it on concentration camp victims. The substance is an odorless, colorless poison that enters the body by inhalation, absorption or injection and causes a painful death. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> described himself as an honest businessman who emigrated to this country in 1972 seeking opportunity. `` I came to the States for better education, more to enjoy freedom and justice and to make money more honestly.''

 The father of a black youth slain in an attack by a white gang was ejected from court after he shouted at a judge who allowed four of the five defendants to remain free on bail. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, father of 16-year-old <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, began yelling at the judge as he and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, stood to leave after Monday's arraignment. `` You handkerchief-headed nigger!'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> yelled at Justice <PERSON> Thaddeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. `` You let murderers walk home free.'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> ordered officers to remove <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who was already on his way out and muttered, `` letting murderers walk home,'' as the family's supporters were escorted from the court. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Patino </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, 18; <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON>, 19; and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, 19, were freed on bail after pleading innocent to murder and other charges in the racial attack that occurred in their <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> neighborhood. About two hours after the pleas, the fifth defendant and alleged triggerman, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>, 18, pleaded innocent and was ordered back to jail without bail. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was shot to death Aug. 23 when he and three friends were surrounded by a gang of about 30 white youths. The black teen-agers had gone to the mostly white <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> neighborhood in response to an advertisement for a used car. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> refused a prosecution request, based on a new indictment, to raise or revoke the $ 75,000 bail for <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patino </PERSON>, as well as a later request from <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>'s attorney to set bail at $ 200,000. <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> DePetris </PERSON>, argued that his client had never before been arrested and denied that <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> was the gunman. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> was identified as the shooter `` by people who have known him all his life.'' <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> told police the day after the killing that he saw <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> shoot the gun, according to a statement released Monday. `` I heard one shot from my left,'' <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> said. `` I looked and I saw <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> pointing a gun and saw him shoot the gun three more times. I saw the blue flash at the black. I then saw the black fall to the ground.'' <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> is out on $ 100,000 bail and <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON> is out on $ 75,000 bail. The prosecutor said he was not legally able to ask for any change in their bail because the charges against them had not changed.

<TEXT>
 In a hit-and-run raid, police rangers flown in by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters and accompanied by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adviser blew up an airstrip used by cocaine smugglers in an eastern jungle. Monday's raid was witnessed by the first reporters allowed onto a new U.S.-built anti-narcotics base in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> since it began operating Sept. 8 beside the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s coca-producing region Anti-drug police in four <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> helicopters flown by <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> contract pilots swooped in on a 1,500-yard dirt airstrip carved into the jungle a hundred yards from the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION>. The rangers quickly set off plastic explosives that left two craters 20 feet in diameter and 12 feet deep in the runway. Within 10 minutes the helicopters were airborne again. `` Speed is the key to safety. We have to come in quickly and get out quickly,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON>, chief of the national anti-drug police force, who led the group. He was referring to the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who dominate the Upper Huallaga valley and provide protection to coca farmers and drug trafficking gangs in return for cash. The four Hueys used in the raid, along with four others on loan to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, are armed with M-60 machine guns and carry gunners at the door on alert for attack from the jungle. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents usually accompany the police rangers on raids but only one was spotted in Monday's attack and reporters were not allowed to talk to him. The burly agent, dressed in jungle fatigues and carrying an assault rifle, looked on as police troopers exploded the charges on the landing strip. He wore a handkerchief over his face to hide his identity while photos were taken. The heavily fortified garrison in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> is the centerpiece of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's increasingly militarized campaign against the drug trade in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, which produces nearly 70 percent of the world's coca leaf, the source of cocaine. The anti-drug base, 150 miles northeast of the capital <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, eventually will contain at least 300 police troopers. They will receive training and air support from up to 50 Americans, including <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents and contracted pilots. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently announced $ 261 million for military and police-action aid to fight cocaine trafficking in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. The three countries this year received $ 57 million. After blowing up the airstrip, the airborne rangers continued on to a cocaine base lab discovered Friday in a bamboo forest near the village of <LOCATION> Ramal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aspuzana </LOCATION> and later dynamited and burned by police. As <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> showed journalists around the dynamited buildings, he pointed out destroyed barrels and dryers that he said turned out 660 pouds of cocaine base a week worth $ 1.2 million. Cocaine base, the final refining stage before pure cocaine, and coca paste, a more elementary stage, are sold to Colombian drug smugglers who arrive at dozens of airstrips scattered through the highland jungle of the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The Colombian cartels turn the paste and base into pure cocaine and smuggle it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. About 200 police rangers have begun operating out of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> base and have destroyed seven laboratories in five days, <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> said. Bulldozers at the base were still working Monday on the airstrip, now 1,800 yards long but designed to reach 2,500 yards _ big enough to handle jumbo C-130 cargo planes. Guard towers 30 feet high provide a view out over the river and the jungle, which has been cut back hundreds of yards from the perimeter of the base. Six-foot-high sandbag barricades protect four helicopter pads. The base, not including the airstrip, covers 100 acres and is closed in by barbed wire. The outlying area is mined. `` The Shining Path is going to lose hundreds of men if it tries to attack this base,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official involved in the war against the cocaine trade.

<TEXT>
 Beach Boy's founder <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> filed a $ 100 million civil suit to recover copyrights to songs that his father sold to A & amp; M Records and an affiliate for $ 700,000 in 1969. The <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> suit Monday charges <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M with fraud and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s former attorneys, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Silberberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Knupp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, with legal malpractice in connection with the sale. It seeks more than $ 50 million in compensatory damages _ the amount <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> alleged A & amp; M earned in publishing royalties from the songs he authored and recorded with the <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> _ and $ 50 million in punitive damages, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was an established writer in 1962 at the age of 19,'' <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. `` A performer who has hit songs does not transfer all publishing rights to his future songs to a publishing company for no consideration.'' The suit covers publishing rights to up to 200 songs recorded by the Beach Boys before 1969, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said, among them `` Surfin' <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' `` Help Me <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON>,'' `` Good Vibrations'' and `` California Girls. A spokeswoman at A & amp; M said Monday the firm and its affiliate would have no comment on the suit. Attorneys at <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silberberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Knupp </PERSON> could not be reached for comment in repeated telephone calls to their offices. The suit contends that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was unable to assert his rights to the songs because of his drug and alcohol abuse and psychological illness, the suit claims. The diagnosis of paranoid psychosis that still affects the singer stemmed from childhood abuse by his father, <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> sold the songs because he was upset over his firing as the band's manager in 1964, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s attorneys, aware of their client's condition, never advised him of his right to assert ownership to the songs, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. In 1962, the year he formed the <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> verbally agreed to allow his father, <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, administrative control of his songs, with <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> retaining 100 percent ownership, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> set up <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tunes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to administer the songs. In 1969, upset over his firing as the band's manager five years earlier, <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> sold his son's publishing rights to the songs to Irving Music for $ 700,000, <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> never saw a penny of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Murry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> died in 1973.

<TEXT>
 Two anti-gun organizations sought grassroots support for stricter gun laws as the death toll from a shooting rampage at a printing plant rose to nine. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Fentress </PERSON>, 45, died Monday afternoon, said a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fentress </PERSON> suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and leg during last Thursday's rampage. The plant worker was one of 13 wounded when <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> sprayed the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gravure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with gunfire from an AK-47 rifle. <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, who then killed himself, had been on permanent disability leave from the plant for the past year because of mental illness. In a full-page ad Monday in The <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Peacemaking and Religion called for the abolition of assault weapons, saying it felt `` compelled to say enough is enough.'' The group said that society shares part of the blame for allowing the assault weapons to be sold legally. `` The blame can no longer be placed solely on the psychologically disturbed individuals who find ways to acquire these deadly weapons and who use them with such abandon,'' the ad said. `` The accomplice to the crime is the legality of their acquisition.'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> McCuen </PERSON>, co-director of the council, said the ad was an exercise in grassroots democracy. `` Most peole are starting to feel like they're under siege. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is starting to look like a war zone.'' Also Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> placed a three-quarters page ad in the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> newspaper featuring <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wife of former presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was injured in the attempted assassination of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981. The ad sought contributions to finance lobbying efforts for `` sensible, effective gun laws.'' `` This is your chance to break the gun lobby's death grip on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said in the ad. `` Together, we can beat the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> ... and keep handguns out of the wrong hands.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportsmen </ORGANIZATION>, said legislation to ban weapons would not prevent similar attacks. `` You ca n't legislate against a nut,'' he said. The gun shop owner in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> who sold <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON> the AK-47 and a MAC-11 pistol said he had decided to quit special ordering the semiautomatic weapons for customers. `` The weapons are so controversial right now that we just do n't want to fool with them any longer,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Tilford </PERSON>'s Gun Sales

<TEXT>
 The national assembly has repealed a 1983 law that allowed courts to order public flogging as part of the sentence for certain crimes, the Mozambican news agency reported today. The law, repealed Monday on a unanimous vote, had allowed judges to impose flogging, in addition to prison sentences, in cases involving security offenses, black marketeering, armed robbery and the rape of minors. International human rights groups had criticized the law and Mozambican authorities reported cases where policemen improperly carried out floggings on their own, without any court proceedings.

 Tropical Storm Iris and its 60 mph winds swirled in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> as Hurricane Hugo devasted the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>' further strengthening was unlikely through this evening, according to hurricane specialist <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. Even so, the governments of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION> issued warnings for <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, the ninth named storm of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, which ends in November. Forecasters warned residents of the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, raked by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, to keep an eye on <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>. At 6 a.m. EDT today, <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>' center was near 18.7 north latitude and 57.9 west longitude, or about 265 miles east of the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. It was moving north-northwest at about 17 mph. The storm was expected to hold that course at a slightly slower pace today. Tropical depressions become named storms when their top sustained winds reach 39 mph. <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> became a storm Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Small metal fatigue cracks found in the rear wing joints of more than a third of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s aging C-141 transport planes have sent the fleet in for inspections and repairs. It is the second time in two years that wing cracks forced the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to restrict flights of its workhorse `` Starlifters,'' which are repaired at <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The cracks were discovered by <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> inspectors last month and led the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> to order checks of its 266 C-141s, some of which are delivering military supplies to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for the push against drug kingpins. All of the C-141s are more than 22 years old. As of Monday, cracks had been discovered on 79 of 204 planes inspected, said Capt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolney </PERSON>, a spokesman for MAC headquarters at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Sixty-four of the planes have been repaired and returned to service <PERSON> Dolney </PERSON> said the restrictions have not affected operations. Military Airlift Command also flies C-5 and C-130 transport planes. The cracks range in length from one-eighth of an inch to 1 -LCB- inches. They have been found on rear wing joints that connect the inner and outer portions of the plane's 159-foot wings. `` Cracks were predicted to occur in this area. However, they were discovered sooner than anticipated,'' said <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkman </PERSON>. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> grounded and inspected its Starlifter fleet because of extensive corrosion and cracks in center wing structures. The plane was originally designed by the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for a lifetime of 30,000 flying hours. Most already have flown more than 29,000 hours.

<TEXT>
 A former nursing home aide charged with smothering five patients often joked about having committed murder, her former lover testified. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> testified Monday in the trial of <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who is charged with five counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder for allegedly suffocating five severely incapacitated patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in Walker. <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON>, also a former nurse's aide at <LOCATION> Alpine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>, testified that she and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> became lovers around the time the alleged slayings began in January 1987. Their relationship continued until December 1988, when <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was arrested, she said. When the 26-year-old <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> first told her she had killed six patients at the nursing home, <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> said she did n't believe it and `` just let it go.'' But <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> then began telling other friends, <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> testified. `` She joked around about it,'' <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> said. `` She'd say, ` I killed six people.''' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> was visibly shaken during <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON>'s testimony, dabbing her eyes with a tissue. <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> admitted smothering the patients with a pillow while her live-in lover, former nurse's aide <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, stood guard outside the door. After <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> moved to <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, in July 1987, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> heard that an autopsy was being conducted on one of the alleged victims, <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> said. `` She wanted to know if it was true and if it was true, she was n't going to take the whole blame for -LRB- the slaying -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> was part of it.'' In other testimony, Ms. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s ex-husband, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, testified that she confessed to him shortly after <PERSON> Baragar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The Woods separated in 1986 and divorced the following year. `` She said, ` You would n't believe some of the things we've done,''' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified `` She said that they had killed six people at Alpine Manor.'' The patients' deaths were ruled natural until <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> told police of his ex-wife's confession in October 1988, about 14 months after their conversation. Ms. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> has pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder. In exchange for her testimony against <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, two counts of first-degree murder were dropped. She has yet to be sentenced. Outside court, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> told reporters he waited before going to police because he had promised his ex-wife he would n't tell anyone. `` I thought about the families of the victims; so many people were going to get hurt,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` But <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> was n't getting any better. I sensed a lot of guilt. She could n't let go of what had happened. ... I went to police because she needed help.'' The prosecution was expected to rest today, after which <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is expected to testify in her own behalf. If convicted, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> faces a mandatory life prison term without parole.

<HEAD>Roof Collapse Injures Kids at YMCA Pool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A section of roof over a <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> swimming pool collapsed on a preschool swimming class while horrified parents watched, and seven children and a lifeguard were injured. Authorities said they did n't know what caused chunks of concrete, tar and roofing stone to cascade into the pool Monday. `` We were looking through a picture window down the other end, and then the whole roof over the shallow end just came down in one piece,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, was not injured in the accident. The collapse left a jagged 20-by-15 foot hole in the roof of the brick building. Lifeguard <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bortolotto </PERSON>, 18, who was hit in the head by a piece of debris, and <PERSON> Ellenmarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, the aquatic programs director, rushed to rescue the children, aged 3 to 6, from the pool. Police Superintendent <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> McHale </PERSON> called Bortolotto `` a real superstar. He collapsed after he got the kids out.'' Bortolotto and swimming student <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Blasenheim </PERSON>, 4, were the most seriously injured. Bortolotto was in stable condition and <PERSON> Blasenheim </PERSON> was in serious condition with a depressed skull fracture and abdominal injuries. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roxbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> treasurer, said moisture and humidity in the pool area may have weakened the concrete roof decking and possibly led to the collapse. He said the roof was inspected in 1984 and 1987. Another section of the building was inspected this summer after rainwater was found to be leaking from the ceiling into an office.

<HEAD>Former Indian Prime Minister Denies He Was CIA Informant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge said Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> does not have to reveal his sources for now for a book that said former Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Moraji </PERSON> <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> was a paid <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> informant. The jury Monday watched a videotape of <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, who has sued <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> for libel, in which he denied knowing any <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents. The deposition was taped during visits by <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1984 and 1985. <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, 94, was too ill to travel from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to testify, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Cyriac </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappil </PERSON>. <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> filed a lawsuit almost six years ago seeking $ 100 million in damages against <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, claiming that he was libeled in the journalist's 1983 book, `` The Price of Power,'' about former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. In one of the book's chapters, <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> had served as a paid informant for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit was filed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in accordance with the tradition of filing defamation actions in the hometown of the defendant. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but now lives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> was expected to be called to testify later this week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Norgle </PERSON> denied a motion by <PERSON> Kappil </PERSON> to force <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> to reveal the unnamed sources he cited in the book. But he said there may come a time in the trial when it might be necessary to disclose the names of the sources. In his opening statement, <PERSON> Kappil </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>'s book implied that <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> was `` a traitor to his government'' and contained false statements. `` He wrote a book to sell,'' <PERSON> Kappil </PERSON> said. `` As is sometimes the case, to sell a book, they like to put a little curry ... a little flavor'' in it. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, said the author had six independent sources who claimed <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, a bitter enemy of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, received $ 20,000 a year as a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> informant. The lawyer said the Indian politician cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> because he was opposed to Ms. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s close relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and her preparations for the 1971 war with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` He tended to oppose whatever she wanted,'' <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said. `` Here were two bare-knuckled Indian politicians who make <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> look like a rose garden.'' <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> served as prime minister from 1977-80 after his <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> coalition swept Ms. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from power. In <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> libel cases involving a public figure, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant knew that what he was printing was false, negligent or malicious. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970 for his articles exposing the My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> massacre in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, when he was a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 The city held its first district-only primary elections today after officials approved a settlement in a voters' rights lawsuit The city council decision Monday evening ended a year-long legal battle and negotiations with lawyers representing black and Hispanic voters in the federal class-action suit. `` At last we've resolved it,'' Mayor <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` I think it is a fair compromise, and I am pleased the election will proceed. I hope everybody goes out and votes.'' Voters approved district-only elections last year. Today's primary in four of the city's eight council districts is the first election since then The lawsuit contended the voting power of minorities in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> was diluted unconstitutionally by a city-wide council election system. Terms of the settlement require June 1990 ballot initiatives on redistricting the city and on increasing the size of council from eight to 10 seats. `` This increases the opportunity for minorities to elect who they want to elect, and it increases the opportunity for minorities to get elected,'' said <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Haro </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which filed the lawsuit.

<HEAD>Japan To Reduce South Pacific Driftnet Fleet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has notified countries in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> that it will cut driftnet fishing fleets to one-third of last year's record level in the tuna-rich area, officials said today Fifteen countries in the South Pacific Forum demanded in July that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> entirely ban fishing with the enormous nets, calling it `` indiscriminate, irresponsible and destructive.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said then it would continue to permit driftnet fishing for two years while researching its effect on fish stocks, which fisheries experts in the region said could be depleted within two years. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has not responded to the demands to end driftnet fishing in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Today, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fishery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> notified <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> countries including <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is to reduce the number of driftnet vessels in the season starting in November to a maximum of 20 per year, the level before the number shot up to about 60 driftnetters. Fishing with driftnets, which are also called gillnets, is strongly disputed in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> as well. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has negotiated with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to limit and monitor use of the long nets which environmentalists call `` walls of death'' because they snare all kinds of marine life. Driftnet fishing uses nets up to 50 miles long. It has been condemned as strip mining of the seas and blamed for the destruction of sea mammals, birds and fish other than the target, southern albacore tuna. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complained that driftnet fishing in unauthorized <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> waters was hurting salmon runs in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. During the 1988-89 fishing year, the 60 Japanese driftnet vessels in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> caught some 10,000 tons of tuna, said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. In comparison, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> caught just 200 to 400 tons by pole-and-line fishing, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> 5,200 tons by trawling, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fetched 3,700 tons, the official added. <PERSON> Kentaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Iwasa </PERSON>, spokesman for an association of pole-and-line tuna fishers, said the government's decision should be a step toward eliminating driftnet fishing. `` Some of our fishing boats got into trouble when the boat's propeller got caught in a driftnet where driftnet fishing was prohibited,'' he said, `` We've been urging driftnet fishers and the government that hazardous driftnet fishing should be eliminated. Foreign Ministry Spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> told reporters that each driftnet vessel will have to report its catch. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will send a patrol vessel to police Japanese driftnetters and a research vessel to the Tasman Sea, between <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, for biological research, he said. One representative from the region can participate in the research team as an observer.

<TEXT>
 Retiring Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> is urging that the new national AIDS commission try to turn around the `` mean-spiritedness'' some Americans show towards people with AIDS. And the outspoken physician suggests that those who act hatefully toward victims of the incurable disease should be treated in the same way by society. `` You could isolate the mean-spirited people in this country and if the rest of society could treat them with the same repugnance that those people treat persons with AIDS, I think that should be your goal,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told the commission Monday. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who has sought to heighten awareness about AIDS during his tenure as the nation's top health adviser, also said the government must find a better way to reach teen-agers who are ignoring AIDS warnings. `` We know that sexual activity is rampant and that people of the group I'm talking about are not listening to us,'' he said. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deficiency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndrome </ORGANIZATION> as it held its first day of testimony from experts, including researchers, advocates and AIDS patients. The panel was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year to advise the president and <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on AIDS issues. The latest figures from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> there are 105,990 Americans diagnosed as having AIDS. Of those, 60 percent are homosexual or bisexual males and 20 percent are intravenous drug users. <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> caused an uproar with his October 1986 report on AIDS in which he advocated sex education for young children. `` I still believe in that very firmly,'' he told the commission. Parents, he said, `` should be joining with and not fighting the schools in getting this done and getting it done properly.'' `` I do believe if we taught sexuality in kind, loving, compassionate, caring ways in a family context that we could raise a generation of teen-agers to be less sexually active than the ones we have today,'' he said. The panel, which met for the first time last month, will take up the work of an earlier AIDS commission formed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and chaired by Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. That panel called for a major escalation of federal efforts to treat, cure and prevent AIDS and for legislation to protect victims from discrimination. Commission member <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a 30-year-old mother of two who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion, said the panel can make a difference in the lives of people with AIDS. `` We all want nothing more and nothing less than what all of you take for granted today: a place to live, the right to have a job, decent medical care and to lead their lives without invisible barriers,'' she said. She said she would like to see the commission work for federal protections against discrimination for people with AIDS and for policies that get expensive drug treatments to those who need them. `` Compassion is n't going to happen because of a report we make or an edict that somebody in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> delivers,'' she said. `` It'll begin in the small towns and quiet country throughout <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where people who live with AIDS and HIV infection are just like us, because they are us.

 Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> says he wo n't be drawn into controversy about an obscene gesture he made to hecklers, but a member of his committee to improve the capital city's image says `` it does n't bode well.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who says he will run for a fourth term in 1990 despite reported allegations by former associates that he has used drugs, was greeted Sunday with boos and obscene hand gestures from some members of a crowd at an outdoor festival. Smiling, the mayor made an obscene finger gesture. The incident was captured on videotape by a local television station. `` I will not be sidetracked or drawn into responding to insignificant, single incidents that do not affect me or the job the voters of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, elected me to do,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said Monday in a written statement. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a local public relations executive and member of the mayor's committee to improve the city's image, said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s reaction would be normal for many people, but not for a mayor `` I guess we hope that that -LRB- television footage -RRB- does n't make it nationally. It does n't bode well,'' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. One mayoral candidate, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, called on <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> not to seek re-election, saying the incident shows he is `` essentially politically impotent.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, whose links to a convicted drug dealer are under federal investigation, has repeatedly denied ever using drugs. Officials said about 275,000 people attended the outdoor festival.

 A landlord whose rooming house was gutted in a fire that killed eight tenants has been convicted of criminally negligent homicide for code violations that included a door locked with a key from the inside. Two tenants were found dead at the door in the Jan. 15 blaze in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Colabella </PERSON> on Monday convicted <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> on two counts of criminally negligent homicide and acquitted the 67-year-old landlord on five others. An eighth count was dismissed earlier. It was believed to be the first time in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that a landlord was held liable for a death because of failure to comply with safety codes. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> could receive one and one-third to four years in prison on each count at sentencing Nov. 2. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, had been charged with the eight deaths because of fire code violations that included a missing fire door and a dead bolt on the front door that required a key from the inside to unlock. He was convicted in the deaths of the two men, ages 52 and 61, who were found at the locked door of the four-story building. Investigators said the fire started in the basement and was caused by careless smoking by a drunken resident. The resident died in the blaze. Defense attorney <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Comer </PERSON> said the lack of case law on landlord liability made an appeal `` absolutely necessary.'' <PERSON> Comer </PERSON> had argued that the special lock had been requested by tenants worried about the drug addicts hanging out on the steps. He had also noted that several tenants had been drunk and said that contributed to their inability to get out. District Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergari </PERSON>'s office seized records of city agencies to determine why full inspections had not been done in as much as a decade.

<HEAD>Judge Says Federal Feather Permit Process Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The permit process imposed on Pueblo Indians seeking eagle feathers for religious rites is unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled. The process `` constitutes excessive entanglement with the religious tenets of those tribes and is therefore an invalid mixture of church and state,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> ruled Friday. Eagle feathers are available to Pueblos only by applying to a depository maintained by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>'s ruling came in the case of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON>, a Pueblo charged in the purchase of a golden eagle for $ 500 that he resold to a cousin. The case stems from a Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> sting that netted hundreds of arrests in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in January. `` The most significant thing to me in the opinion is that this court has recognized that Indian religious practices are entitled to just as much protection as anybody else's religion,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said he is unsure whether he will appeal. But he said, `` There's no question that the transfer of the eagle was for money, and we do n't think Indian religious freedom was an issue.'' <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON> says he sold the eagle at no profit to his cousin, who needed it after he was to be initiated into a pueblo religious society. The cousin tried for two years to get an eagle through the federal depository, the defense argued. The prosecution contended that <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON> bought the eagle to make a fetish for a non-Indian psychiatrist for several thousand dollars. But the judge ruled that the prosecution failed to establish any motive other than religious convictions. The judge also noted that Pueblos whose applications are granted get frozen eagles that often are killed by non-Indians in an unspecified manner. Some Indian rituals forbid use of a dead eagle; others designate how the eagle should be killed, he said. <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, a Pueblo anthropologist, testified at a hearing that <PERSON> Pueblo </PERSON> religion would `` wither away'' without eagle feathers but that the plumes are available only through a cumbersome and intrusive process. `` The federal depository has a special problem because one may apply, but one never knows when or even if you'll get the feathers you need,'' he said. `` It's very sad that <PERSON> Pueblo </PERSON> peoples who still practice their traditional religion have to rely on such a system.''

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of students staged anti-U.S. protests in the capital and in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> today as Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived for talks expected to cover human rights and democratic reform. A clash also was reported near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> between police and leftist students protesting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s planned visit to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Police fired pistols in the air to scatter the students, who then withdrew to a nearby park. No arrests were report. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, hundreds of riot police lined the route taken by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s heavily-guarded motorcade as he went from a military airport outside to Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON>'s office at the start of two days of talks. Radical students opposing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit staged a small protest at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Municipal <ORGANIZATION> Polytech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where about 100 students burned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and chanted `` We oppose <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit to the death.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Kyunghee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, 50 students burned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and an effigy of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. They also shouted slogans against newly assigned <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, describing him as a `` <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> master of political manipulation.'' Protests were reported at two other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses, but there was no confrontation with police. About 500 radical students shouting `` Yankee go home!'' battled riot police with firebombs and rocks in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, police said. The protests were minuscule by South Korean standards and dissident groups made no effort to organize demonstrations in protest of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit. The radicals are demanding an end to close ties with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and expulsion of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense pact. South Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops must remain to ensure <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> does not attack the south. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> intervened on behalf of the south during the 1950-53 Korean War and has kept troops in the country ever since. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> were greeted by the prime minister and top <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers on their arrival from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Two Korean children presented the Quayles with flowers and the vice president inspected an honor guard. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is to meet President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> and heads of the main political parties on Wednesday. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is expected to urge the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government to keep its commitment to bringing in full democratic rule since <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> took power in February last year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is unhappy about a recent wave of arrests of opponents of the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government. South Korean opposition leaders were to tell <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> about their concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation, opposition party officials said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> report released Sunday said 2,094 people had been detained on political charges since <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> came to power in February 1988. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who would not be named, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would urge the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government to show greater respect for human rights in view of the jailings and other government moves to curb opposition. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general, has helped introduce broad democratic reforms, but conservative groups within the government are taking a tougher line. Opposition groups contend the government is backing off its promise of full democracy.

 A short-order cook was charged with murder after police found boiled and peeled parts of his girlfriend's body in a bus terminal storage compartment. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON>, 28, was arrested Monday. The victim, a 26-year-old dancer, was not immediately identified. Deputy Chief <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenrich </PERSON> said the victim's skull and some bones were discovered Monday.

Police said they were investigating the possibility of cannibalism. The victim, believed to have been a native of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, broke off her relationship with <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON>, police said.

 With Hurricane Hugo heading toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland, cruise lines emptied their ships of passengers and `` hauled tail'' out of port. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> residents jammed the phone lines of insurance companies for financial protection. The eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>'s strongest storm in 10 years churned toward the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> today after scouring <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> with 125 mph winds, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless. Early computer predictions indicated the storm was likely to hit the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> late in the week, and officials told coastal residents to familiarize themselves with emergency procedures. `` Hurricane Hugo has the potential of being the worst storm to affect the Southeast coast since <PERSON> David </PERSON> hit the <LOCATION> Georgia-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast in 1979,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Purvis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Climate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> Workers at the Kennedy Space Center at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, began preparing to roll the space shuttle Atlantis from its launch pad into a building in case <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> comes too close. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> decided to drain the fuel from an Atlas-Centaur rocket carrying a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> satellite, postponing the launch from Friday to at least Sunday. Preparations were being made to remove the satellite, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said today that no decision on moving it or the shuttle would be made until Wednesday. Cruise lines in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, quickly unloaded passengers, changed itineraries and sent passengerless liners out to sea after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s winds began to rake the island Sunday morning. `` We hauled tail and got out of there,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Steck </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, which canceled this week's trip on the <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Viking </LOCATION> and ended last week's tour a day early, bringing 444 passengers into <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> on Saturday. `` As soon as the people were off, we took out to sea with just crew on board,'' <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Ships are built to ride in rough water. Its natural element is the sea. We'll just go as far as we can get from it and then turn around and face it.'' Royal Caribbean offered passengers on the canceled trip free tickets and $ 200 spending money on a later cruise, <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> said. Carnival Cruise Lines diverted the Celebration, which which normally carries up to 1,800 passengers on weeklong trips through <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> and the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, toward <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Carnival was watching <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s development closely before deciding whether to divert the Carnivale, which left <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Monday with about 1,000 passengers on a four-day trip to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. Days before possible hurricane watches or warnings for the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area, some insurance agents already have issued a warning of their own: It's now too late to get flood insurance protection for Hugo. `` If someone comes in and wants to add flood insurance, there's a five-day waiting period,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Berhardt </PERSON>, a State Farm agent. Agents for other companies said the hurricane was fast approaching the point beyond which they would issue no more increases in property insurance. Independent agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Handeman </PERSON> of south <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said once any hurricane crosses 15 degrees north latitude and 72 degrees west latitude, he wo n't sell homeowners increased coverage. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is at about 80 degrees west longitude. Early today, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s center already had passed the threshold. At 2 a.m. EDT, its center was near 20.7 degrees north latitude and 67.3 degrees west longitude, moving north northwest at 12 mph. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials were hoping <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> would give them enough warning before bringing high winds to the launch site at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s contingency plan, officials will order a rollback of the Atlantis if they receive a forecast that hurricane-force winds will arrive at the cape within 72 hours. By Monday night, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimated there was only an 8 percent chance that hurricane force winds would hit <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> before Thursday evening. But because the shuttle can move at only 1 mph, the journey back to the assembly building takes six hours, leaving little room for error. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said that if caught by high winds it could secure the shuttle and its cargo, the nuclear-powered <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> space probe, on the launch pad to ride out any storm. A return to the hangar would certainly mean a delay in the scheduled Oct. 12 launch of Atlantis, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has until late November to send the probe on its six-year voyage to the planet Jupiter.

 Nearly 100 miners occupied a <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> control room for a third day today despite a $ 13.5 million fine and a court order. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlothlin </PERSON> imposed the fine against the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> on Monday for a variety of violations in July and August during the strike begun against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> in April. He also barred union members and supporters from impeding <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> operations. But on the other side of Copper Ridge, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members continued to occupy the control room, where they barricaded themselves Sunday with padlocks and steel cables. State Police made no immediate attempt to remove the demonstrators _ 98 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members and a religious leader who carried sleeping bags, toilet articles and enough food for about 10 days. Union leaders said the takeover would remain peaceful and promised that no damage would be done to the plant, where coal is sorted, cleaned and shipped. About 1,200 supporters rallied outside Monday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> said. `` Until something develops, we're just observing and hoping nothing gets out of hand,'' <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,695 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> employees from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> are involved in the strike, which has become a cause for organized labor across the country because the workers believe <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is trying to break the union. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> now has been fined roughly $ 22 million by state and federal judges for illegal demonstrations and acts of violence against company property and employees. Late Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> filed court papers to have the sit-in declared unlawful. A court official said the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> is seeking heavy fines, jail terms and an end to the $ 200 weekly strike benefits to members. A hearing was set for this afternoon in Big Stone Gap. The demonstration was designed to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> to come to the bargaining table and as a statement against unfair labor laws, union officials said Negotiations have been stalled for six weeks and no talks are scheduled.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, accusing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of interfering in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> by sending arms to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, says he's not ready to set a date for a summit meeting with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I feel under no rush on that subject,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters Monday at a news conference in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, before flying here for the night. The president, on a two-day tour of western states celebrating their 100th anniversary, also said he was not about to be pressured on the issue of arms control by reports of a new Soviet proposal. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is expected to meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House on Thursday, before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s meeting beginning the following day in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded he had heard, but could not personally confirm, speculation that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> would bring with him a new proposal for limiting long-range nuclear missiles. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We're not going to just react to his proposals. We're going to be very interested and welcome them, but we just simply can not and will not keep reacting.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied he was dragging his feet on entering negotiations with the Soviets on limiting ballistic missiles, although he conceded this might be the perception because had focused attention earlier in his administration `` into getting conventional force stability'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Asked about a summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he first wanted to await results of the <LOCATION> Baker-Shevardnadze </LOCATION> meeting. A superpower summit is expected to be one issue on the agenda. Suggesting that Soviet intentions still leave a lot to be desired, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We have interests in this hemisphere where the Soviets are continuing to send ... increased amounts of arms going into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> right now over last year. That's not very good. That's not a very kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Monday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has reacted timidly to events in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and should actively support the forces of democratic change in the communist world. He called on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to support the entry of communist nations into Western economic institutions, `` once their internal reforms merit such participation.'' `` Now is the time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to encourage and capitalize upon the changes we have sought for so long,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> speech. `` The administration's timidity in the face of these opportunities is puzzling and dismaying. Instead of encouragement and engagment, the administration has adopted an almost passive stance.'' On another issue involving <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not fear for his safety or for that of his family because of reported death threats from Colombian drug lords, saying he had confidence in the Secret Service. He said there was `` no hard intelligence evidence'' of the targeting of his family or of any other Americans by drug interests in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` But, clearly, any such action would, I think, just bring down the total wrath of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and the American government,'' he said. On another topic, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was not ready to restore normal relations with the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, saying there has been little apparent change in that government's attitudes since Chinese troops fired on unarmed demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square last spring. `` It's not a time for total normalcy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. His administration announced on Monday it intends to give most-favored-nation trade status to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s communist government at his news conference for allowing thousands of East Germans to flock across its borders en route to freedom in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Asked whether he favors the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I would think it's a matter for the Germans to decide.'' But, he added: `` If that -LRB- reunification -RRB- was worked out between the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western interests.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, returning to Soviet issues, said he was not ready to relax trade restrictions on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> like he is doing for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. He said that, despite some reported progress, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still is not permitting free emigration of Soviet Jews and other minorities. `` I think things are improving, but I think as long as someone is held in a country against their will because they ca n't get out, it is a matter of human concern,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 Two fishing boats with 37 people aboard collided in the dark early today and one vessel sank in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Two crewmen were reported injured.

A Coast Guard cutter, a helicopter and two patrol boats remained on the scene during the rescue effort, <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said. The cause of the accident was under investigation. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said the weather apparently was not a factor because skies were partly cloudy with calm seas and winds.

 Employers in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> will soon be required to post warnings about the perils of drug use. The Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted an ordinance Monday night requiring such notices. It will take effect next week after a procedural second reading. The warnings will be displayed in offices, businesses and other workplaces. They will contain information such as `` even one line of cocaine has been known to kill the user'' and `` marijuana can cause serious psychotic problems.'' The ordinance contains no enforcement mechanism or penalties for noncompliance. The legislation is similar to state laws that require warnings about alcohol at places where liquor is sold. The postings will also include a list of drug treatment centers.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> today laughed about foreign reports of his death and spoke of how his reappearance in public had helped the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> stock exchange. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 85, also told Japanese lawmaker <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> that among the politicians he most respected were former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>. All three men led the way in improving their countries' relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The meeting at the Great Hall of the People was the second for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reclusive leader in three days. On Saturday, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> appeared in public for the first time in three months when he held talks with Chinese-American physicist T.D. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s re-emergence after the long absence has, for the moment, dispelled speculation that he is gravely ill with cancer and may not have long to live. The nationally televised evening news showed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> walking unaided to meet <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, whom he called `` an old friend'' as the two shook hands. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Parliamentarians League for Japan-China Friendship, opened the meeting by commenting that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> appeared to be in the same good health as when they met a year ago, despite reports that he was seriously ill. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> replied that the foreign mass media had already declared him dead or very sick Such reports caused the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> stock market to fall, he said, adding that the market had recovered when he reappeared Saturday with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. `` In reality I have always been healthy,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, a Japanese lawmaker and member of the delegation, provided details of the meeting to the Japanese press. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> praised the `` high political consciousness'' of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, who helped bring about the normalization of relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> even though <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was then in the throes of the leftist Cultural Revolution. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION>, made a secret trip to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1971 to set the stage for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s dramatic visit in February 1972. <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was later to be forced out of office by scandal, traveled to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in September 1972 to normalize relations between the two countries. Drawing an apparent comparison with the leaders of the West today, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> criticized the participants of the recent seven-nation summit of industrialized nations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for calling on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to cease its crackdown on those who sought democratic reforms. He also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s attitude has been different from that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been vocal in calling for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to end its suppression of dissent and ensure the human rights of its citizens. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has curtailed high-level official contacts and suspended talks on new loans since the army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians June 3-4 in clearing central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> of pro-democracy protesters. But <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has also muffled its public criticisms of the Chinese government's actions. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> stressed the importance of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s relations with its biggest trading partner outside <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, and said ties should continue despite <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s recent domestic turmoil. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, the highest-level Japanese official to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since June, said the June events had put a damper on relations between the two countries and his mission was to find out how these problems could be overcome. Since arriving Sunday, <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> has also met with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> and other top leaders. He was to return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> later today. On Saturday, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said the crushed pro-democracy movement `` has taught us a major lesson ... After the turmoil, all of us have become sober-minded.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> stressed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s commitment to the market-oriented reforms he initiated 10 years ago, but added that some officials `` did not pay enough attention to ideological and political developments.'' It was an apparent reference to ousted party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who has been accused of encouraging `` bourgeois liberalization,'' or acceptance of Western liberal ideas, in pushing ahead with rapid reform without duly considering ideological matters.

 Forecasters today said deadly Hurricane Hugo could hit anywhere from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> this weekend _ or spin harmlessly away in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` It's a long way from any potential landfall,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. `` Unfortunately, the higher likelihood is that it will turn more west and could make landfall anywhere from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' Sheets added, though, that it's also possible the hurricane could skirt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> entirely. Forecasters today watched data spit out of computers, studied satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> `` hurricane hunter'' planes, and even pulled out old hurricane charts to see what storms similar to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> have done. The data laid out conflicting futures for <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, Sheets said. `` We were just looking through a bunch of the old charts,'' he said. `` They've done everything. They've done loopity-loops, they've gone into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, they've gone into central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, all the way up to the Carolinas. The main area of agreement on the computer models, Sheets said, was that <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> is likely to change from the north-northwest course it followed overnight after pounding <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` Now the question is when is it going to turn more west-northwest,'' Sheets said. `` There's just not any way to say.'' Hurricanes are propelled by prevailing winds generated by other weather systems. The most likely impact on <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> will be a `` Bermuda High,'' a high-pressure system building to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s northeast, forecasters said. That system would tend to keep <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> from veering from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>.

 Prosecutors dropped rape charges after a woman announced in court she plans to marry the man she accused of attacking her. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, 25, in June testified she was `` pinned down'' and raped by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, 31. But on Monday, she said she plans to marry him Sept. 30.

It's the first time I've ever had a victim pay my fee.'' While rape and related offenses were withdrawn, Farmer did plead guilty to stealing a diamond ring from Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> and received two years' probation. <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said the woman met Farmer at a tattoo parlor and set up a dinner date. When Farmer arrived at her apartment, her friend gave him a prescription drug, which she blames for his aggressive behavior, <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said. `` He's now undergoing drug rehabilitation,'' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said.

 Pilots of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 disagreed over how best to control their crippled airliner seconds before it crash-landed at an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> airport, according to a transcript of cockpit conversation. The transcript shows Capt. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 called for left turns, right turns and a cut in power within the final 20 seconds before the DC-10 cartwheeled and exploded in flames at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on July 19, killing 112 people. But trainer pilot <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> told <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> that closing the throttles would take away the ability to steer the plane, according to the transcript released Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. A report accompanying the transcript said <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> believes he added power `` just prior to contact with the ground.'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> and two other pilots in the cockpit have been widely praised for bringing the jetliner down with no greater loss of life after one of its three engines exploded, severing all hydraulic flight controls. The cockpit crew and 180 people survived the crash. The transcript shows that just 15 seconds before impact, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> and First Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Records </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> to `` close off'' both throttles. But <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, who had been called into the cockpit from the passenger section to assist the airliner's three-man crew, replied, `` Nah, I ca n't pull'em off or we'll lose it. That's what's turnin' ya. <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> had been steering the plane by selectively applying power to its two wing engines after its tail-mounted third engine apparently threw out parts that severed hydraulic lines in its tail. The DC-10's builder, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, last week announced changes in the design of its planes' hydraulic systems that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said would ensure similar hydraulic failure would not occur again. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, inspector for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> assisting in the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigation, said the plane's remaining two engines were operating when it hit. He said there were no apparent conflicts in statements flight crew members made to investigators about the landing, but acknowledged there was disagreement in the flight's final seconds over cutting back power. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>' order to `` close off'' the throttles was to put the engines in idle, not to shut them down completely, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. The cockpit tape, on a loop that records over itself after about a half-hour, covers only the final 33 minutes and 34 seconds of the flight. The tape does not include the sound of the engine failure on the Denver-Chicago flight or pilot conversation over the next 10 minutes. The safety board last month released transcripts of the plane's communication with the ground, but had not previously included sounds picked up by the cockpit microphone `` Ease the power back,'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> told <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> a few seconds before impact. `` Maybe you can pull'em all the way off,'' suggested First Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Records </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> then called for left turns and said, `` Close the throttles.'' After a few seconds, he called for a right turn and again said, `` Close the throttles.'' But <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON> declined. The board provided no analysis of the taped conversation, which will be used in its continuing investigation into the crash. A report accompanying the transcript noted there was constant discussion among crew members on the best course of action to take during the flight. The transcript shows they discussed whether to lower the landing gear, and later disagreed about when the wheel door was opened. At one point the captain said, `` Anybody got any idea about puttin' the gear down right now?'' Another crew member, identified tentatively as <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, later said, `` Dammit. I wish we had n't put that gear down.'' About four minutes before the crash landing, <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> gave rapid `` back'' and `` forward'' commands and then said, `` Wo n't this be a fun landing?''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today its criminal division is reviewing records of the long-running congressional investigation into influence peddling at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. `` The records of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee are being reviewed closely as a part of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> matter,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, the department's chief spokesman. He said the review began earlier this summer and is being conducted by the fraud and public integrity sections of the criminal division. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> rejected calls from several lawmakers that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> seek court appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. `` Investigations are proceeding in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices around the country and there is no reason to believe these can not be handled by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` has made it clear he wants these cases given high priority,'' the spokesman added. The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing has heard allegations of influence peddling during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to obtain high-level approval of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> financing for development projects. The panel has also heard conflicting testimony about the role of former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the awarding of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants to politically connected developers. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has denied allegations that he helped political friends get <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants. The panel has heard testimony contradicting <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s denials and has called him back for more questioning on the matter The public integrity section earlier had reviewed a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's report that found broad instances of lobbying of top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials by developers. The prosecutors made a preliminary conclusion that the report had uncovered no instances of wrongdoing. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, meanwhile, asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Monday to reverse a court decision they say could cost the government more than the $ 2 billion pricetag put on past agency abuses. The request came at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing at which deputies to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> also promised to permanently flush politics out of the selection process for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s abuse-riddled Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program. It was the first HUD-related hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returned earlier this month from a month-long recess. Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the panel planned to call all of the major players in the Reagan-era abuses at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, an indication the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would seek to match an exhaustive investigation being conducted by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee During prior testimony, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> agreed with a congressman's $ 2 billion `` ballpark'' estimate of the cost to taxpayers of the influnce-peddling, fraud and mismanagement in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs during the eight-year tenure of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON>, the agency's general assistance secretary for multifamily housing, said a recent decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Ninth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> could cost <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> $ 2.5 billion over the next decade unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> amends housing laws. The court rejected <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s formula for granting rent increases to Section 8 projects, saying the agency can not use rent-comparability studies to determine how much owners of subsidized apartments can raise rents. <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> said the ruling would cost <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> $ 150 million in the circuit court's nine-state jurisdiction and if applied nationwide could cost from $ 600 million to $ 1 billion in retroactive rent adjustments and another $ 1.5 billion over the next 10 years. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said the panel would consider the request and asked <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> to provide more information on the ruling The moderate rehabilitation program was the subject of a scathing report earlier this year in which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general said that lucrative subsidies were awarded to former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials or other developers who retained prominent Republican consultants. Much of the influence peddling was blamed on a 1984 decision to repeal a `` fair share'' formula through which the subsidies were awarded to local housing authorities that demonstrated a need for the low-income housing and the ability to administer the program. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials took over most of the funding decisions after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> repealed the formula. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, however, voluntarily decided to revert to using the `` fair share'' approach and his deputies said the department would continue that if the program is funded next year. The inspector general also found that many moderate rehabilitation projects were approved at excessive rents, costing the government hundreds of millions of dollars over the 15-year subsidy contracts. <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> said about 300 of the projects will be audited in the beginning of the new fiscal year which begins Oct. 1 and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> would move to lower the rent subsidies if they were inappropriately calculated.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> met today to discuss <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, and the government's two main parties appeared locked in a dispute over <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s plan to sponsor Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> left <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office without speaking to reporters after an hour-long meeting. He spent seven hours in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> refused to divulge details of the meeting, but repeated <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s remark Monday that he could not maintain his governing coalition between his rightist <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` at any price.'' Israeli newspapers reported that Labor leaders were negotiating secretly with smaller religious parties to try to form a governing coalition if the current coalition falls. The controversy centers on <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s opposition to <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal for breaking a stalemate in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is also concerned about <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s remarks at a <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> news conference hinting at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> recognition of an indirect <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> role in peace talks, Israeli radio stations reported. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially refuses to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terror group. In those remarks, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agreed to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> arranging an Israeli-Palestinian meeting. He said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> could put together the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation `` after coordinating with various elements... including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Palestinian leaders interpreted <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s remarks as consenting to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s suggestion that the delegation include Arabs deported by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the occupied territories. That would be a compromise between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> wants to include only Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> wants Palestinians from outside. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not respond directly today to <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s remarks, except to hint that his fractious governing coalition, put together last December, was in trouble. `` I personally would like to see the coalition remain, but I must say that unity is not worth any price,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also is under heavy pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> hard-liners who oppose <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s plan because it urges <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept the principle of trading territory for peace. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> tried to play down the crisis today. `` We have coalition crises here an average of about once a month, so we need another crisis today,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. Two peace plans were discussed at the <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> meeting, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said in separate news conferences Monday. According to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan, approved by the government in May, 1.7 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would elect delegates to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on an interim autonomy solution, with the final status of the territories to be decided later. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s plan is more specific. It calls for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to trade land for peace and requires that the building of Jewish settlements be halted in the occupied lands, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Labor supports <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s 10-point memorandum as way of breaking the impasse in the peace process, and it is inclined to agree to talk with the deportees or with compromise candidates such as one defined by <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as `` a -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- professor from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said he will conduct the next round of peace talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he is to meet with Labor leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> and also with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. The Israeli Cabinet will discuss the Egyptian initiative in two to three weeks, when both ministers return to the country, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Man Who Allegedly Staged Own Death Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, tipped off by TV viewers, sent a blank sheet of paper by certified mail to catch a man suspected of staging his death in a 1982 boat explosion to collect more than $ 500,000 in life insurance. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> `` Buck'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 34, featured last month on the program `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' was arrested Monday. Postal workers in <LOCATION> Dania </LOCATION> had reported to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> resembled a man named <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> who leased a postal box there. On Monday, postal workers notified <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> that he had received an envelope via certified mail. The envelope was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> ploy. Although postal workers attempted to stall him, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> left before the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> arrived. But sheriff's deputies spotted his van and arrested him. Inside the van, deputies found an automatic weapon, a silencer, $ 40,000 in cash, a $ 40,000 cashier's check and marijuana, said sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and his father are accused of trying to collect insurance from his `` death'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which until May was thought to have been real. The mystery began when <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' boat exploded on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, one day before <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was to stand trial on burglary charges. Rescue workers found no body and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was declared dead after the accident. In May, however, an informant told investigators that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was living in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> under the alias <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, is in custody and is scheduled to stand trial later this month.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said today that a Roman Catholic convent of Carmelite nuns near the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> should be moved to another site, as Jewish groups have sought. Breaking its silence on an issue that has severely strained Jewish-Catholic relations, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said it would help to pay for a prayer center in which the nuns would live. Jewish leaders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> applauded the statement and said it would improve Jewish-Catholic relations. A February 1987 accord between Jewish and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> representatives stipulated that the nuns would be moved to the prayer center from a convent just outside <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. Jews have objected to their presence at a site where 2.5 million Jews were murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. However, the Polish primate, Cardinal <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, has called for renegotiating the agreement and said the Polish church did not have the money to build a new home for the nuns. The agreement, signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, called for the nuns to have been moved by Feb. 22, but the deadline passed and the nuns remained. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, on a 24-hour visit to <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, to consecrate a Polish Catholic church, indicated he had not read the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> statement. Based on what reporters had told him about the statement, he said: `` this would seem to be a forceful resolution of the problem and I do n't think that would be a very positive way of resolving it.'' But <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> also said `` there is a possibility that the nuns could move elsewhere.'' `` But if they were to be moved, this should be done with charity because even if we were to transfer these nuns to a different location, that would also be crossing out their rights,'' he said. The archbishop of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON>, said last month that the church was abrogating the agreement since it could not be fulfilled in an atmosphere of aggressive demands. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Commission for Religious Relations with <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> said in a communique today that it was pleased with a declaration from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s bishops earlier this month that Roman Catholics and Jewish groups should resume talks on building a prayer center in which the nuns would live. `` The Holy See is convinced that such a center would contribute in an important way to development of good relations between Christians and Jews,'' the communique said. The Rev. Pier <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fumagalli </PERSON>, secretary of the commission, told reporters he expected the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> declaration would be honored. But he added `` I ca n't forsee what will happen in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' He said the questions of exactly where, when and how the prayer center would be built were being left to Polish church officials. Asked whether the pope had approved the communique, a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman, the Rev. <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Ercole </PERSON>, noted the statement had been published in the official <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> bulletin _ implying papal acceptance. <PERSON> Elan </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said that because of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> communique, his organization had decided to recommend to its constituencies around the world that they suspend their freeze on contacts with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` We welcome this very important step in restoring the good word of the church. It's time to move on and implement the agreement,'' he said. Rabbi <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hier </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weisenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the communique was a major policy reversal by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> that would remove a stumbling block in Catholic-Jewish relations. `` The issue was never over the rights of non-Jews to pray at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hier </PERSON> said. `` The issue was the building of permanent structures at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>.'' An estimated 2.5 million of the 4 million victims of <LOCATION> Auschwitz-Birkenau </LOCATION> were Jewish, and the convent's opponents argue that it is deeply offensive that Christian religious symbols tower over what is in effect their gravesite. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> has called the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord `` offensive,'' and he provoked further controversy with remarks deemed by many to be anti-Semitic. An estimated 1.5 million Christians also were killed at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>. The proposal to remove the convent founded in 1984 just outside the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> fence has found little sympathy among Poles. They argue that the nuns are not harming anyone and that thousands of the victims at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> were Polish political prisoners, including many priests and nuns. The issue has also caused divisions among cardinals. Last weekend, Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, archbishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said he supported Jewish efforts to move the nuns and that he was exploring talking to <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> about the dispute. Jewish groups have asked the Polish-born pope to step in and settle the controversy. But until today's announcement, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> had left it up to the Polish church to settle.

<TEXT>
 A film company said Tuesday that government censors have banned a video of the Chippendales, a troupe of male exotic dancers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who are drawing capacity crowds at a resort in a black homeland. <ORGANIZATION> Videovision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that censors declared the video `` lust-provoking'' and `` offensive.'' The company said it had acquired rights to distribute the video, entitled `` Tall, Dark and Handsome,'' because of the Chippendales' current box-office success at <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a sports-and-gambling resort in the tribal homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> The South African censors' rulings have no authority in <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> and three other nominally independent homelands. <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, entertainment director at <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said she was surprised by the censors' decision. `` There is nothing salacious about the Chippendales' show,'' she said. `` It is good, clean, wholesome fun.'' <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> regularly offers nude revues featuring female dancers. The Chippendales are the first all-male troupe to perform a comparable revue, and have been playing to sold-out houses.

<HEAD>Saint's Blood Liquifies in Naples on Schedule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For thousands of Neapolitans who gathered at the cathedral on Tuesday the news could not have been better. The dried blood of the city's patron saint, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Januarius </LOCATION>, liquified right on schedule. The city's archbishop, Cardinal <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Giordano </PERSON>, announced the `` miracle'' to 5,000 people after the faithful had prayed for only eight minutes. The blood of the saint, who was beheaded for his faith in A.D. 305, almost always turns to liquid on Sept. 19, the day marking his death, and two other days during the year. Last year, the liquification took 34 minutes after prayers began. Superstition has it that bad luck or disaster will follow if the dried blood does not liquify. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has not classified the liquification as a miracle and generally disapproves of the way it is linked to misfortune. Italian scientists have theorized that the contents of the vial holding the dried blood liquifies from the warmth of the hands holding it.

 The jury at <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud trial today watched a videotape in which the TV evangelist pleaded for millions in donations while assuring followers, `` I would not lie to you about anything.'' Prosecutors on Monday began showing the eight-hour tape culled from broadcasts of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s `` The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Show.'' On the tape, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> asked followers to send $ 1,000 in exchange for `` lifetime partnerships'' guaranteeing three nights' lodging a year for life at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park. A segment played today had <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> encouraging viewers to use their credit cards to buy a partnership. `` I'm sincere, I would not lie to you about anything,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told viewers in 1984. He explained that he paid for his own partnership by credit card because he did not have the cash. `` Mr. IRS got to me first, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> just took everything we could scrape together,'' he said. On Monday, actor <PERSON> Efrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> testified that the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board of directors, on which he once served, was little more than a rubber stamp for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of diverting more than $ 3.7 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money raised from the partnerships so that he could live in style. If convicted on all 24 counts, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $ 5 million. Witnesses have testified they bought the partnerships but could not get rooms. Others testified that partnerships were oversold and that the money often was used to cover <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s day-to-day operating costs rather than finance construction of the guaranteed rooms. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, who compiled the videotape, said more than 66,000 partnerships were sold to viewers by the time <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, despite a publicized limit of 25,000. `` All we need is 25,000 people to become members,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said on a program televised Feb. 20, 1984. `` That's all the memberships we can have in the Heritage Grand Hotel. In two weeks, we will be closed.'' On the tape, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> consistently mentioned the restrictions. `` When we reach the cutoff number, we will have to refuse the gifts,'' he told viewers. `` To be honest, we ca n't offer more memberships than we can physically handle.'' On a March 7, 1984, show, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told viewers that about 1,000 partnerships had been sold each day since the promotion began 13 days earlier. But <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> said records showed fewer than 7,300 had been sold at that point. About a week earlier, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said 12,500 partnerships had been sold. `` The memberships will be gone in a few days,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> testified that the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board of directors did not challenge <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` It was called a board of directors, but at no time did it operate like one,'' said <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON>, star of `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'' television series and board member from 1981 to 1986. `` It was a board of approval or affirmation only.'' Asked if he recalled approving a $ 390,000 bonus for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> said, `` Oh no, oh no.'' The white-haired actor, who testified during a break in the production in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> of a television series, `` Zorro,'' said the board was not informed of financial problems at its meetings. `` The financial condition of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> was never discussed,'' he said. Asked if he would have approved bonuses had he known about the financial condition of the ministry, <PERSON> Zimbalist </PERSON> said, `` I think I would have left the board at that point if that were the case.''

 The Communist Party today handed President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a chance next year to overhaul the party, which he said was being left behind by the nation's rapid social changes. The party's 251-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, its policy-making body, opened a meeting primarily devoted to ethnic unrest throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But its first task was to reschedule the next congress of about 5,000 party delegates for October 1990, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. `` The decision to convene the congress at an earlier date is dictated by the need to thoroughly update the party itself, with regard for its new role as the political vanguard of society during the state of restructuring,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said the need to renew the party applied to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> itself. A congress theoretically is the party's most powerful body, setting broad policy lines as well as determining the membership of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the ruling Politburo. It historically has reviewed the leadership's economic plans for the ensuing five years. Congresses are usually held every five years, and by party regulations the next congress would not have had to take place before early 1991. The last, the 27th in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s history, was held in February 1986 That was less than a year after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power, when the Soviet leader had not yet accumulated as much power as he has now. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed concern that the party is lagging behind the political reforms he has set in motion _ including the shift of more political power to elected government bodies. `` The reconstruction forces are going at such a rhythm that we often can not catch up with them,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He said many party organizations were slow to grasp the need for change, and `` in this, we lose a great deal.'' `` We can not leave things as they are, especially since fundamental economic and social processes are unfolding and an ideological and political struggle is under way over key problems of social development,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Some party stalwarts have said they fear the only legal political party in the country is losing its grip on power, as the legislature strengthens under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform and frustrated citizens start taking local power into their own hands. In addition to dissatisfaction with the poor state of the economy, ethnic disputes across the country threaten to imperil <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform drive. On the eve of today's meeting, <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> activists appealed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to order an end to what they call an economic blockade imposed on their <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> republic by neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, two policemen were knifed to death and two others beaten by a mob of at least 200 people Monday near a blockaded road in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The crowd attacking the policemen, who were investigating an earlier dispute, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> territory is among the oldest and most intractable facing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 ethnic groups. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s call for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s assistance to get supplies of food, building materials and fuel from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> shows how the ethnic problems interlock with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic difficulties. `` There's no salt. There's no sugar. There's no oil, said <PERSON> Rem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ananikyan </PERSON>, an editor of the official Armenian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION>. Worse yet, he said that since the flow of supplies through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> dried up almost two months ago, reconstruction of northwestern Armenian cities devastated by December's earthquake had stopped. In a draft document published last month, the party suggested that it is willing to look into opening the agreement made almost 70 years ago by which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was formed on the ashes of czarist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. Besides <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> face ethnic disputes in at least seven other republics. Some have been marked by persistent violence, with more than 200 people killed in the past 18 months. Communist Party officials in the three Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> have joined in varying degrees with informal political movements that are demanding sovereignty from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. That is a worrisome prospect for many in the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> at a time when some top officials are openly questioning whether the party is losing its grip on power.

 Ten years after Soviet forces intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the official press disclosed Tuesday that the top Soviet soldier in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> opposed the move and lost his job because of it. Gen. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlovsky </PERSON> was overruled by then-Soviet President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> with the unanimous backing of the Communist Party Politburo, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. The page-long article, printed in the paper's latest edition on the decision to enter <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, was based on <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s recollections of his conversations with his father, former Soviet Foreign Minister and President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, and an interview with <PERSON> Pavlovsky </PERSON>. The report was the first in the Soviet press to disclose high-level military opposition to the decision to enter <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Before the Soviets completed their withdrawal on Feb. 15, 13,000 Soviet soldiers were killed. The war between forces of the pro-Soviet Afghan government and anti-Marxist rebels continues. The newspaper report is part of a painful re-evluation of the Soviet experience in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, spurred by the return of thousands of soldiers who suffered wounds in fighting or have not been able to readjust to life at home. `` I reported to <PERSON> Dmitiri </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>, Politburo member, minister of defense and marshal of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, that the entrance of our soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was not necesary,'' <PERSON> Pavlovsky </PERSON> told the paper. He said he proposed instead that the Politburo send a representative to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to express <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s fears that <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Hafizullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> would turn toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Soviet diplomats in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> at the time did not understand the country, and no one took into account its history of guerrilla resistance to foreign power, <PERSON> Pavlovsky </PERSON> said. The actual date of the Soviet intervention, Dec. 27, 1979, was scheduled one day ahead of a meeting in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> between Afghan leaders and the ambassador of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pavlovsky </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a close ally of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has served as a base and conduit of military supplies to the Afghan rebels. <PERSON> Pavlovsky </PERSON>, now 80 years old, at the time was not only commander of Soviet advisers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but also a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a deputy defense minister and commander of Soviet ground forces. But when he returned from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> he was removed from his <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> posts and sent to serve in a group of military inspectors, <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> said. The paper's political observer, <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Belyaev </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> in September 1979 turned down the appeal of Afghan leader <PERSON> Nur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> for Soviet soldiers to help fight the anti-Marxist resistance. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> that intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Soviet soldiers would turn the majority of the population against the pro-Soviet government, <PERSON> Belyaev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON> had been installed as president after a coup in April 1978. But shortly after <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, the Afghan leader was killed in an dispute within the party, and <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> took over. `` <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was shaken by the murder of <PERSON> Taraki </PERSON>, who not long ago had been his guest and thought that <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s group could reach an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> quoted his father. The elder <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> died in July. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> was killed when Soviet soldiers entered the country, and he was replaced by <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>. The decision to enter <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been criticized widely in recent years as one made by a very small group of people. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, citing his father's recollections, noted that the decision was indeed made behind the closed doors of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s office But he said that it then was approved by a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and that no one there or in the leadership of the Soviet republics spoke out against the decision. `` You can disagree with this decision today, after 10 years, but there is no basis to place under doubt the political foundations of our aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said.

 Army scientists are gaining ground in their quest for the ultimate smoke screen, a `` universal obscurant'' that would baffle an enemy, fool `` smart'' weapons and conceal friendly forces. Smoke is known to have cloaked some battles of the Peloponnesian War in the fifth century B.C. and the same tactic plays a major role in modern warfare, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s smoke and obscurant project at this remote desert installation. `` In the greater scheme of things, it's one of the most economical methods of providing a defensive and offensive posture,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` It's a superb countermeasure to high-tech weapons.'' American and Soviet interest in the subject intensified when smoke was used to mask Israeli tanks from anti-tank guided missiles during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. But the Soviets, who frequently used large-scale smoke screens in World War II, jumped to an early lead and are believed to be developing a `` universal obscurant,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Newing </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Smoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Proponency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McClellan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Smokes are aerosols created by combustion of materials such as phosphorus or vapor condensations from fog oil or diesel oil, while obscurants include metallic chaff _ such as the shreds of aluminum foil dropped from planes in World War II to reflect false images on enemy radar _ or chemicals Smoke, dispersed by generators or packaged in canisters and fired from tanks, mortars, artillery or rockets, can blind opposing forces or camouflage friendly troops from artillery or air attack. Delivered in the same way, obscurants can scatter the radiant energy that soldiers and `` smart'' weapons use to track a target by radar, thermal-infrared wavelengths or radio emissions. A heat-seeking missile, for example, focuses on infrared wavelengths but can be deflected or misguided by an obscurant that scatters the infrared energy, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> are becoming increasingly dependent on weapons systems that have electro-optical devices ... and we are sometimes critically dependent on these weapons to work,'' <PERSON> Newing </PERSON> said. `` Smoke and obscurants have the potential for degrading or defeating them.'' In the past five years, significant progress has been made in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s research into a universal, or multi-spectral, obscurant designed to be effective across the electromagnetic spectrum. Such an obscurant might be made of airborne particulates capable of absorbing, scattering or reflecting electromagnetic energy, or even form a self-radiating source that would make it impossible for an enemy to distinguish between cloud and target. Details are classified, but <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said field tests with soldiers are just a few years away. `` We're probably 80 percent down the road to achieving the goal,'' he said. `` It's well within sight.'' The value of a universal obscurant is its flexibility, <PERSON> Newing </PERSON> said. `` If you know what type of sensors your adversary has, and you know what sensors you have, you can tailor your obscurant to affect him and not you,'' he said. In the meantime, <PERSON> Newing </PERSON> said, soldiers receive regular training in the use of smoke and obscurants, particularly in light of the Soviet effort. `` Both of us are investing in modern technology and that's increasing the lethality out there,'' he said `` And when you have something like obscurants that can alter lethality, it raises some flags.'' Smoke and obscurants were used at Dugway last summer when more than 12,000 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and reserve artillery soldiers gathered for a live-fire training exercise. `` We're in a constant effort to make sure that smoke and obscurants are spread and integrated as a system across all the different types of branches _ artillery, aviation and infantry,'' <PERSON> Newey </PERSON> said. `` The Army is not underestimating the threat. We're taking it seriously.

 Hurricane Hugo spun toward the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> today after thrashing <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> with 125 mph winds, leaving more than 50,000 people homeless throughout the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. An official reported at least 25 dead. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> hit northeastern <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and then skirted its populous northern coast on Monday. It roared on to the northwest and toward open water, its hurricane-force winds missing the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. At noon EDT today, the hurricane's center was near latitude 22.2 degrees north and longitude 68.5 west, about 175 miles east northeast of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the southern <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Winds fell to 105 mph. Forecasters said it likely would hit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland later in the week but said it was too early to predict where. Cruise ships steamed out of the way, residents prepared along the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> residents jammed the phone lines of insurance companies for financial protection. `` It's a long way from any potential landfall,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. `` Unfortunately, the higher likelihood is that it will turn more west and could make landfall anywhere from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.'' At least 25 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> died from the storm, said <PERSON> Cizanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Oronoz </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON>, said only two people died on <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The two died while trying to remove a TV antenna Sunday in preparation for the storm, she said. She said no other deaths had been reported in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> reported its preliminary statement that said 25 had died on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth was incorrect. Ms. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> gave no breakdown on where the other reported victims had died, but scattered fatalities were reported throughout the heavily visited tourist islands of the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> left a trail of smashed homes, power failures and injuries in <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> since Sunday, and widespread looting by machete-wielding mobs was reported on the island of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Widespread evacuations apparently lessened the chance of fatalities. Sailboats were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feet on shore in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>, and some waterfront businesses have disappeared. `` We were all huddled together in the corridor when the wind took off the roof of the house,'' said 14-year-old <PERSON> Didier </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacoby-Kaoly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. Cleanup efforts were under way today throughout <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez-Colon </PERSON> said at least 27,900 people were left homeless and asked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to declare it a disaster area. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s winds overturned cars, peeled roofs off houses and office buildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging into streets in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, where one-third of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth's 3.3 million people live. The winds ripped out glass, walls and furnishings from the top four floors of a 25-story building in the <LOCATION> Santurce </LOCATION> section, leaving only beams remaining. Fifty airplanes were reported destroyed at the airport in <LOCATION> Isla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>. Looters stripped shops of their goods in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. Officials were working to restore power, which was cut to 75 percent of the island. Police cars with flashing lights patrolled <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> streets early today. Major streets were cleared, but secondary streets remained clogged with power lines, tree limbs, sheets of metal and shattered glass. Flooding made many roads impassable, and international communications were disrupted. In the northeast town of <LOCATION> Luquillo </LOCATION>, 10 homes were swept downriver and six families were reported missing, the weather service office said. Civil Defense officials reported 80 percent of the homes on the Puerto Rican islands of <LOCATION> Vieques </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Culebra </LOCATION> were were either destroyed or damaged. Secretary of the Interior <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said $ 500,000 in emergency assistance funds were released to aid storm-stricken areas of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The weather service said maximum sustained winds had slowed to near 105 mph with hurricane-force winds extending up to 60 miles from the center. It was moving to the northwest at 12 mph and was expected to continue in that direction during the next 24 hours. A hurricane watch was in effect for the central <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and tropical storm warnings for the southern <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Since Sunday, the storm has caused widespread damage in <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Six people were killed and hundreds of buildings were flattened on the British island of <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>, the British government said today. It said nearly all of the 12,000 island residents were homeless. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> marines landed on <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION> to help clear the airport runway so planes could deliver aid supplies. British Overseas Aid Minister <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Chalker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would provide $ 1.57 million in emergency aid to islands struck by the hurricane. Five people were reported killed, 84 injured and about 15,000 homeless on the French island of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. Two were killed in <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> assigned 3,000 soldiers, two military transport aircraft and four cargo vessels to assist in restoring communications and emergency services to <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> pledged to rebuild `` what was destroyed.'' Most of the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>' 106,000 residents live on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, where a ham radio operator said winds had torn off the roofs of up to 75 percent of the homes. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> is the fourth hurricane of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season and is the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Tropical Storm Iris rose in the wake of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and forecasters advised residents of the battered <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> to keep a close watch on the new storm. They said <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, with 50 mph winds, was about 300 miles east of the <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Monday night and was moving north-northwest at about 18 mph.

 <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s rulers decorated departing Vietnamese military chiefs Tuesday and said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 11-year occupation was not only legal but also `` humanitarian'' because it stopped massacres by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. In a ceremony, authorities presented the Angkor Order _ a top <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> military distinction _ to commanders of the eight army, navy and air force units that are to begin leaving Thursday in what <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says will be the pullout of its last 26,000 troops. <PERSON> Chea </PERSON> <PERSON> Sim </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, pinned medals on the officers before making a speech praising them for having toppled the fanatical <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime in late 1978. `` The presence of the Vietnamese in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during the last 10 years is a legal act and humanitarian aid,'' he said of the intervention, which was condemned by many non-Communist nations as a violation of international law and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> charter. `` The Khmer Rouge killed people. The people were scared all the time,'' he said. `` The presence of the Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has saved Cambodian lives.'' <PERSON> Chea </PERSON> <PERSON> Sim </PERSON> quoted a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> proverb: `` Best friends help each other in time of need.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed a million people during its nearly four-year experiment in creating a `` pure'' peasant society. It now is the largest member of the three-party guerrilla coalition fighting the Vietnamese and the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government that was installed days after the invasion. The fighting could escalate sharply after the Vietnamese pullout because the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> forces will stand alone against the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chea </PERSON> <PERSON> Sim </PERSON>, also president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the guerrillas still oppose his government although it has amended the constitution, overseen the Vietnamese pullout, and tried to find a political settlement. He said that at the 19-nation talks in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, `` The enemy tried to get the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> back to power ... to get the murderers to kill more people.'' The talks in August collapsed when <PERSON> Phnom </PERSON> <PERSON> Penh </PERSON> rejected guerrilla demands that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> join a transitional government before an election is held. The guerrillas have charged that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is hiding and disguising troops instead of withdrawing them. They said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently escalated arms supplies to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, a charge the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rashit </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamidouline </PERSON>, denied Monday. In <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Tuesday, the Vietnamese government refused to rule out fighting another war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Thai </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, also claimed that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s major achievement during the war was not strategic but involved saving the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people from genocide. He tacitly acknowledged that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> had failed in its goal to wipe out <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance when he predicted factional fighting would continue in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the Vietnamese army withdraws. The officer spoke at a news conference to announce the start of the last stage of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal, which began in July 1988. `` In case of a threat of the genocidal regime coming back then I think the government of the state of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> would call on the international community for help,'' he said. If called on for assistance, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> said, the Vietnamese army `` would then announce its decision.'' At the Bassack Hall in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, a clanging band blared martial music as officials hailed the 150 Vietnamese soldiers at Tuesday's two-hour ceremony The soldiers received their decorations on a stage holding this nation's autocrats _ the military commanders and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, its highest body. A red curtain behind them displayed side-by-side national emblems _ <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s yellow star and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Angkor Wat temple. After shrill, militant speeches laden with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> jargon, hundreds of school children wearing red kerchiefs _ the party's `` young pioneers'' _ marched into the hall beating drums and other instruments A little girl climbed onstage and _ her face hidden by the microphones on the podium _ hailed the Vietnamese troops and condemned the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> `` supported by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` Long live the heroic Vietnamese soldiers,'' she shouted three times, a fist thrust high in the air.

 A judge has ordered arrest warrants for a former Israeli army colonel and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian alleged to have trained hit squads for Colombian drug cartels, officials said today. A spokeswoman for the Department of Security said in a telephone interview that a 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge issued the order Monday and it was passed to <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, the international police organization. The arrest order for <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a reserve lieutenant colonel in the Israeli army, came a month after <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> media reported he and others trained gunmen for the cocaine cartels. In <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, police said today they were holding a man with a `` strong resemblance'' to <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, one of the reputed leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. But officials would not confirm the identity of the man, arrested on the Colombian border. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, now home in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, has said he trained Colombian farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas. He said that if the men he trained were involved in drugs he was not aware of that. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was the subject of a police investigation in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> along with five other Israelis suspected of training gunmen for Columbian drug lords. The investigation was completed Sept. 8 but police have not disclosed their findings and <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> has not been charged. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has no extradition treaty with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had received no official communications from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> regarding charges against Israelis. The Colombian spokeswoman, <PERSON> Diva </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, said a second warrant was issued for <PERSON> Arik </PERSON> <PERSON> Acek </PERSON>, another Israeli whom she said allegedly helped <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> leave <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. She identified <PERSON> Acek </PERSON> as a civilian who had an arms business in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and flower shops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` They are wanted for violating laws against conspiring, teaching and enlisting civilians in military operations without the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> said. She said the two are believed to have entered <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in August 1988 and to have left earlier this year after reports surfaced of foreign mercenaries training hit squads for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cali </ORGANIZATION> drug cartels. Reached in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said: `` I did n't flee <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, I left legally, with an exit stamp on my passport.'' An AP reporter saw the stamp in a recent interview. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Acek </PERSON> as a friend who helped him with Spanish translation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week began investigating reports of foreign mercenaries in the country. Drug traffickers have used their private armies to kill more than 1,000 Colombian leftists in the last four years. The cartels are also waging a violent war with the government. On Monday, two more bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, one injuring three people, and troops battling drug gang violence reported seizing a 22,000-acre ranch owned by a man reputed to be among top cocaine barons. Security was stepped up at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which was struck Sunday night by a rocket that did not explode. The bombs exploded and at a government telephone company's substation, a police spokesman said No one has claimed responsibility for a rash of terrorist shootings and bombings since Aug. 18, when the government cracked down on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s powerful drug bosses. There have been 47 bombings with 121 people injured in the last three weeks. Four people have died. No one claimed responsibility, but security forces assume all were the work of drug traffickers. The shopping center explosion in this capital of 6 million people injured a child, a man and a woman, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> said in a report from the scene. A man was seen placing the bomb in a pile of garbage bags in front of a store, witnesses told an <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> reporter. Soldiers on Sunday seized a 22,000-acre ranch belonging to billionaire <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, said a spokesman with the army's 13th Brigade headquarters in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON> is suspected of being a key figure in the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel that supplies most of the cocaine distributed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Also seized with the ranch in central <LOCATION> Cundinamarca </LOCATION> state were 5,000 head of cattle and 300 show horses, he said. Last month, the army seized 18 ranches belonging to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, who is among 12 Colombian drug figures wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The ranches were seized under emergency powers instituted by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to counter a wave of terror by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine lords

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met Tuesday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> <PERSON> Young-hoon </PERSON>, while hundreds of student radicals held rallies denouncing the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s recent democratic reforms but asked <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> why political violence continued, a South Korean official said. <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> replied that it was because the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people still have little experience with democracy and tend to shun compromise and stick to a `` logic of choosing between black and white,'' the source said. The official, who demanded anonymity, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> discussed a wide range of issues, including the future of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman, said they discussed subjects ranging from President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Oct. 26 to <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations. `` The meeting was productive, and I am looking forward to meeting and learning about the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters. Neither he nor <PERSON> Kang </PERSON> would describe what they discussed. During the 45-minute meeting, hundreds of radical students held anti-government, anti-U.S. rallies on at least five college campuses. The students represent a small minority that has failed to win widespread support. Hundreds of riot police ringed the schools, but there were no reports of arrests or injuries. At <ORGANIZATION> Kyunghee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, 50 students burned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and an effigy of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. They also shouted slogans calling the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, a `` <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> master of political manipulation.'' Protests were also reported at three other campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where 100 students burned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and chanted, `` We oppose <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit to the death.'' In the southern provincial city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 500 radical students shouted `` Yankee go home!'' and battled police with firebombs and rocks, police said. The protests were small by South Korean standards, and dissident groups made no effort to organize street demonstrations against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit. The radicals are demanding an end to close ties with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and expulsion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is on the first stop of an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> trip that also will take him to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. He meets on Wednesday with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and heads of the main opposition political parties, which often clash with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. South Korean opposition leaders planned to tell <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> about their concerns over deteriorating human rights, opposition party officials said. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> report released Sunday said 2,094 people had been detained on political charges since <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> came to power in February 1988. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who demanded anonymity, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would urge the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government to show greater respect for human rights in view of the jailings and other government moves to curb opposition. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has introduced broad democratic reforms since he took office, but opposition groups claim that the reforms made so far are not enough. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have expressed concern about the recent indictment of top South Korean opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> on charges connected with an opposition lawmaker's secret trip to <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last year. Under South Korean law, failure to report visits to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can be punished by a five-year prison term. The two Koreas are bitter enemies.

 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is wrestling with the question of whether he can remain an effective liberal in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> following the disclosure of his relationship with a male prostitute, his friends and allies say. An aide to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said Monday the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat will not resign his congressional seat despite calls for his resignation by newspapers in his district. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> declined to be interviewed Monday, but in a weekend interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said he will not seek re-election next year if he decides the controversy hurts the liberal causes he has espoused during 10 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The question for him to decide, that will make the difference ... is whether he believes he could be an effective member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that he would not do this just to go through the motions,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s sister and a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> political consultant. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> disclosed his homosexuality in 1987 and won re-election the next year with 70 percent of the vote in a district that has elected him five times to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Democratic strategists said they believe <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s support within his own district remains strong, despite the revelations about his involvement with prostitute <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>. But they said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> may feel pressure to resign because of the scandal's effects on his issues or other Democrats. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, which enthusiastically endorsed <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> throughout his political career, said in an editorial Sunday that he should resign for `` his own good, and for the good of his constituents, his causes and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Anchor, a small but influential Roman Catholic newspaper in his district, called on <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to resign last week. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s administrative assistant, said: `` Barney will not resign. He wants to see the process with the <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> move forward.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee is investigating <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s dealings with <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, at <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s request. One group of supporters, the liberal arms-control group Council for a <ORGANIZATION> Livable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, circulated a letter Monday urging <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> to ignore calls for his resignation. It said, `` Even a <LOCATION> Barney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Frank </LOCATION> whose effectiveness in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is somewhat diminished this year still ranks among the most effective members in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has acknowledged that he paid <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> for sexual relations after responding to an ad in a gay newspaper in 1985, and then hired him as a personal assistant. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said hoped to help <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> give up his past, but <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> said he used <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s apartment for prostitution and that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was aware of his activities. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> says he did not know. In a taped interview on the `` Geraldo'' talk show telecast today, <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> elaborated on his claims, saying he ran a female escort service called `` A Touch of Class,'' from the congressman's apartment A friend who ran a male escort service also occasionally call-forwarded telephone service to <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, he said. `` I more or less served as a reservation clerk for the girls,'' he said. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> `` was n't the first prostitute I had used.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said that because of his difficulties he will lessen his role on one issue _ the investigation of alleged influence-peddling at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee leading the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigation. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has been outspoken in a number of liberal causes, but particularly in areas of ethics legislation, housing, and homosexual rights. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Foscarinis </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Homelessness and Poverty, described <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> as one of the leading advocates for housing programs in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and said his problems are a concern to other housing advocates. `` I think there's some concern about the effect that this will have on his advocacy,'' she said. `` The question is whether the issue will become so consuming that it will obscure his ability to take positions on substantive issues.'' <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtman </PERSON>, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, said other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have overcome embarrassing personal disclosures or poor judgment, adding that in the long term `` his effectiveness as an important public servant should in no way be harmed by his personal misjudgments.'' <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichard </PERSON>, director of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s district office in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said calls and letters have been running 8-to-1 in support.

He then diverted money from the fund to friends and relatives and bought a trailer and furniture for his home, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Hibbs </PERSON> repaid the money taken from the fund by putting family members and others on the state payroll in jobs that required little or no work and having their salaries deposited into the scholarship fund. He was also convicted of conspiring to collect $ 90,000 in insurance on a race horse that never was sold for that amount.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, the son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, cited sloppy police tactics when he asked the <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overturn his conviction on a cocaine charge. `` The issue is how freely the government can enter a house in disguise,'' <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s lawyer, said Monday during oral arguments. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 26, was convicted last year of selling a quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police woman at his off-campus apartment in <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> in 1986. He served his sentence, but has appealed the conviction in an effort to clear his record. The court is not expected to rule before December. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> law professor, said state police should have found a witness or come up with solid evidence before sending an undercover officer to <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s home while he was a student at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harritt </PERSON> contended before the court that police did not violate <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s rights because the undercover officer was invited into his home, clearly stated her intention to buy cocaine and made the purchase without disguising her identity. `` The state sees this in a fundamentally different way,'' she said. `` This case, in fact, does not involve a search. If the court believes that a search did take place, no warrant was needed because the officer was invited into the home.'' <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, who recently opened a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pasta shop, appeared at ease during the hearing, talking and laughing with lawyers. He would not comment before or after the hearing, other than to compliment his lawyers and express confidence the court would be fair. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was sentenced to a term of one to five years, with all but four months suspended. He served the four months in a so-called `` house arrest'' program that allowed him to live in a $ 1,500-a-month apartment with maid service and cable television. The trial followed legal wrangling over whether <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was selectively prosecuted due to his mother's fame. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> brief again raised the claim, but she did not cover the issue during oral arguments.

 <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawshea </PERSON> filed for a $ 1,118 rent refund on his 1983 <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> state income taxes, hoping state tax collectors would n't notice that he had been in prison for most of that tax year. They did n't. <PERSON> Lawshea </PERSON> filed for a slightly bigger rent return the following year. He got that, too. Minnesotans can deduct a percentage of their rent as a homestead tax credit; the percentage changes from year to year. But state revenue agents caught on to <LOCATION> Lawshea </LOCATION>, an inmate at the <ORGANIZATION> Stillwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 when they noticed an invalid Social Security number on his tax return, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Showel </PERSON>, director of criminal apprehension for the state <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lawshea </PERSON> was an inmate of the <ORGANIZATION> Stillwater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> from 1983 to October 1984 for a fraud conviction. <PERSON> Lawshea </PERSON>, 34, pleaded guilty Monday to filing a false tax return for the 1983 tax year. An identical charge for the 1984 tax year was dropped as part of a plea agreement, <PERSON> Showel </PERSON> said. Sentencing was set for Jan. 26; he faces a maximum of 24 months. According to court records, <PERSON> Lawshea </PERSON> filed for the $ 1,118 rent refund on a <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> `` apartment'' that turned out to be a bar and restaurant. He received and cashed the check and repeated the offense in 1985 when he filed for a $ 1,125 credit for the 1984 tax year, <PERSON> Showel </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Arney </PERSON> said his office handles many cases of fraud dreamed up by inmates at the two state prisons in the county. Past cases include credit-card fraud and bad-check-cashing schemes, he said. `` We've had everything you can think of, but this rates high on the creativity scale,'' <PERSON> Arney </PERSON> said.

The changes have produced pressures on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and on Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who likely is sending his foreign minister with new ideas for cuts in strategic arms, the experts say. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, is being pushed to respond more warmly to changes under way in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will talk with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Thursday at the White House, then will head for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Hole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, to meet through the weekend with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. An exploding volcano might be a more fitting backdrop than the immovable <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> for the Baker-Shevardnadze discussion of changes under way in the communist world. Since they last met in July, a major postwar milestone has been passed, the installation of a Solidarity government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the first non-communist regime in the Soviet bloc. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation, is also moving toward a multi-party system, and the speaker of the Hungarian parliament was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday predicting his nation would ultimately leave the Soviet-led military alliance. Precisely that step precipitated the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1956. Also, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s allowing of thousands of East German refugees to cross into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> has riveted world attention on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has had to concern himself at home with surging sentiment for more self-determination _ or even independence _ in a growing number of Soviet republics. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday, `` The tremendous change in the nature of our discourse with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership is primarily the result of unprecedented and exciting developments which are taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' But the crushing of pro-democracy forces in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and warnings by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of a possible conservative coup in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are stark reminders that all change is not permanent, and that superpower relations could be plunged back into the bad old days of the Cold War. `` Things may well get out of control, but they are unlikely to lead to a peaceful evolution toward liberal democracy'' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, retired Lt. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said in a speech Sept. 9. `` Civil war and disorder followed by reassertion of authoritarianism seem more probable,'' said <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, who spent his military career watching the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including a stint as head of the supersecretive <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in reforming Soviet foreign policy, has withdrawn threatening tank forces from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, announced a cut of 500,000 in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, and declared a `` defensive doctrine.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made many people in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believe that the Soviet military threat has gone away. It has not, of course, but there are some signs that it will decline,'' said <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, advocating a cautious response, similar to that espoused by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. The administration's restraint has come under from fire from liberals, who want the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to encourage change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and supply greater levels of aid to nations like <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that are on the troubled road of reform. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must reach beyond the status quo thinking that appears to dominate administration speaking,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> said Monday. `` He must cast aside ambivalence and hesitation and timidity and adopt a more energetic and engaged policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials have moved within the past week to keep pace with changes in the Soviet bloc, saying they will double food deliveries to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, to $ 100 million, and grant most-favored-nation status to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to reduce tariffs on Hungarian exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president reacted carefully Monday when asked about possible reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. That's for the Germans to decide, he answered, though he added that such a move should not be viewed `` as bad for Western interests.'' The administration has also tried to expand the U.S.-Soviet dialogue to new areas such as fighting terrorism and drug trafficking and cleaning up the environment. The plan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, is to integrate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> more deeply into the community of law-abiding nations. `` Today, we are witnessing what are potentially the first steps in the transformation of a totalitarian society into one governed by the rule of law,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry. `` And as these changes unfold, the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could move from an adversarial to a cooperative one,'' he said. In addition the expanding dialogue, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will push hard for arms control progress when he meets <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House Thursday and may be carrying a new <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> proposal, experts say. `` It would be customary'' for <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to hand <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a letter from the Soviet leader, and `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> being <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, it would not be too surprising for it contain some dramatic proposals,'' said one administration official, speaking on condition he not be further identified. Although sticking points remain in the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB-, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are expected to announce several important steps on other topics, including: _ An `` agreed statement'' expanding superpower human rights dialogue from such traditional areas as emigration to new topics involving cooperation on occupational safety, the environment and the criminal code. _ A agreement on determining the chemical weapon stockpiles of each side preliminary to a multilateral agreement sharply curbing the production or possession of such arms. _ A protocol on verifying treaties signed in 1974 and 1976, but never ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, barring each side from testing nuclear devices of greater than 150 kilotons.

 After she recovers from a heart attack, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> will have to give up the hectic schedule that earned her a Nobel Peace Prize and adapt to a slower pace, her doctors said Tuesday. `` Her heart is old and she's not young,'' Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON>, an infectious disease specialist from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, told a news conference. `` At least for the time being, she will have to change her lifestyle.'' A medical bulletin issued late Tuesday said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s condition is improving and she has had no chest pains since Monday Her temperature also has been normal, one of her physicians said. Despite recent health problems, the 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun has traveled the world incessantly to offer care and comfort to the poor. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work, suffered a heart attack on Sept. 8, three days after she was admitted to <LOCATION> Woodlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Home </LOCATION> with a high fever and acute vomiting. Doctors attached a temporary pacemaker, but it was removed after she developed chest pains. She has been taking steroids since then, they said. `` Her temprature has been controlled, but the problem remains with her intermittent chest pains. We are rather concerned about that. Otherwise, she is comfortable,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Rajen </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>. `` The angina pain is serious but not critical,'' he said. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s temperature is now 97.6 and that she is conscious, eating well and resting comfortably. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> also said a viral infection that triggered the fever now is under control. He said doctors still do not know the cause and are awaiting results from blood samples sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` The virus, however, has affected her heart,'' he said. Doctors also said the frail nun had developed a secondary infection, which also has not been diagnosed. `` We are hopeful that this will go in a couple of days,'' <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON> said. Although they gave no time frame, doctors said <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>'s recovery probably will take longer than the normal four to six weeks The Yugoslav-born nun developed chest pains and a high fever Thursday, a week after the heart attack. Doctors said the setback may have been caused partly by a steady stream of visitors to the hospital's intensive care unit. On Monday, doctors said no one would be allowed to see her. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION> in October 1950 in an abandoned hostel donated by the city. The order, formally recognized by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1965, expanded and now has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to throw out his cocaine-peddling conviction, arguing that police set up the undercover buy on the basis of campus rumors, not hard evidence. `` The issue is how freely the government can enter a house in disguise,'' <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> argued Monday. `` This undercover was arranged solely on the basis of rumor, nothing like hard evidence, nothing like reasonable suspicion.'' The 26-year-old son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> was convicted last year of selling a quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police woman at his off-campus apartment in 1986 while a student at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> served four months' house arrest in a $ 1,500-a-month apartment with maid service and cable television but is seeking to clear his record. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> should have found a witness or located solid evidence before sending an undercover officer into <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s home But Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harritt </PERSON> countered that police did not violate <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>'s rights because the undercover officer was invited into his home, clearly stated her intention to buy cocaine and made the purchase without disguising her identity. `` -LRB- The officer -RRB- said, ` I understand I can buy some drugs from you,' and he said, ` Sure, come on in,''' <PERSON> Harritt </PERSON> told the court. `` She was not asked to explain anything about herself. He did n't ask her whether or not she was police.'' Associate Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dooley </PERSON> told <PERSON> Harritt </PERSON> he was troubled about some aspects of the probe, noting that rumors abound on college campuses. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, who has recently opened a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pasta shop, declined to comment other than to compliment his lawyers and express confidence the court would render a fair decision. His lawyers have argued also that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was selectively prosecuted because of his mother's fame.

 Voters went to the polls today in a 13-way primary that could bring a city councilman one step closer to becoming <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s first black mayor. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who is black, was considered the frontrunner in the non-partisan race, in which the top two vote-getters will advance to the general election. The councilman's opponent in November was expected to be city Attorney <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> or former King County Executive <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Revelle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> election superintendent, predicted 103,000 of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s 295,000 registered voters would go to the polls in the race to replace Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>. That's a moderate turnout of about 35 percent. <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>, who beat <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> four years ago, is not seeking a fourth term and has accepted a post at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 46, is a former broadcast reporter, <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> official and a banker. He said he jumped into the race because of what he called a divisive anti-school busing initiative. The measure will be on the November ballot. <PERSON> Jewett </PERSON> is co-sponsor of the initiative, and backers say he can ride it into the mayor's office. In <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to help celebrate the state centennial today, two <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members were favored to advance to the November general election.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that some of its facilities had sustained `` very heavy damage'' from Hurricane Hugo and that it was evacuating about 600 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers and dependents from a submarine center in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> as a precaution. `` Virtually every structure received some damage, some of it severe,'' at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Station at <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> told reporters. No significant injuries were reported, he added. The spokesman said a lack of full information meant that no cost estimates of the damage had been drawn up. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> hit northeastern <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and then skirted its populous northern coast Monday. Hurricane warnings were in effect for the southern <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Since Sunday, the storm also has caused widespread damage in <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s airfield at the <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roads </ORGANIZATION> station was closed overnight, but has since been reopened. Many of the runway's lights were damaged, <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. He said the military was evacuating approximately 600 people from the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Undersea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Andros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> as a precautionary measure. The evacuees are a mix of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government personnel, civilians and dependents of those who work at the center, which focuses on anti-submarine warfare, officials said. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> satellite tracking center on <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> `` suffered very heavy damage'' while a solar observatory at <ORGANIZATION> Ramey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> was also hit.

<TEXT>
 An under-cuddled German teddy bear fetched a world record $ 86,000 at an auction Tuesday, more than four times the previous highest price for a teddy bear and 60 times its catalogue estimate, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said. `` When I told the owner the news, he said: ` I think that works out at 1,000 pounds -LRB- $ 1,570 -RRB- a hair.' He was very pleased and very happy,'' said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s appraiser <PERSON> Bunny </PERSON> <PERSON> Campione </PERSON>. The two-tone bear, made by German manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Steiff </ORGANIZATION> in 1920, has unusually large eyes that `` make it look a little forlorn'' and is in such good condition `` it does n't look as if it has been cuddled very much,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Campione </PERSON> said the bear had been expected to sell for up to $ 7,800 but had earlier been listed in an auction house catalogue at $ 1,100 to $ 1,400. `` There is no justifiable reason why it made so much money,'' she said in a telephone interview. The previous highest auction price for a teddy bear was $ 19,000, paid at a Christie's auction in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on May 18 for a Steiff bear made between 1906 and 1909 for Princess <LOCATION> Xenia </LOCATION>, a cousin of Czar <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s record-busting bear is 24 inches long, has plush fur in blond and brown, amber-and-black glass eyes measuring about 1 inch in diameter, swivel joints, a humped back and widely spaced ears. The buyer, represented by a British agent, insisted on anonymity. The bear had belonged to an unidentified British man who inherited it from his grandmother, Mrs. <PERSON> Campione </PERSON> said. `` The grandmother considered him -LRB- the bear -RRB- to be very much her own and kept him away from the children who were allowed to see him but not to play with him,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Campione </PERSON>, a fine-doll expert, said she was baffled by the sale price for a bear that was hardly rare. `` A few thousand were made in 1920 instead of a few million,'' but it is in unusually `` superb condition,'' she said. `` Most of them are cuddled or kissed on the nose so much that the nose gets dented in, or get dragged around the garden by children.'' She speculated that the buyer may want the bear as a prototype for limited edition. At the first teddy bear auction organized by Mrs. <PERSON> Campione </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in 1982, the most expensive teddy went for $ 630. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiff </PERSON>'s lovable creations took the world by storm at the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> toy fair in 1903, and valuable teddies are now almost exclusively made by <PERSON> Steiff </PERSON> at the village of <LOCATION> Giengen </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that one of its retired justices was guilty of judicial misconduct for helping a female friend who was a lower-court judge. The ruling said retired Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> committed seven ethics violations, primarily for sitting on cases involving former Assistant Judge <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON> and for intimidating the state attorney general by personally delivering a letter urging that a criminal probe of Wheel be speeded up. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 72, was one of three <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices charged with misconduct in 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the court. The board alleged the three improperly used their clout to help Wheel, then an assistant judge in <LOCATION> Chittenden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in a variety of matters. The charges threw the five-member court into turmoil. Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> asked the three to step aside while the accusations were examined. They refused, but disqualified themselves from all cases involving anyone involved in the complaints, which affected hundreds of cases. The charges against Justice <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> were dropped for lack of a case. Justice <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> died before the allegations against him were resolved. A court employee testified that Wheel had been seen with her arms around <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wheel </PERSON> testified they were not close and did not have an affair. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> described their relationship as collegial. The <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> guilty of 11 counts of misconduct, but it was up to the state's high court to decide <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s fate Today, the high court dismissed four counts but upheld the others. `` A judge can never avoid the prestige and authority of the office he or she holds,'' said the court. `` That prestige and authority, however, may not be used to enhance personal relationships, or for selfish reasons, or to bestow favors.'' The court said it would hear arguments next week on what sanctions to impose against <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. Because <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> is retired, the sanctions range from a reprimand to suspension from service as a substitute justice on high court cases. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s pension will not be affected. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, said he and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> felt the decision was a `` mixed bag.'' The case was heard by a specially assigned court since most of the members who sat on the court with <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> disqualified themselves. Wheel was convicted in a separate criminal case involving allegations she billed the state for days she did not work.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, declaring that `` sound ecology and a strong economy can coexist,'' prodded <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today to pass his legislation to clean up the nation's fouled air. In a speech at a riverfront celebration of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 100th anniversary of statehood, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called upon `` all Americans to join in a renewed spirit of conservation,'' including recycling their trash and generating less waste. With House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the hometown <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman, at his side, the president said, `` When it comes to clear air, we need action on the legislation we've proposed _ now.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who sent the clean air bill to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on July 21, said, `` Every day that passes is another day we're postponing progress on clean air. ... Now it is up to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass this clean air legislation this year.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been sparring with the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over drugs and other issues, but <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters Monday he expects <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to send <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a clean air bill to his liking either late this year or early in 1990. `` It will be an achievement for both the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. The plan now is in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a 10-billion-ton reduction in acid rain-producing sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000, a 2-million-ton reduction in nitrous oxide and a 40 percent cut in other emissions that cause urban smog. It also calls for use of alternative fuels in 1 million vehicles by 1997. Environmentalists and their allies in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have criticized the goals as too modest and say the plan would leave too much to the discretion of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and in some cases to the affected industries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, winding up a two-day swing that also took him to centennial celebrations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, said the `` majestic'' <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> _ coursing through downtown <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> over waterfalls and volcanic outcroppings _ `` has been reborn'' from its once-polluted state, a symbol of the nation's environmental progress. `` I took this trip out West because I'm concerned ... about the future of the planet we share,'' the president said. `` Today I'm asking all Americans to join in a renewed spirit of conservation, a new commitment to a more careful stewardship of the natural world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for applying `` the creativity of the marketplace in the service of the environment. Sound ecology and a strong economy can coexist.'' He lauded a waste-disposal fee system in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> that he said has cut waste by nearly one-fourth. Those results, he said `` need to be duplicated everywhere in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Local communities, businesses large and small, individual families _ all can learn to generate less waste and recycle more of the waste that is generated,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. At the event witnessed by thousands in <LOCATION> Riverfront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s appearance `` a proud movement for the State of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' and `` a high honor'' for himself. The president returned the compliment, calling <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> `` a man of integrity, decency, fair play _ and _ OK, he's a Democrat, but he's a man I am very proud and honored to work with. After the speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> picked up shovels to plant a centennial elm sappling transplanted from a White House tree, then left the park to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aboard Air Force One. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a news conference Monday in the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chambers in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` to get on with'' his $ 7.9 billion anti-drug strategy. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want action.'' `` There's a certain frustration level when we come out with a sound program and two answers come out: spend more and raise taxes,'' he said. Elsewhere in the news conference, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: _ Announced plans to grant <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> most favored nation trading status in recognition of its political and economic reforms _ Said he feels `` in no rush'' to hold a summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended the pace of strategic arms negotiations, and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` not going to just react'' to proposals by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will see <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> at the White House on Thursday before the Soviet's weekend retreat with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. _ Said there is no `` hard intelligence evidence'' Colombian drug lords are targeting his family, but warned any attack would `` just bring down the total wrath of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and the American government. _ Called it too soon after the Tiananmen massacre to resume `` total normalcy'' of U.S.-China relations <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there are still `` great difficulties'' there, but he defended ties by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businessmen, including his brother, with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. _ Declared if the two Germanys decided to reunite, `` I do not think we should view that as bad for Western interests. _ Decried recent racial violence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and elsewhere, saying, `` It says something ugly whenever there's an incident of that nature. But he refused to call it a trend. _ Predicted not a single governor at next week's education summit wants the federal government to mandate changes in the nation's But in an earlier address to state legislators, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it may be time to consider `` radical changes'' because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools are not making the grade. _ Expressed hope that `` the winter will be kind to the environmental damage'' in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from the Exxon Valdez oil spill He said his decision not to visit <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on this Western trip was no indication of a lack of interest in the problem. `` We had an environmental Vice President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that went,'' he said. _ Indicated he does not know what `` the final answer'' will be if <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> seeks a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa to speak at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>

 A gunman forced a Moroccan passenger plane flying across the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> to land today on Grand Canary island, officials said. The police officer at <LOCATION> Gando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> said the two crew members and six passengers were allowed to leave the ATR-42 twin-engine turboprop about two hours after it touched down on this Spanish archipelago at 2:45 p.m. The unidentified gunman gave himself up about six hours after the aircraft landed, said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said no concessions were made to the gunman but had no information on a possible motive for the hijacking. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maroc </ORGANIZATION> aircraft was initially identified as a <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> by police. An official in the <LOCATION> Gando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> control tower, who would not give his name, said by telephone that the gunman had demanded to talk with the local representative of the Moroccan national airline in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palmas </LOCATION>. An attendant at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maroc </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palmas </LOCATION> said the flight had left the eastern town of <LOCATION> Smara </LOCATION> in the Moroccan-occupied <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> on a scheduled domestic flight west to the city of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aaiun </LOCATION>. Grand <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is 135 miles west of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> man has been charged with stealing 1.25 tons of silver shaped like <ORGANIZATION> Hershey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kisses </ORGANIZATION> from a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> mine where he once worked, authorities said today. Sheriff <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said officials hoped to get arrest warrants today or Wednesday for two other <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> people wanted in the Trinity Mine heist Aug. 26. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiden </PERSON>, 22, of Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, was arrested Saturday and jailed on $ 105,000 bail on charges of embezzlement and conspiracy, <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said. The $ 200,000-plus cache of partially processed silver is still missing. The heist occurred when two shotgun-toting masked robbers bound two mine employees with duct tape and then took more than an hour in the middle of the night to haul the 1.25 tons of silver into a waiting pickup. The robbers then left spikes in the road to flatten tires of pursuers. Police immediately theorized the heist was commited by people with inside information. Authorities were led to <PERSON> Aiden </PERSON> based on interviews with past and present mine workers that revealed several small silver thefts at the mine, <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said. `` Once information about some other minor silver thefts began surfacing, people started getting nervous and talking,'' <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said. Officials gave lie detector tests to past and present employees of the mine, 90 miles northeast of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The fledgling market for private long-term care insurance is growing rapidly but `` inherent limitations'' will halt the trend long before protection reaches most Americans, says a leading expert on social insurance. In a new book, former Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> says private insurance `` can not possibly do the job alone'' and argues for a new government program akin to Social Security to finance basic long-term care protection for all Americans. `` Only a plan that anticipates the needs of society as a whole and spreads the risk as broadly as possible can meet the need at a cost that is bearable for each of us,'' Ball writes in the book, `` Because We're All In This Together.'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said that while long-term care coverage gradually is improving from the earliest expensive and restrictive policies, private insurers will be unable to offer adequate protection that most Americans can afford. `` They know exactly what consumers want _ but the dilemma is that when those wants are met, the cost goes up very considerably, shrinking the market for the newly improved policies,'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> wrote. One major problem is that the policies mainly attract the elderly and others likely to need coverage, leading companies to respond to the increased risk with high premiums and strict limits on eligibility, he said. Younger would-be buyers are put off by the failure of the policies to protect beneficiaries against inflation, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. Private insurers so far have sold about 1 million long-term care policies _ most of them in the past two years _ providing limited coverage to less than 2 percent of the age 50-and-up population, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said. While the market is likely to expand dramatically and policies gradually are getting better, `` inherent limitations will put a stop to the growth of the long-term care market long before private insurance can offer real protection for most people,'' he wrote. The October issue of Consumer Reports magazine includes a survey of 24 long-term care plans, and concludes that many companies have improved their policies by eliminating some coverage restrictions. The magazine said other companies, however, are denying policyholders benefits by digging up problems in their medical histories only after a claim is filed. Ball predicted pressure for a better and broader solution will grow along with public concern about the rising cost of long-term care _ the bill for one year in a nursing home averaged $ 25,000 in 1988 _ and the limits of current government coverage. `` It's not just a matter of the elderly wanting more protection for themselves,'' he said. `` Those who are really at risk most are middle-aged people either needing to bring their parents into their homes to care for them or facing very high expenses for nursing home care.'' <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> served as Social Security commissioner from 1962-1973, played a key role in the 1983 reform of Social Security and was the chief administrator of <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> for its first seven years. He now chairs the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit group that promotes research and education about Social Security and related programs.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said today continued <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will be a priority issue when he meets later this week with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. `` We're a little disappointed in what's going on down there,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, referring to the role of the Soviets and other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries in building up the Sandinista military arsenal. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told a news conference that most of the Soviet weaponry arrives in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> via third countries. He added that the Soviets could put a stop to the practice if they so chose. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, that the increased flow of Soviet bloc arms to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> indicates `` not a very kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke after the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Soviet bloc weapons deliveries to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> have continued at a rate of more than one a week this year, despite a cease-fire dating back 18 months. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pledged early this year to cut off weapons deliveries to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION>. But administration officials, insisting on anonymity, said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons were spotted last week being loaded onto a Nicaraguan vessel at a port in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The equipment has since been delivered to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The officials declined comment on a published report that the weapons consisted of three torpedo-carrying boats and four Mi-24 Hind helicopters. The leak of that sensitive information seemed calculated to influence the upcoming meeting Friday and Saturday between <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. One purpose of the meeting is to lay the groundwork for a summit meeting between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that Soviet bloc deliveries to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for the first eight months of this year totaled about $ 350 million. The equipment weighed an estimated 12,000 tons and was delivered during 41 ship visits to Nicaraguan ports, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that the value of such shipments during all of 1988 was $ 515 million. Earlier Monday, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> expressed irritation that overall deliveries to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> appear to have increased this year compared with a similar period in 1988. Officials had expected a decline since the Sandinista government and the Nicaraguan resistance reached agreement on a truce in March 1988. Although there have been some violations of the truce, the level of fighting is down sharply from 1987. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the level of Soviet bloc shipments is well beyond the legitimate defense needs of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` It is inexplainable to us why the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> feels that it must provide <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> with even more weapons while a cease-fire is in effect than it provided the Nicaraguans when they were actively engaged with Contra forces,'' she said. `` The basic pattern in recent years has been transshipment of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` This year, the weapons out of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has increased dramatically.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continue to supply arms to the leftist <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> has come to rely chiefly on Soviet bloc weapons,'' she said, adding that such activity defies agreements signed by Central American presidents which call for an end to outside support for insurgencies in the region.

 The warm waters of the tropics generate almost daily clouds and showers, a few of which, for reasons not well understood, grow into some of nature's largest and most dangerous storms. These are storms like Hurricane Hugo, which forecasters say may hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> later this week after battering many <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>; like the cyclones that have killed thousands in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, and like the typhoons that recently took hundreds of lives in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. To meteorologists, these are all tropical cyclones, giant whirling areas of low pressure, winds churning counter-clockwise around the center and drawing strength from the warm water beneath. Why do some low pressure areas peter out and others turn into mighty storms? `` Nobody knows for sure,'' admits meteorologist <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. But while <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> says much more study is needed, he was able, in a telephone interview, to describe how these storms strengthen, live and die. Like tornadoes and the mid-latitude storms than often generate blizzards in winter, hurricanes are basically regions of low pressure, the result of rising air. But tornadoes, powerful and dangerous as they are, are tiny compared to hurricanes. A tornado is local, forming from an individual cloud in 20 minutes to half an hour, <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> observed. Hurricanes cover thousands of square miles and take five to six days to form. The sun warms the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, concentrating its strength near the equator. The resultant heated air expands and rises, creating a ring of low pressure and rain around the globe known as the intertropical convergence zone. Hurricanes form to the north and south of this zone, but due to the same sort of heating, <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> explained. The sun warms the water, some of which evaporates to wet this warm rising air, he pointed out. This creates a region of hot, wet air 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the ocean. The warm, moist air rises as it cools, with the water eventually condensing into clouds that form tropical showers and storms. But at this point a new factor is added: condensing water releases more heat into the air, just as humidity condensing on a cold glass in summer warms it up. So the rising air is warmed again, and that's the `` kicker'' for the storm, said <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON>. It spurs on the formation of clouds by increasing the lift of the air, drawing in more moisture from below to provide additional fuel. At the same time, <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> explained, the clouds begin to turn, taking some of the Earth's spin as their own, creating the counter-clockwise turning of the storm. This is known as the Coriolis effect, turning the storms counter-clockwise north of the equator, the opposite way to the south. It does n't happen at the equator, but gains strength away from that line. As the winds get closer to the center of the storm they move faster, just as an ice skater spins faster when she pulls her arms closer to her body. For reasons not well understood, a clear eye forms in the middle of the storm as it gains strength, <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> commented. Air in this central region is descending, and as a result remains clear, in contrast to the wall of clouds in the spinning, rising air around it. As long as the warm, wet air from tropical oceans is available, it fuels the storm engine, <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> explained, providing rising moisture that condenses, releasing more heat to drive the fury onward. The storms move little on their own, however, he added. Rather, general winds and upper air currents pull them along, first to the west into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and then turning north to collide with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or follow along the East coast. The track depends on many things, including the location of the powerful jet stream thousands of feet above the earth. That movement is what leads to the death of the storms, <PERSON> Bleck </PERSON> went on, cutting off their fuel supply either by moving them over land or over cooler ocean waters where there is less evaporation to provide them a supply of water. Either way, they then lose strength and break down into a loose mass of storms, still dangerous but without the power of the churning hurricane circulation.

 They met in a tattoo parlor and the next night she accused him of raping her. Then she hired a lawyer for him and posted his bail, and now they plan to get married. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> now blames pills given to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> the night of the May 24 attack. `` It was n't him,'' Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. `` I've talked to people who know him. And I know him now and he's not the kind of person who would do that. It was a drug-induced stupor the way he acted that night.'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsini </PERSON> moved Monday to dismiss charges in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, because Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> would not testify. `` I think he's using her,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marsini </PERSON> said Tuesday. Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, 25, testified in June that she protested when she was `` pinned down'' and raped by Farmer, 31. But on Monday, she said she plans to marry him Sept. 30 in a civil ceremony. `` My mother is not opposed to our marriage. Both of my parents, deep down, love <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> a lot. And I get along very well with his parents and his two children,'' she said. `` Both <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> and I have a lot in common,'' she said. `` We're both from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and we both were born in February. While rape and related offenses were withdrawn, Farmer did plead guilty to stealing a diamond ring from Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> and was placed on two years' probation. Defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> hired him June 3 to represent Farmer, two days after Farmer's preliminary hearing on the rape charges. `` She posted bail for him and paid his legal fees. It's the first time I've ever had a victim pay my fee,'' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said she met Farmer May 23 at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> tattoo parlor, where she had gone with a friend, and set up a date the next night. `` I have green eyes and he convinced me to get a tattoo on my shoulder of a green eye with a tear,'' Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. During the June 1 preliminary hearing, Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> testified that Farmer `` violated me.'' `` I was scared to death. I could n't move,'' she testified, saying he pinned her down. `` I was too scared to scream,'' she said during that hearing. But Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said she and <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> have lived together since she posted his bail after she found out her roommate had given him `` pills that caused the attack.'' Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said she also received a call from Farmer's ex-wife, who said rape was out of character for him. `` Immediately, I started to cry. I went with her the next day to the jail. When <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> came out he was so shocked. He sat down. He took my two hands. He did n't remember anything that happened that night. He held my hand and said: ` If I did this to you, I deserve to die.''' <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said Farmer is undergoing drug rehabilitation. Ms. <PERSON> Marsini </PERSON> said the drug Farmer is said to have taken the night of the alleged attack is a painkiller that toxicologists told her is a depressant that would not cause a violent reaction. `` She's recanted her testimony. She said she created the situation and caused the problem,'' she said. `` She said he is a victim of circumstances. `` He's playing on her sensitivity. She's very vulnerable.'' Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> discounted that evaluation. `` That's her job to say that. But that's not the case,'' Ms. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said. She said that when the charges were dismissed Monday, <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> had a smile `` as big as the sky.'' `` He said, ` I feel like I have 100 pounds off of my shoulder, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>. It's over. We can finally have a life.'''

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday they would wait a day before deciding whether to move the space shuttle Atlantis off its launch pad, where it could be threatened by Hurricane Hugo. Space agency officials also put off a decision on whether to remove a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite from an Atlas-Centaur rocket on another launch pad.

Given the unpredictability of hurricanes, `` that's not assured,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had begun preparations to move Atlantis into an assembly building if it appears that the storm might endanger the craft, he said. The preparations included disconnecting fuel and electrical lines from <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> and moving a giant tracked vehicle into place to carry the spaceplane to the assembly building. The giant tractor, called a crawler, moves at a maximum speed of 1 mph and would take at least six hours to cover the 4.2 miles to the building. The Atlantis mission is scheduled for Oct. 12, when a team of five astronauts is to deploy the $ 1.4 billion <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft for its trip to the planet Jupiter. However, the launch could be delayed if Atlantis is moved. Preparations also were made to remove the $ 65 million communications satellite from atop the Atlas-Centaur, including draining the rocket's fuel tanks. Officials said the rocket should be able to ride out <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> if the storm struck here. The Atlas-Centaur launch had been scheduled for Friday, but has been delayed until at least Sunday because of the need to drain the fuel tanks.

 The Kremlin's top human rights official took issue Tuesday with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> definition of Soviet emigres as refugees, saying it creates `` friction'' in superpower relations at a time when his government is allowing record numbers of citizens to leave. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanitarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and Cultural Relations at the Soviet foreign ministry, was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> preparatory to the meeting later this week between Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> said the agenda, at the request of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side, would include discussion of the cases of several hundred Soviet Jews denied permission to emigrate. The two sides will also discuss exchange programs for psychiatrists and law enforcement officers, he said. In an unusual appearance before the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> promised that Soviet Jews would be allowed to practice their religion freely or leave the country if they want. New draft laws on freedom of religion and on emigration seek to `` create the best possibilities for those who want to live in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. ... But for those who, for some reason, are unhappy and want to leave, the best civilized conditions should be created,'' he said. In the first eight months of the year, 127,000 Soviets were allowed to emigrate, he said, about a third of whom came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as refugees whose expenses were paid by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Speaking to reporters after his speech, <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> criticized the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of classifying the Soviet emigres as refugees, saying it runs `` contrary to the definition of refugee'' accepted by the international community. `` Calling these people refugees creates a considerable, additional friction'' in U.S.-Soviet relations. `` We are trying to do our best to solve the situation but then ... we're -LRB- portrayed as -RRB- some enemy of mankind from whom all the people are fleeing. It's not a good thing,'' <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> said. Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, addressing the conference before <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON>, defended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to allot 50,000 of the 125,000 worldwide refugee slots in fiscal year 1990 to Soviet emigres. Despite the unprecedented surge of Soviets allowed to emigrate, and the recent improvement in the lives of those staying behind, there are still hundreds denied permission to leave and a wave of anti-Semitism has surfaced as a result of the glasnost policies of free expression, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said. `` Given the history'' of hundreds of years of officially sanctioned anti-Semitism, `` tens of thousands of Soviet Jews are turning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said. `` What Soviet Jews are looking for now is a plcae where they can be themselves. They are not economic migrants.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` a victim of our success'' now that the Soviets have acceded to years of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands to allow free emigration, he said. Unfortunately, budget constraints place a limit on the number of Soviets the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can absorb and other countries, such as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, should share the burden, he added. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> promised that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would bring up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about anti-Semitism in his meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and would press for enactment of legislation that will institutionalize the reforms. Once such laws are adopted, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will lift certain trade restrictions on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is `` lobbying'' the Supreme Soviet, which is the Soviet legislature, to consider the draft laws as soon as possible and at least one may be taken up at the coming session starting Sept. 25. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had anticipated the new laws would have been enacted already, but <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> said the Supreme Soviet has other items higher on its agenda. The Soviet official said that even without the laws, the number of people denied emigration dropped from 11,000 several years ago to 2,000, the teaching of Hebrew and Yiddish is allowed in schools, and three million Bibles were recently imported into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reshetov </PERSON> promised that all violators of the ban on anti-Semitic activity would be punished. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says that despite the official outlawing of discrimination against Jews, anti-Semitism among the lower echelons of the bureacracy and among the general population has increased.

 A judge ordered <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to provide $ 7.56 million to restore services that had been cut or canceled for more than 4,000 mentally retarded people living at home in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Arguing that cuts in the service had put the retarded people at risk of institutionalization, <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> Court Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crumlish </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> directed the city to restore the program and said the state must pay 90 percent of the costs. He gave the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> until Sept. 27 to ask the Legislature to provide the money. `` The crying needs of and imminent harm to the individuals at issue here, unable to speak themselves, can not be ignored while the intricacies of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> budgetary process unfold,'' <PERSON> Crumlish </PERSON> said. The services involved teaching and training the retarded in basic life and social skills, such as feeding and dressing themselves and learning a simple job. The ruling applied only to retarded people in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The ruling affected only those persons who had received the rehabilitative services before they were cut July 1. But attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferleger </PERSON> said he hoped that the state recognizes it must also provide such services for every retarded person who requests them. `` It is a great victory, not only in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, but for retarded persons everywhere in this country,'' said <PERSON> Ferleger </PERSON>, who was representing retarded people awaiting services. `` Other states, I'm sure, will begin to provide these services as <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> now is required to do.'' The lawsuit, brought by the city and joined by the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and Fire Association for Handicapped Children, was the second the state has lost over the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> program. During the last fiscal year, unhappy with deficits in the program, the Legislature tried to withhold the appropriation, acquiescing only under court order. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Smink </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state welfare department, said no decision on an appeal has been made. <PERSON> Crumlish </PERSON> said the state had continually refused to provide sufficient funds in recent years. `` This chancellor is deeply troubled by the department's utter disregard of the needs of mentally retarded persons and their families who depend on non-residential serevices and programs,'' he said. <PERSON> Crumlish </PERSON> said that while the state was at fault, the city also was to blame for failing to prevent the cutoff of the program by seeking additional funds from federal or private sources.

<HEAD>Life Sentence of Secret Police Chief Commuted in Haiti</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The president has commuted the life sentence of <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Desir </PERSON>, the former secret police chief who directed hundreds of torture sessions during the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regime, a state-run newspaper said Tuesday. Human rights activist <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajeux </PERSON> immediately denounced the move, saying: `` The commutation is a gesture of conciliation toward the Duvalierists. The next step is a full pardon.'' `` <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Desir </PERSON>, the man who directed torture sessions with a Bible in his hand, is a symbol of Duvalierist barbarity,'' <PERSON> Bajeux </PERSON> said in an interview. L'Union newspaper carried an <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement saying that on the first anniversary of his rise to power on Sept. 17, 1988, the president, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, pardoned or commuted the sentences of 13 people. They included <PERSON> Desir </PERSON>, who was sentenced to life at hard labor after the fall of dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> in 1986. <PERSON> Desir </PERSON>'s sentence was commuted to 30 years in prison, the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said `` The president of the republic has the prerogative to commute a sentence. If he so wishes, he may even grant full pardon,'' <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernizan </PERSON>, the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Port-au-Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kernizan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Desir </PERSON>'s trial had been irregular and that he was `` a victim of social pressure.'' <PERSON> Kernizan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Desir </PERSON>'s `` victims could not testify against him, since most of them are dead.'' One of the few people to be sentenced for crimes committed under the dictatorship, <PERSON> Desir </PERSON> directed innumerable torture sessions and executions when he headed the dreaded secret police of <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>'s father. The number of his victims is not known, but they are estimated in the hundreds. In the 1970s <PERSON> Desir </PERSON> fell out of favor with <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> and was forced into retirement. He was captured while trying to flee the country on Feb. 25, 1988. An airport employee alerted a local radio station of his flight, and thousands of Haitians swarmed the landing strip to prevent his departure. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was elected president in 1957 following a year of political turmoil during which six different governments held power. He became president-for-life in 1964 and wielded absolute political control until his death in 1971, when his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> `` Baby Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, assumed the presidency. On Feb. 7, 1986, after months of civil disorder, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> led the military junta that assumed power when <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled. Presidential elections on Nov. 29, 1987, were aborted after thugs, protected by soldiers, massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations. Civilian <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> won army-run elections on Jan. 17, 1988, and was overthrown by <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> on June 20, 1988. On Sept. 17, 1988, a military coup brought <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to power. In April 1989, loyalist troops foiled a coup attempt and crushed a rebellion by two army units. <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> comprises the western third of the island of Hispaniola in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, between <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said today he hoped to conclude a chemical weapons agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> this weekend and make headway on other arms control fronts. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in his first <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference in eight months in his job, sought to reverse growing criticism in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere of the cautious approach President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is taking in response to foreign policy initiatives from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He accused the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s Democratic leader of playing politics with the issue. Last week, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who will meet with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, on Friday and Saturday, accused the administration of `` timidity'' on arms control issues. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said Monday that the administration had failed to encourage change in the Eastern bloc and was `` feeling almost nostalgic about the Cold War.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> replied today: `` The president is rocking along with a 70 percent approval rating in foreign policy. And if I were the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader I might have something like that to say, too.'' And yet, in several of his replies to questions, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> stressed the cautious stance taken by the administration toward Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be maintained. `` I hope we have been approaching this relationship with a proper degree of prudence,'' he said. In this regard, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> lowered expectations that he would set a date with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> for a summit meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He said only that the subject would be thoroughly discussed at Jackson Hole. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said any increases in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which are veering away from a Marxist economy, depended on the changes undertaken in the two East European countries. `` We should n't be mistaken'' and think <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid could overcome their problems, he said. And, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, it was the Soviets' `` turn to move'' on reducing troops and non-nuclear armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. On negotiating arms control with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` we have to be careful not to become frantic ...'' However, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he would propose to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> ways to break a 15-year impasse on verifying the size of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet underground nuclear tests. In addition, he said, `` We have, I think, a reasonable shot at an agreement to exchange data on chemical stocks, which I think is a first practical step toward achieving real controls and eventually a total ban.'' On another arms control front, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the administration no longer would seek a ban on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range mobile missiles. He urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide funds for development of the single-warhead Midgetman. The move is of limited significance. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had taken the position it favored a ban only if the elimination of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet mobile missiles could be verified, and no headway was made on the issue in negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said continued <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> weapons shipments to leftist <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will be a priority issue in his discussions with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` We're a little disappointed in what's going on down there,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, referring to the role of the Soviets and other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries in building up the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' military arsenal. He said most of the Soviet weaponry arrives in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> via third countries and the Soviets could put a stop to the practice if they so chose.

 A survey of sheep ranchers shows that flocks are less likely to be attacked by coyotes, wild dogs and other predators if a burly guard dog is on watch, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that scientists began studying guard dogs 10 years ago at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sheep Experiment Station in <LOCATION> Dubois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` At that time, the dogs were considered a novelty,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a wildlife biologist at the station, said in a report by the agency. `` Livestock producers who had guard dogs were thought to be foolish, brave, desperate or a combination of all three. Today, much of the skepticism is gone.'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and his colleagues sent out 1,000 questionnaires to ranchers and farmers who rely on the dogs to safeguard sheep, cattle and goats. More than 80 percent of the 399 who responded said a guard dog was well worth its initial cost of about $ 500, plus the dollar or two a day it takes to feed them, Green reported. The dogs weight 100 to 120 pounds and come from several breeds _ <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pyerenees </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Komondor </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Akbash </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Anatolian </ORGANIZATION>. Green estimates that over the last decade as many as 8,000 of the guard dogs have been used on 4,000 ranches throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

 A state appeals court today stripped <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup and gave the trophy back to the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s Appellate Division reversed a lower court ruling April 7 that stripped <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> of yacht racing's most coveted prize for using a catamaran, or two-hull vessel, instead of a single-hull boat in winning a 1988 match. The appeals court said that the catamaran was legal and that the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> is entitled to the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> had ruled in April that the best-of-three race between the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, a yacht about 90 feet at the water line sailed by the <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, and the Stars and Stripes, a 60-foot catamaran sailed by the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> group, was a `` gross mismatch'' and unfair. <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> found that competing vessels must be `` somewhat evenly matched'' in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup competition and that using a lighter, faster catamaran violated the spirit of the international competition. But in its 4-1 decision today the appeals court said <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> had on her own pronounced a rule that is neither expressed nor implied in the Deed of Gift, the 102-year-old document that governs the race. The squabbling began in July 1987 when <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, ignored modern <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup tradition and demanded a one-on-one match with a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> defender. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> wanted the race held within one year rather than the usual three to four; he wanted a one-on-one race instead of the usual elimination matches, and he wanted to compete in a boat more than 90 feet long at the water line instead of the usual yachts that are about 45 feet at the water line. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> rejected the challenge, but <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> went to court. When <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> was ordered to accept the challenge, it also went to an unconventional boat, the speedy catamaran. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> became trustee of the Cup in 1987 after skipper <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> sailed the 12-meter yacht <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes to victory over the Australian defender, <PERSON> Kookaburra </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in waters off <LOCATION> Fremantle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The victory returned the Cup to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>'s 1983 loss to the Australians ended a 132-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winning streak.

<TEXT>
 The widely publicized flood of East German refugees to the West has energized the fledgling pro-democracy movement they left behind, giving it a new boldness to challenge <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s hard-line government Just two weeks after its creation, a dissident group called Neues Forum says its numbers have swelled from 30 founders to more than 1,500 supporters nationwide. Neues Forum says it has also received inquiries from a number of low-level <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and on Tuesday asked the government to legalize it. `` For too long, people have only dared to express their hopes in places like bars, where it's safe. It's time we start talking about these things out in the open,'' said 27-year-old <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>, a group member who asked that his last name not be used because of possible police reprisals. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s hard-line Communist government staunchly rejects the kinds of reforms under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, saying there is no need for them in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Neues Forum, which means New Forum, is demanding that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s rulers heed the call for reforms and that the group be legalized by the government. `` We want to keep whatever has been proven, but at the same time create room for renewal,'' says the group's founding charter. At one founding member's <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> apartment, the telephone rang frequently as people called seeking information about Neues Forum. Several East Berliners knocked on the door with the same request. `` The response has far exceeded our expectations,'' said <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrich </PERSON>, another founding member of Neues Forum who was kicked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year for criticizing the government. Other new pro-democracy groups are springing up as well, with a meeting of activists from across <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> tentatively planned for sometime next month. It's not clear how many people belong to such groups and how many have expressed interest. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Tuesday quoted East Berlin Lutheran Rev. <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppelmann </PERSON> as saying in an interview that there are `` about 500 pro-democracy church groups with memberships ranging from 10 to 100.'' The Citizens' Movement for Democracy Now was founded last week by 12 people, including <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> pastors, scientists and human rights activists. The group says it now has a few hundred members. Another pro-reform group, <ORGANIZATION> Liste </ORGANIZATION> 2, was recently founded in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. Neues Forum says the exodus of thousands of East Germans to the West should be a signal to Communist authorities that something must be done soon about widespread discontent and despair among East German citizens. `` People who contact us say they have faced the question whether to also leave, or stay and try to get something done,'' one of the group's founders, East German artist <PERSON> Baerbel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON>, said on West German <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television Monday. Among those making contact with Neues Forum are disillusioned <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, the group's leaders say. It is believed there is a growing desire among lower party echelons for political and economic reforms but that people at the top refuse to listen. `` People contact us saying they have directed a -LRB- state-owned -RRB- business for 20 years and have ideas for economic changes. They say that for a long time they have made suggestions to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but there was simply no reply,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON> was not interviewed by ARD. Instead, <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> filmed her while she was talking on the telephone with a reporter calling from a West German radio station. <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> said it was not permitted by state authorities to interview Ms. <PERSON> Bohley </PERSON> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Neues Forum on Tuesday submitted official applications to Communist authorities in districts across <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> seeking to be legalized. The group's chances for official approval do not look promising. About 100 activists, including Neues Forum members, were arrested after a prayer service at <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> church on Monday night. They included <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> coordinator for Neues Forum. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> and the others were released the next afternoon. But activists say they will keep up their efforts for change whether Neues Forum is legalized or not, saying the only alternative for East Germans is continued frustration and despair. <PERSON> Henrich </PERSON>, one of the Neues Forum founders, told a gathering of activists in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Monday night that a congress of all pro-democracy groups is planned for sometime next month to `` formulate common goals.'' `` Everyone agrees on one thing. Things can not go on as they are in the German Democratic Republic -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said. Nearly 17,000 people have fled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Sept. 10, when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> defied its hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally and orchestrated a mass migration to the West by East Germans vacationing in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pa. Lawmaker Unveils Pro-Choice Abortion Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID MORRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A coalition of pro-choice lawmakers Tuesday proposed legislation designed to strengthen women's rights to abortion in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and to preempt a planned attempt to toughen existing laws restricting abortion. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is widely viewed as a key battleground state following the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision in July that gave states more leeway in addressing the abortion issue. Historically, the state <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has overwhelmingly approved bills restricting abortions, but many of the provisions have been struck down in court. The new nine-bill package includes measures calling for a state constitutional amendment giving women the right to an abortion, restoring state-subsidized funding for all `` medically necessary'' abortions, and wiping out an existing law requiring rape and incest victims to file a police report before receiving subsidized abortions. The centerpiece bill, sponsored by state Rep. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, says government should not interfere with `` a woman's personal choice to commence, prevent or continue a pregnancy or have an abortion'' before the fetus is viable. The proposal mirrors existing law in saying an abortion on a viable fetus is allowed only if the mother's life or health is threatened by the pregnancy. Under the proposal, a fetus is considered viable if the woman's doctor rules there is `` a reasonable likelihood of sustained survival ... outside the woman's uterus. In an attempt to placate some abortion opponents, Ms. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said the bill would also require doctors to ask teen-age patients to notify at least one parent before having an abortion. If that is not feasible, the doctor must recommend that the teen-ager discuss the matter with another relative, school counselor or another adult. `` This bill represents mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the opinion of an overwhelming majority of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> citizens as well, that government has no business invading the privacy of people's lives,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said at a news conference. The bills are scheduled to be introduced simultaneously in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 2. Abortion foes, led by state Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, are scheduled to introduce legislation outlining further restrictions on Oct. 3. This is the first attempt in several years to offer an organized pro-choice package of bills. Ms. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> and others acknowledged the proposals would face tough opposition in both chambers, but she said the public generally supports a woman's right to an abortion, even though many legislators do not. Freind said the parental notification in Ms. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>'s bill weakens what already is in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law but is under court challenge. The law now requires that a parent be notified or the minor obtain a court order before having an abortion. He also said pro-choice advocates want to restore the pre-1985 situation of `` tax-funded birth control by abortion on demand. That wo n't happen.'' Legislation enacted in the early 1980s and upheld by the courts after years of legal battles restricted Medicaid funding for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when the mother's life was at stake Abortion already is an issue in the 1990 governor's race. Likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON> is pro-choice. Incumbent Democrat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> opposes abortion. Freind has said his bills will deal with such issues as requiring spousal notification before an abortion is performed and banning so-called sex-selection abortions. He said he did n't regard the pro-choice announcement as an attempt to upstage his efforts. `` Nobody takes us out of our game plan,'' he said. `` This is one more battle that has to be won ... It's one more battle that will be won and take us one step closer to the day when the sanctity of all human life is protected in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Study: AIDS Patients Take Risks by Combining Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS patients in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> are taking an average of five drugs and unapproved treatments without telling their doctors, posing a risk of potentially fatal drug interactions, a survey has found. One patient admitted using 25 treatments, said Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. She described her findings Tuesday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a significant minority who have a background belief that new experimental drugs may have more benefit than drugs already available,'' she said. The hidden use of AIDS drugs also makes it difficult for scientists to determine which drugs have toxic side effects. Patients receiving only the recommended, approved treatments for infection with the AIDS virus or HIV would normally not be receiving more than one or two drugs unless they were very sick. Then they might be given up to five drugs, <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunnigan </PERSON>, medical director of a city-supported AIDS clinic in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said he was a bit surprised at how many drugs patients were taking, but said he was `` fully supportive of people with HIV using alternative therapies.'' `` I also believe care is difficult if we only have bits and pieces of information'' about what patients are taking, <PERSON> Dunnigan </PERSON> said. He is on the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> group studying alternative treatments. <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON>'s survey found that 37 percent of the patients were getting prescriptions from a second doctor and 28 percent were using treatments not approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The use of FDA-unapproved treatments was common and increased with the severity of illness,'' <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said. The only government-approved drug to treat AIDS is AZT. Several other drugs are available for the treatment of AIDS-related infections. The alternative treatments most widely used by patients in the survey included megadoses of vitamin C and the unapproved AIDS drugs AL721 and dextran sulfate. One patient was getting injections of fetal sheep blood. Other doctors familiar with the survey were surprised at how many drugs patients were getting from other doctors and alternative sources, such as community-organized trials of unapproved drugs. AIDS patients have more toxic drug reactions than do other patients, <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said. Because of the clandestine use of multiple drugs, `` it can be hard to sort out which medications are causing these toxicities,'' she said. The hidden use of approved and unapproved AIDS drugs is complicating scientific research, because subjects in the studies are not disclosing their use of other drugs, <PERSON> Dunnigan </PERSON> said. In some cases, disclosing that use might result in their being dropped from the study, losing access to medical care associated with the study, he said. `` There are two sides,'' he said. `` From the physician's point of view, in order to get good data there needs to be some rigor in how the drugs are used. But from a client's point of view, there's so little that can be done. And the clock keeps ticking.'' <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said patients who use unapproved treatments are not discharged from her clinic, but are advised to tell their doctors what drugs they are taking. `` I do n't think you can ask people to not take something they think will help them,'' <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said. `` That's my personal opinion. But you can ask them to let you know.'' The key to avoiding problems is a partnership between doctors and their patients, <PERSON> Dunnigan </PERSON> said, in which patients feel free to disclose which drugs they're taking. `` Hopefully that agreement would be made before therapy is initiated,'' he said. The survey, which began last fall and will continue for two more years, consists of 30-minute to 60-minute interviews with each patient every three months. Patients are asked about their use of various medical services in addition to drug use, <PERSON> Greenblatt </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Will Request to Have House Leveled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman's dying wish to leave behind an unimpeded view of the shore by having her house leveled was denied Tuesday by a judge who called the will request a waste of money. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Needham </PERSON> threw out a portion of <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s will that instructed the city of <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> to raze the old home and use the property as a right of way to <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` To destroy the house would be to commit substantial waste of this estate,'' <PERSON> Needham </PERSON> said. `` I declare the provision is void as being contrary to public policy.'' <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trust </LOCATION>, executor of the woman's estate, did not want the nine-room home razed and challenged the will in June, when <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments from lawyers. In 1973, the <LOCATION> Victorian-Queen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anne </LOCATION> home built in the 1890s was made a national historic site, along with the rest of the neighborhood. Neighbors and the city also opposed leveling the house and filling in the basement as requested in the will. Ms. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> died in April 1986 at age 86. The will left $ 5,000 to the city to maintain the right of way. The <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> leads to <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Needham </PERSON> said the area would not be served by tearing down the house, among $ 1.4 million in assets left by the woman. Her wealth was mostly in stocks and bonds. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer, said the ruling `` made a lot of sense.'' He added: `` No one wants to see a nice house destroyed. But on the other hand, some people -LRB- would feel -RRB- you ought to be able to do whatever you want in the will.'' <LOCATION> Needham </LOCATION> ruled the home should be sold. He said an appeal of his decision is unlikely. The exact value of the house is unknown, but real estate agents said waterfront homes in the area were selling for $ 400,000 and more.

 Two drug addicts from the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have been admitted to a donated treatment program in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> that could be a model for programs elsewhere in the nation, government and private drug abuse officials announced Tuesday. `` This effort has brought a cooperative spirit to the district that could well be recreated in communities across the nation,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON>, deputy director for demand reduction in the Office of National Drug Control Policy. `` We need everybody to follow this example of private and public cooperation to win this war.'' The two unidentified adult men, who left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last Wednesday to be admitted to a facility of the <ORGANIZATION> Bradford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, are the first of 70 that the private drug and alcohol treatment organization has said it will accept in the first year of its new program. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, a company operated for profit, has had a policy of making unused beds available to uninsured addicts in the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> area and announced on May 23 that it would extend the program to the nation's capital. Patients for the treatment slots are selected by a committee of private citizens working under auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, executive director of the council, said the patients must be residents of the district, must have a `` significant person'' to help them with decisions, must have no criminal charges pending against them although they may have criminal records, must certify that no insurance company or third party will pay for the cost and must not have been through a drug treatment program before. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said there is a `` considerable waiting list,'' although he said he did not know the number waiting. <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Burson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION>, said most patients would stay from 30 to 45 days. After that, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, they are to receive two years of follow-up treatment in the district, which they agree to pay for through some form of community service. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the council is negotiating with three treatment groups in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburbs that have approached it about similar programs.

 A man accused of killing his girlfriend, then dismembering and boiling some of her remains, calmly told investigators where to find a bucket filled with her body parts, detectives said Tuesday. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON>, 28, awaited arraignment later Tuesday on a charge of murdering Swiss dancer <PERSON> Monika </PERSON> <PERSON> Beerle </PERSON>, said police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, a department spokesman. The victim's remains, reduced to a skull and bones left in a five-gallon bucket, were found in the baggage claim of the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> bus terminal and handed over to the medical examiner. No findings were expected before Wednesday. Miss Beerle, 26, came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, to study with the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> and took up residence in east <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON>, a short-order cook who drifted from job to job, moved in with Miss Beerle about two months ago and they shared the apartment with another woman, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenrich </PERSON>, commander of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> detectives. He declined to say where the other woman was or what she saw. When Miss <PERSON> Beerle </PERSON> decided to break off with <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON> and told him to leave on Aug. 19, <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON> beat and stabbed her to death, then worked for the next week at disposing of the body, <PERSON> Fenrich </PERSON> said. He boiled the parts to separate flesh from bone and `` flushed the skin down the toilet,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. Word of the grisly killing got around the neighborhood and eventually reached police, <PERSON> Fenrich </PERSON> said. One of <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON>'s neighbors said <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON> had bragged that he would kill his girlfriend. `` He said, ` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> has nothing on me,''' said the neighbor, who asked not to be identified. <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON> was arrested Monday at a restaurant in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> where he had been working for two days. `` He was calm, not excited, did n't appear to be under stress, did not offer any resistance and came voluntarily,'' <PERSON> Fenrich </PERSON> said. `` His statement led us to the baggage check-in.'' <PERSON> Rakowitz </PERSON> has a prior conviction for selling marijuana, <PERSON> Fenrich </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Tuesday won an opportunity to revamp the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> by scheduling a party congress next year that could hasten the pace of economic reforms and change the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also made an emotional plea for calm among ethnic groups in the increasingly restive <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> and Baltic republics. `` We can not allow anarchy, much less bloodshed,'' he said on state television. He also condemned secessionist movements in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, saying people demanding independence are `` demagogues.'' `` Currently, the work of party bodies and organizations is in many ways fettered by old structures and outdated rules and instructions,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the party's 251-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in obtaining its approval for moving up the date of the party meeting to October 1990. The congress, with 5,000 delegates, theoretically is the party's most powerful body It can set broad policy guidelines, and it is the only body that can promote Communists to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which makes major decisions in the five years between congresses. Historically, the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> also sets the five-year plan for the economy. By party rules, the next congress _ the 28th in the party's history _ must be held by early 1991 Moving up the date will allow <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to make economic reforms sooner and to increase the number of supporters on the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The move came at a closed meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> dedicated to solving the nation's ethnic disputes, which have led to more than 200 deaths in the past 19 months and threaten Soviet stability and unity. In remarks later shown on state television, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said nationalist disputes must be resolved peacefully. He rejected demands for boundary changes between the country's 15 republics. He said such changes can not solve conflicts when 60 million people, or almost one-fifth of the Soviet population of 285 million, live outside their native territories. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also used the speech to denounce critics on both the right and left who assail his reform campaign, known as `` perestroika'' or restructuring. `` They are telling us that we ca n't solve the country's problems without moving to capitalism,'' he said. `` Another theme, coming from the right, is that everything we suggest, the policy of perestroika, is an action the West succeeded in planting, in forcing on us. That's rubbish!'' The last party congress was held in February 1986, less than a year after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power. He succeeded in replacing 41 percent of the voting members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Appointees of former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, however, remained a significant force. In April, another 83 of the then 301 voting members resigned, and a number of candidate members were promoted to full membership, entitling them to vote on issues brought before the body. The congress agenda approved Tuesday includes a report on the progress of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic, social and political reforms, a review of party rules and the election of new governing bodies _ presumably including the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> itself and the 12-member Politburo. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, 58, expressed concern that the party is lagging behind the political reforms he has set in motion, including the shift of more power to elected government bodies. `` Real life, the reconstruction forces are going at such a rhythm that we often can not catch up with them,'' he said. `` We can not leave things as they are, especially since fundamental economic and social processes are unfolding and an ideological and political struggle is under way over key problems of social development,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Some party stalwarts have said they fear the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, enshrined by the constitution as the country's `` leading force,'' is losing its grip on political power as the legislature grows stronger and frustrated citizens sometimes take matters into their own hands. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said the party must adopt a new program and rules. A new program was adopted at the last <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, replacing a Khrushchev-era document that had served for more than 20 years. Ethnic disputes in many Soviet republics have disrupted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to reform society. On the eve of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> activists appealed to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to order an end to what they call an economic blockade imposed on their <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> republic by neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Tuesday that two policeman were killed by a mob a day earlier in an Azerbaijani village on a blocked road to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mostly Armenian enclave of the republic. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> has claimed the region. In <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, a weekend `` Friendship Carnival'' degenerated into mob violence that included a sexual assault on a girl in the subway and the siege of an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> building, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, Communist officials have joined in varying degrees with informal political movements that demand sovereignty from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Democrats Propose $1.8 Billion Aid Package for Poland, Hungary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, contending the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is `` missing the boat'' on the surging reform movements in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, on Tuesday proposed a $ 1.8 billion aid package that would dwarf the assistance offered by the White House. Accusing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of timidity and a `` failure of leadership,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the Democrats' three-year proposal would be addressed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday with the aim of getting it before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., called the proposal `` a gamble for freedom'' and said it would help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new non-communist government build a free economic market and democratic institutions The aid package would authorize $ 423 million in the 1990 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and $ 381 million in each of the next two years. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> initially proposed a one-time $ 100 million aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and last week proposed an additional $ 50 million in food assistance. The centerpiece of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal is the establishment of a $ 300 million-a-year `` enterprise fund'' over the next three years to support free enterprise economic development in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The plan also would authorize spending $ 75 million in each of the next three years to establish a similar fund for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said the proposal calls for skimming the money from the $ 40 billion spent by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> each year for research and development. The bill, which combines elements of the administration's aid proposals with proposals by congressional Democrats, has these other major elements: _ Authorizes the extension of <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> guarantees to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses investing in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> _ Authorizes the extension of trade preference benefits to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ Authorizes $ 11 million in scientific and education exchanges along with medical assistance and help in building democratic institutions for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> _ Authorizes $ 25 million to help modernize <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s telecommunications _ Authorizes $ 3 million for <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> activities in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> _ Directs the president to encourage debt for equity swaps and debt rescheduling negotiations to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> deal with its massive foreign debt _ Authorizes the president to pursue other initiatives, including a possible airlift of food to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` We need a substantive economic commitment of enduring support for free market mechanisms and democratic institutions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a commitment on the scope and duration of the Marshall Plan'' which helped <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> rebuild after World War II, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. `` I am convinced it is in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interest to help these struggling nations move away from the failed policies of the past, and to move to a brighter future under pluralism, democracy and free markets,'' he said. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said it would be `` tragic for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be excessively cautious, for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to mistake the status quo for stability.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal came one day after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, called the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> niggardly and urged the president to quickly `` go beyond symbolic nods and meager gestures.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> organized its biggest domestic relief effort in four years and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> dispatched ships and planes Tuesday to bring emergency assistance to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> victims of Hurricane Hugo. Relief workers gathered blankets, cots, food, medicine and other supplies for shipment to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth where about 27,000 people were reported homeless in the wake of the storm. `` We're working with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, trying to get our supplies on their planes,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruberry </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The problem right now, of course, is that the airports are closed, and even when they reopen we do n't know what size planes they'll be able to accommodate.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's lead agency for disaster relief, launched a C-141 cargo plane loaded with government relief workers and communications gear from <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, bound for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> reported damage to 90 percent of the buildings Coast Guard C-130s from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, headed to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, with emergency supplies, while two <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters assisted with communications and relief efforts. `` We do n't know the extent of the mobilization that's going to be required,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` That's essentially what we know at this point Our radio communications have been virtually nonexistent across the island since the storm went across.'' Five Red Cross supply centers across the nation organized relief shipments in hopes that <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> flights would be able to launch soon from bases in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` We are sending cots, blankets and comfort kits _ those contain soap, toothbrushes, shampoo and other toiletries _ to a staging area in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ruberry </PERSON> said. `` We're sending in all 15,000 of each of these items.'' About 400 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> took care of about 25,000 people Monday night _ offering food, shelter and medical attention, he said. The ferocious storm produced a groundswell of public support, especially in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Puerto Rican community, the largest on the mainland with an estimated 1.5 million people. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benevolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a weekend benefit concert featuring pop star <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, and television and radio stations planned marathon fund-raisers. Collections of clothing, food and donations are planned Saturday at two major intersections in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the Rev. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and executive director of the association. Community support was `` heavy, heavy, heavy,'' he said. `` I just got a call from the Boy Scouts. They're offering 25 kids to help on Saturday. We will have vehicles from our organization to go pick up everything,'' <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> said. He said he was in touch through newly restored telephone service with mayors in several <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> cities to relay messages from nervous relatives. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the government tourist office for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> was flooded with calls from people who could n't reach relatives at home, but regional manager <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said she has n't been able to reach anyone either. `` We're in the same boat,'' she said. `` I do have all of my relatives down there, and I have n't been able to get through.'' A two-member disaster response team from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> fire department, a specialized unit that routinely travels to some of the world's worst disasters, had traveled to <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> on Saturday in preparation for the storm. The pair set up a communications center in <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION> on Tuesday, paying particular attention to the island of <LOCATION> Montserrat </LOCATION>. `` An airplane that flew over showed that just about everything was down. There were no standing structures. They feel they've lost everything,'' said <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Montes </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Special Prosecutor Wants Attorney General's Appeal Powers Limited</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The attorney general should not be empowered to appeal a judge's secrecy order in trials being conducted by independent counsels, <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contra </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, appointed an independent counsel in 1986 to investigate the Iran-Contra affair, urged the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> legislative affairs subcommittee against adopting legislation to specifically give the attorney general such power under the Classified Information Procedures Act. The independent counsel, speaking to reporters after the closed hearing, noted that the attorney general already has the power to file a court affidavit blocking a trial if he feels disclosure of certain secrets in open court would endanger national security. But <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who was forced to jettison three major conspiracy charges against former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> because of the government's refusal to release certain classified information, said the attorney general should not be allowed to appeal trial-court rulings on secrecy in cases conducted by special prosecutors. To do so would undermine the independence of special prosecutors, said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. `` If the attorney general feels that a case should be interrupted to protect classified information, that should be a clean-cut act which the public can understand and for which he takes political responsiblity,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in an allusion to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s response to secrecy problems arising from his prosecution of a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent. `` He's not in there to tinker with it. And he should not come in unless he wants to kill the case,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. In a report to the committee released after the hearing, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> pointedly noted that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> threatened to file an affidavit preventing disclosure of secrets in the trial of former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>. As jury selection was set to begin on July 24, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> instead sought a stay of the trial while he appealed the judge's ruling that the details of three <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> programs in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and the locations of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> stations in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could be disclosed in court. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> is now considering whether the attorney general has right to appeal such a ruling. The appellate court has stayed the trial of <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, accused of lying about his role in setting up a clandestine arms resupply network for the Nicaraguan Contras. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> also urged the panel to adopt legislation requiring the attorney general to notify the intelligence committees of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so those panels `` would be able to look at the so-called secret information to see whether it's a true secret.'' `` The basic controversy is as to matters which are classified but which are publicly known,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` There are some matters, which even though the public knows it, the intelligence agencies wish to keep classified, and not release even for use at trial, even though it may mean that the trial has to be dropped,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. Before the trial of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, who was convicted of three Iran-Contra coverup charges, intelligence agencies objected to the identification of countries that helped arm the Nicaraguan Contras. Similar secrecy problems have arisen in the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case, even though some of the same secrets were disclosed in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that the intelligence agencies are apparently concerned that `` in the framework of the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case, it might get into much more nitty-gritty detail.'' `` While I recognize these problems, but to defeat a case ... to protect that rather abstract concern, seems to me going too far,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McHugh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the subcommittee chairman, said the panel may draft some legislation but first wants to hear testimony from <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, whom he said has refused so far to discuss the issue.

<HEAD>Production, Use Down 16th Straight Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cigarette production is declining this year and so is the average smoking rate among Americans _ for the 16th consecutive year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Total output is expected to drop from last year's 695 billion cigarettes because of higher prices, health concerns and smoking restrictions, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in its report. Cigarette use may drop about 3.5 percent from last year's average of 3,096 cigarettes, or fewer than 155 packs of 20 each, the report said. The average is for all Americans 18 years and older, smokers and non-smokers alike. It is a statistical comparison only and does not indicate the actual smoking habits of the population. Cigarette smoking peaked in 1963 at an average of 4,345 _ more than 217 packs _ before beginning its longtime downward trend. Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco production this year is up about 9 percent from 1988, mostly because of an increased acreage, the report said. `` Even with the larger crop and the continuing decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette consumption, flue-cured -LRB- the most abundant type of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco -RRB- auction prices are higher than a year ago,'' the report said. `` The higher prices result from tightening supplies because of reduced carry-in -LRB- old inventories -RRB-, a relatively good quality crop, and higher price supports.'' Analysts said that prospects for world tobacco use next season indicated `` a small increase in sales and use of cigarettes and unmanufactured tobacco.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports of unmanufactured tobacco leaf `` may rise a little'' from last season.

 Iran-Contra prosecutors made `` an irreparable mistake'' by failing to get <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> permission before launching a perjury probe of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, his lawyer said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was raising a significant legal issue, but rejected as too time-consuming an attempt to delay the trial so that an appeals court panel could issue an advisory opinion. `` We're looking at about a year'' if such a course were pursued, said the judge. At a hearing Tuesday, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, said all nine criminal counts pertaining to <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s congressional tstimony should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said near the end of the court hearing that, `` this case is going to go to trial, I think.'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, the retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general enlisted by <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> to run arms to the Contras and assist in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> initiative, is accused of obstructing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, perjury and making false statements. His trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 13. The government says <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> lied when he denied taking money out of the companies he and Iranian-born businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> used in the Iran-Contra initiative. Prosecutors allege <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> took over a million dollars in profits. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> argued that independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was required under the Ethics in Government Act to get an expanded mandate from the attorney general before launching the probe of <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s 1987 testimony to the Iran-Contra committees of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> was appointed in December 1986 and `` I think the independent counsel made an irreparable mistake in not going back to the attorney general'' seeking to expand the investigative mandate before delving into <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s congressional testimony, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. Associate independent counsel <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said the intent of the appeals court panel appointing the Iran-Contra prosecutor was to allow wide latitude in the investigation. `` It's hard to imagine a broader grant of jurisdiction,'' <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON> said of the appeals court panel's mandate. The court on Dec. 19, 1986, appointed <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to look into alleged crimes in the Iran-Contra affair committed `` in or about 1984 down to the present.'' It also authorized the independent counsel to prosecute any other alleged crime committed by North or others when the allegations are `` connected with or arising out of'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> also is accused of three counts of conspiring, offering and paying illegal gratuities to North. In a recent interview on the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> program `` The Reporters,'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> said he has suffered financially due to the Iran-Contra scandal. `` We're about as close to being broke as you can come,'' <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> of his family. He said he had to pull two of his children out of college because `` we just could n't continue to support that.'' Asked in the TV interview about his allegedly having pulled in more than a million dollars in profits from the Iran-Contra scandal, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> responded: `` If I had done that I would n't be in the financial bind now ... It's just pure myth.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was convicted of driving while intoxicated in suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, his second drunken driving conviction since May. He is appealing both convictions.

<TEXT>
 Fighting back tears, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> woman whose jaw was destroyed by a drug user's shotgun a decade ago told senators Tuesday the nation needs strong death penalty laws. `` The problem I see with the death penalty is the lengthy appeals process,'' <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> of <PERSON> Pawley </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is considering measures to increase the number of crimes that could result in death sentences under federal law. Senators commended Mrs. <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> for bravery in telling the story of the Feb. 22, 1979, murder spree by two men that left four dead. She and a fellow worker at a convenience store were taken to a deserted road, raped and shotgunned, she testified. Her assailant, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON>, left her for dead, Mrs. <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. Actually, she turned her head at the moment of the shotgun blast, which blew away part of her mouth and her jaw. Despite her wound, she was able find help, but her co-worker died in the incident. The two assailants were found the same night in a <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> motel. One of them, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaar </PERSON>, committed suicide. <PERSON> Woomer </PERSON> was captured, convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He has been on death row ever since as the appeals process has continued. Mrs. <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said she has been helped by reconstructive surgery and psychiatric care, but added that it `` is hard to get up in the morning and look in the mirror.'' `` It's hard when little kids stare at you and adults try not to. Its hard to smile when you know how you look when you do.'' She was asked by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, a sponsor of the death penalty legislation, if she considered life in prison sufficient punishment even for those who commit heinous crimes. `` I believe the terrible crimes he committed do warrant the death sentence,'' she said. `` He did not give the four other people the option of life or death.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> state Solicitor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anders </PERSON> testified that the two killers were `` drugged up'' on PCP and alcohol. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as part of last year's anti-drug legislation approved capital punishment for drug kingpins whose racketeering activities result in death. A 1972 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, however, blocked use of a number of death penalty provisions on the books at that time, calling unconstitutional the discretion the law allowed juries and judges on whether to impose death or not. At the hearing, Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> told senators that under current law a jury can impose the death penalty for the murder of a Drug Enforcement agent investigating a case but not for the murder of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent responding to a bank robbery. Legislation before the committee would restore the death penalty for murdering a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the Cabinet or the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to espionage. It would extend capital punishment provisions to murdering foreign officials and official guests, kidnapping resulting in death, attempted presidential assassination, murder for hire and murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise.

 Coastal dwellers from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> nervously watched the progress of Hurricane Hugo on Tuesday, hoping it would spin harmlessly out to sea but fearing the worst. `` We've just been inundated with calls about preparedness,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, who coordinates emergency operations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, one of the places considered most vulnerable to the storm. Forecasters at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> said it was too early to tell whether <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> might turn toward the northwest and take aim at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland or veer eastward and churn out into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` It is definitely a potential threat. People in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be monitoring this storm,'' said meteorologist <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> at the Hurricane Center. `` Any time you have a hurricane with winds of 105 mph or more possibly coming ashore in the beachfront areas, you have the potential for a great deal of damage.'' If it does assault the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION>, possibly as early as Friday, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> could land anywhere from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, forecasters said, with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> getting votes as the most likely target. Hurricane Center director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON> said he expects to issue a hurricane watch Wednesday from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> likely to feel the hurricane's effects in two to three days. `` Hopefully, we'll be able to narrow that somewhat tomorrow,'' Sheets said. Emergency officials up and down the coast began making plans for the hurricane, although most said it was too early to take any defensive action. `` Right now, we're just watching the storm,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` Tomorrow, we'll be having a meeting with the shelter managers, school superintendants and others to review the procedures. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Willcox </PERSON> said all emergency workers had been placed on standby alert and officials were contacting volunteers to make sure they are prepared to help out in a disaster. And in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials fretted about the space shuttle Atlantis, sitting on its pad at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> in preparation for an October launch. Space agency officials decided to wait until Wednesday before deciding whether to pull the spacecraft back into the safety of its hangar _ a tedious procedure that could delay its flight. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> ordered food and made last-minute preparations to open 58 shelters in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and 23 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, and several radio stations in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> planned to activate storm tracking hotlines to keep residents up to date. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> disaster worker <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said he was `` assuming the worst and hoping for the best.'' Farther north, officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> said they were just keeping track of the storm and hoping their states were n't on its itinerary For those in charge of emergency agencies, preparations for a hurricane can include stocking schools and evacuation centers with food, notifying residents of evacuation plans and shoring up vulnerable structures. Preprations for individual coastal residents are much the same. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, said anyone in <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s path should stock up on non-perishable food, flashlight batteries and drinking water, and should make sure their car has plenty of gas. Boat-owners should bring their vessels ashore if possible, and residents closest to the water _ especially those in mobile homes _ should be ready to evacuate. Pet owners need to find places for their animals, which usually are n't allowed at evacuation shelters. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> had warnings for the socially minded and the adventurous. He said those in the hurricane's path should n't plan hurricane parties, and no one should venture outside if they are in the eye of a hurricane.

If I were to have a woman prostitute in my employ for my own self gratification, I'd be run out of town,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said At <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s own request, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee is investigating his involvement with <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s disputed claim that the congressman was aware he was operating a prostitution service out of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> apartment <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has said he would await the ethics committee's inquiry. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, answering questions at a news conference, said he was `` distressed to have anything of that nature become a stain up on the House of Representatives.'' Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, in a breakfast meeting with reporters, acknowledged <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was under pressure to resign but said the congressman was right to await the ethics committee inquiry. `` He's done what he should have done,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` The ethics committee ought to go forward. Pressure is building to resign. But we ought to let the quasi-judicial process go forward.'' Asked if <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had become an embarrassment to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said: `` No, do n't think so. There have been issues like this for years in poitics. But I think we should let the quasi-judicial process take over, and then we can make some recommendations.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, meanwhile, sought to carry out normal congressional duties while declining to discuss his case with reporters. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> attended a morning subcommittee meeting without speaking publicly. He had normal office appointments in the afternoon, said his administrative assistant, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s accuser, breathed fresh life into the story by recounting his version of their relationship in the airing Tuesday of a videotaped appearance on the television program, `` <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON>.'' House Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> also cited the ethics comittee when asked about <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. `` I do n't think we should try people outside of that process,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, D-Mo., said Close political allies of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> contended he is not weighing an immediate resignation, despite the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s editorial call for his resignation and private suggestions from political sources that he was considering such a move. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said over the weekend he would step aside if he decided his case was hurting the liberal causes he has worked for. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s sister and a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> political consultant, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was wrestling with the question of whether he might not seek re-election because of diminished effectiveness, but would not resign before the ethics committee probe was carried out. A <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ally of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON>, described the continuing disclosures about <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> as `` like Chinese -LRB- water -RRB- torture,'' but defended <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s decision to await the ethics committee review. `` Some people may resign and cut their losses, but I think it's up to the individual member who's being charged,'' <PERSON> Moakley </PERSON> said `` This may very well be the thing <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is remembered for in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It's like when -LRB- former <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> had his tryst with the dancer and ended up in the tidal basin.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s long-time media consultant in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> did not intend to resign before the ethics committee acts and reacted angrily to growing speculation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> political circles about <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s fate. `` There's no way <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>'s going to let this end without getting his day in the ethics committee,'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said. `` I think it would be a mistake to resign because the political kibitzing industry says he should,'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said. `` It's really sick, almost, that people are now engaged in trying to provide the definitive wisecrack about <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s support within his district remains strong. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has become the focus of intense media coverage of his personal life, including his current long-term relationship with a male friend. In a reaction to the intensity of coverage, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has declined press interviews about his case this week _ although he conducted several last week. Reaction to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s case has been divided within <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s homosexual community, although <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s decision to reveal his sexual preference two years ago made him a visible symbol of a politically successful gay person who has acknowledged his homosexuality The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Blade, a gay newspaper in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, last week published two letters from writers who said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> should resign, including one writer who said `` he owes all gays an apology for his stupidity.''

 The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday the first 25 American movie classics to be placed on the new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registry </ORGANIZATION> as `` culturally, historically or esthetically significant'' treasures in the art form of filmmaking. The list was heavy with popular, Academy Award-winning titles, from `` The Best Years of Our Lives'' to `` The Wizard of Oz.'' It included one documentary, `` Nanook of the North'' and one contemporary hit, 1977's `` Star Wars.'' Librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> said the selections do n't constitute a list of the best American movies, but most are easily recognizable among moviegoers' all-time favorites. The 25, listed alphabetically: `` The Best Years of Our Lives,'' 1946; `` Casablanca,'' 1942; `` Citizen Kane,'' 1941; `` The Crowd,'' 1928; `` Dr. <PERSON> Strangelove </PERSON>; or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,'' 1964; `` The General,'' 1927; `` Gone With the Wind,'' 1939; `` The Grapes of Wrath,'' 1940; `` High Noon,'' 1952; `` Intolerance,'' 1916; `` The Learning Tree,'' 1969, and `` The Maltese Falcon,'' 1941. Also, `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' 1939; `` Modern Times,'' 1936; `` Nanook of the North,'' 1922; `` On the Waterfront,'' 1954; `` The Searchers,'' 1956; `` Singin' in the Rain,'' 1952; `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' 1937; `` Some Like it Hot,'' 1959; `` Star Wars,'' 1977; `` Sunrise,'' 1927; `` <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>,'' 1950; `` Vertigo,'' 1958, and `` The Wizard of Oz,'' 1939. <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> sought to defuse an almost certain controversy among film critics and scholars over the selections. `` Make no mistake, this list of 25 films is not a list of the best 25 American films,'' he said. `` Film critics and scholars could not agree on such a list, and the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not embark on any such futile exercise. This is not Academy Awards night.'' Rather, he said, the list `` should suggest to the American public the breadth of great American filmmaking'' under guidelines set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. No films less than 10 years old were eligible, and there was only one issued in the past 20. The registry was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year as part of the National Film Preservation Act, which called for naming 25 outstanding movies to the registry at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> annually for three years. The legislation was prompted partly by the recent boom in coloring of black and white films, a practice loudly protested by moviemakers. The law does not prevent coloring, but any film listed in the National Film Registry must carry a warning label if it has been colorized or `` materially altered'' in versions produced for video cassettes, television broadcast or other showings. Three directors whose films were chosen, <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Donen </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should halt colorization. `` They should take the next step, to protect those films from all kinds of distortion _ speeding up, colorization and all the other things that have been done to them _ and leave them the way we made them,'' <PERSON> Kazan </PERSON> said. `` That is what they can do to really show how they honor our films.'' Seven of the winning films are owned by broadcasting magnate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who is a champion of film colorization. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehr </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said that the movies chosen made up `` a very safe, conservative list'' but that he wished they `` had been a little more reflective of bread-and-butter Hollywood.'' Each film added to the government's version of a movie hall of fame will bear a seal designating it `` as an enduring part of our national cultural heritage.'' The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will obtain a high-quality print of the original version of the movie for its collection of more than 75,000 film and television titles dating to the 19th century. <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> said half of all movies made before 1950 and 80 percent of those made before 1930 have been lost forever, because of the deterioration of early nitrate film into powder and because of sloppy cuts and editing of films for videotapes and TV broadcasts. `` The cold, hard fact is that for all their popularity in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today, films are an endangered species for the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> said. The list is the result of a lengthy process involving nominations of nearly 1,000 movie titles by mail from the general public. The list was narrowed substantially by the 13 members of the new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> which met in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in July. <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> made the final selection of the 25 top films and indicated Tuesday that he personally made at least one addition to the list, which he refused to identify. He said there was no overwhelming, all-time favorite nominated by the public or chosen by the panel of experts. The board included representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, movie and TV producers and film scholars. <PERSON> Billington </PERSON> said his goals in selecting the outstanding films were to help promote movies as an indigenous <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art form and generate public interest in preserving films.

 A housing organization on Tuesday said the problems plaguing the Department of Housing and Urban Development should not be used as an excuse to dismantle federal programs necessary to meet the nation's housing needs. The investigation of mismanagement and abuse at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> is no reason to delay maintainance and development of much-needed housing, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` The highest priority of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should be immediate action to address the critical need for additional low - and moderate-income housing,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said at a news conference `` The need to investigate should not be an excuse for inaction in meeting the nation's housing needs.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said that with nine months past since the start of the current congressional session and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, `` it's time to move on ... the housing crisis is getting much worse. More than 500,000 federally subsidized rental housing units could be lost in the next 15 years due to federal inaction or weakened national financial conditions, he said. The National Housing Conference represents more than 1,000 public and private builders, developers, planners, architects, housing financiers and tenant groups. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said current estimates of the homeless population range from 700,000 to 4 million, but an additional 4 million to 14 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families are `` doubled up and tripled up in apartments of friends and family.'' `` Even a mild recession could double homelessness in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> virtually overnight,'' he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said current budget requests for housing are inadequate, with an additional $ 13 billion to $ 18 billion needed for federally assisted housing programs and $ 21.5 billion required to repair dilapidated public housing stock. Another $ 10 billion should be included for new housing construction, he said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he believed Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> `` has not gotten the support of the administration'' for funding existing housing programs. Instead of using $ 50 million from the operating subsidies of public housing administrations to fight drugs in public housing, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> should have been given a separate allocation, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, one private mortgage insurer announced it would help low - and moderate-income families purchase almost 10,000 homes in the next year by insuring $ 500 million in loans through the a new program Under the Community Home Buyer's Program, prospective homebuyers would be allowed to purchase a home with lower down payment and less savings on hand and using a higher portion of their income for housing expenses than traditional loans require. The cornerstone of the program, developed by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, is a home-buying and mortgage credit course including pre - and post-loan-closing sessions for borrowers

 A federal judge Tuesday refused to stop the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> from testing for steroids and declined to reinstate 13 players suspended under the program. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said `` the clear congressional policy against judicial interference in labor disputes'' poses a `` formidable obstacle'' to the players association's request to block the program with a preliminary injunction. The players' labor union, which says steroid testing is unreliable, asked the court to suspend the league's program while it is pending before an arbitrator. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said the record in the case `` simply does not present the kind of irreparable harm'' to the players that would be required to issue an injunction. The <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> suspended 13 players for 30 days after another federal judge on Aug. 28 refused to issue a temporary restraining order against the league. The players association asked <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to restore the suspended players to active status and to order the league to refrain from any further suspensions on the basis of steroid testing until the arbitrator rules. The labor union also sought to enjoin the league from further testing for steroids.

 Heavy rain fell along the central <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, with more than 2 inches in some areas, and Hurricane Hugo roared through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> moved toward the northwest at 12 mph, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 105 mph. It seemed to be threatening the coast somewhere from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, but meteorologists could not predict its wobbly path. It lurched to the north and west because other weather systems seemed to be blocking it from heading into the open <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Behind Hugo, Tropical Storm Iris approached hurricane strength with maximum sustained wind speed near 70 mph. It was located northeast of the northern <LOCATION> Leeward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. A low pressure area off northeastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> moved northeastward, spreading moisture from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> across the mid <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> region. A small stream and urban flood watch was issued for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> sections of the metropolitan <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where 1.5 to 3 inches of rain was reported and where an additional 2 inches was possible during the night. Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included 2.40 inches at <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, Md.; 2.15 at <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>, Del.; 1.93 at <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; 1.63 at <LOCATION> Millville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; 1.34 at <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del.; and 1.31 at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>.

 Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic primate of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said Tuesday the Carmelite convent near <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> may be moved, but he complained that Jewish protests had `` touched the dignity'' of the nuns. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> said he had not seen a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announcement Tuesday saying the convent should be moved away from the former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp and that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would help pay to build a new prayer center outside <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. But when reporters described the announcement, he said it sounded like a `` forceful resolution of the problem, and I do n't think that would be a very positive way.'' He said that by `` forceful'' he meant `` an administrative enforcement of the transfer of the sisters, not their own expressed wish.'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, who was on a 24-hour visit to consecrate a Polish church in this southwestern city, said that building a prayer center away from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp would be a `` great step, we hope, in order to solve this problem.'' `` I do think there is a possibility that the nuns could be moved elsewhere,'' added <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>. `` But if they were to be moved this should be done with charity because ... that would be also crossing out their rights.'' <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>'s remarks were in line with recent hints he has softened his position on the convent, which many Jews regard as an offensive intrusion. At least 2.5 million Jews were among the 4 million people murdered by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> at the World War II death camp. The nuns were supposed to move to a prayer center away from the camp by Feb. 22 under a 1987 agreement between four European cardinals and an international Jewish delegation. But the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> balked at honoring the accord and the deadline passed with no sign of a center or any move to relocate the nuns. The cardinal, at the center of the dispute which has split the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and revived charges of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, spent most of a 40-minute news conference defending his position. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> had canceled plans to travel from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of threats of Jewish protests. `` The great Jewish protests which developed around the problem of the Carmelite nuns in <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> were very sad because they touched the dignity ... of the women who devote their lives to God,'' said <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>. He spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated into English by a fellow priest. <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> discussed plans for the prayer center last week with <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissenbaum </PERSON>, a German-Jewish financier who runs a philanthropic trust that restores Jewish memorials and who has offered assistance. Previously, he said, the prayer center was just `` wishful thinking.'' He did not say when construction might start, nor did he say explicitly that the nuns would move once the building was complete. During the news conference, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> called repeatedly for Catholic-Jewish dialogue over the convent dispute. He also acknowledged there was anti-Semitism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but he said Poles could not accept that <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> was a purely Jewish memorial, because many Christians also died there. During the summer, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> suggested repeatedly he wanted the convent, established in 1984, to remain and called the accord offensive. <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> have said the church should honor the 1987 agreement. The controversy grew after seven Jewish protesters, led by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> rabbi, tried to climb a fence surrounding the convent and were forced back by Polish workers in July. In remarks that increased Jewish anger, <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> suggested afterward that the protesters meant to attack the nuns and said that Jews had the media `` easily at your disposal in many countries.''

 The number of East Germans seeking refuge in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> swelled to more than 600 on Tuesday, leading <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to close its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> embassy to the public. Hungarian news media reported for the first time Tuesday that Czechoslovak authorities were preventing emigres from reaching <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. A Czechoslovak government official denied the allegation. The reports followed refugee complaints recently of East German and Czechoslovak harassment. The refugees say authorities are trying to keep them from entering <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, they can cross freely to neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> under special measures adopted by Hungarian authorities eight days ago. Refugees inside the West German Embassy grounds in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> said they now numbered 500, with 300 having climbed over the six-foot fence surrounding the compound the past few days. An additional 120 East Germans, also seeking guarantees of safe passage to the West, are in the embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it was closing its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> embassy to the public until further notice, saying the situation had become untenable. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoeller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, told the West German TV network ARD that 104 East Germans were inside the embassy and 16 more were outside. He did not spell out what he meant by `` outside'' the embassy. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials previously spoke of 110 refugees in the compound. <PERSON> Schoeller </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has promised a pragmatic solution.'' Asked if he meant sending the refugees to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, he replied, `` I do n't see it that way yet. We must wait.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrobog </PERSON>, said the Polish citizens seeking visas for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could obtain them at travel agencies. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had already closed to the public its embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and the diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after hundreds of East Germans started seeking refuge in the buildings last month. The <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> embassy reopened to the public after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> agreed to open its borders to the East Germans seeking passage to the West. West German border officials reported 700 refugees arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> over the last 24 hours, raising to nearly 17,000 the number of East Germans who have come to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its borders Sept. 11. Hungarian radio said the numbers of East Germans seeking refuge in the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> embassy probably increased because `` Czechoslovak authorities are turning East Germans back, that is preventing them from going to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> although they have valid travel documents authorizing them to travel there.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Prague </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Tuesday denied that. `` <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> honors all international covenants. No problems in rail or car transportation are made for East Germans traveling to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with valid documents,'' <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulhanek </PERSON> said. `` All statements implying the opposite are untrue.'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, sandwiched between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, is the most direct route for East Germans traveling to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, an official of a West German charity organization handling East German refugees in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said 100 East Germans who had crossed the border illegally from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> arrived at his camp Tuesday. Before <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its borders, thousands had crossed illegally over stretches of the country's Western border that have been cleared of barbed wire as part of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s more liberal political and economic policies. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that criminal proceedings had been started against nine border guards charged with smuggling East Germans across the Austrian border. It quoted the military prosecutor's office in the west Hungarian town of <LOCATION> Gyoer </LOCATION> as saying the guards had, in exchange for `` significant sums,'' helped East Germans clear the border during a period following Aug. 20, 1989 before <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> allowed East Germans to legally cross into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Five men have been taken into custody, and the other four have been taken off border patrol duty, can not carry out armed service and are not allowed to leave the military compound until the issue is clarified, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper stepped up its harsh criticism of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Tuesday, accusing it of `` slave trade'' in allegedly encouraging the exodus of East Germans to the West.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division is seeking transcripts of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee's hearings on allegations of influence peddling at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said Tuesday. However, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, said he was unsatisfied with the move, and he continued to say he may call for a special prosecutor in the case. Justice spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the criminal division had asked for the transcripts of hearings being conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee. Earlier this year, prosecutors in the department's public integrity section made a preliminary conclusion that the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's report on influence peddling in the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program, a main focus of the congressional investigation, showed no instances of criminal wrongdoing. The subcommittee has heard testimony that politically connected developers received approval from high-level <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials in the award of government housing grants. So far, the department has been reviewing newspaper accounts of the hearings, at which a series of witnesses have described lobbying of high <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials on behalf of development firms, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The subcommittee has also heard conflicting testimony about the role of former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the awarding of grants. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has been called back for more questioning about whether, despite his repeated denials, he helped political friends get <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants. The subcommittee is expected to vote Wednesday to subpoena <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who last week abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance. The former secretary's lawyers said they needed more time to prepare for the questioning. The panel's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., has expressed the view that other witnesses had `` put the lie'' to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s denials that he ever helped prominent Republicans get <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> backing for housing <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> has said he wants to give <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> an opportunity to clarify testimony that has been contradicted by other witnesses. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> rejected a call by Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., for a special prosecutor in the matter `` Investigations are proceeding in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices around the country and there is no reason to believe these can not be handled by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` has made it clear he wants these cases given high priority,'' the spokesman added, referring to investigations of fraud of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs. As for <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>'s statement of the request for hearing transcripts, <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., said, `` That's not comforting This should have been done a long time ago. It just raises questions in my mind about the veracity of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation.'' He said that because of allegations concerning dealings with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> around the country, it is important that any criminal investigation be centralized in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and not be conducted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys around the nation. He said unless there is a centralized investigation that looks at the principal former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials involved, including <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, `` then I just totally feel we've got to take it away from <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and have a special prosecutor. Right now, I just do n't know. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has n't had much communication with committee members.'' `` I can assure you that the records of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee are being reviewed closely as a part of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> matter,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said at a morning briefing. Later in the day, however, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> acknowledged that the department had not yet received any subcommittee records but would be asking formally for the transcripts of the hearings. `` That letter is going up today or tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Soviet Immigrant Who Staged Hunger Strike Becomes U.S. Citizen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The ceremony lasted only a few minutes Tuesday, but for Soviet immigrant <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, the journey to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship took years. Eight years ago, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> staged a hunger strike for 26 days in his homeland to attract the attention of Soviet authorities, who ignored his plea to join his American wife. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, his wife did the same. After a year of bureaucratic haggling, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>'s name was added to the list of Soviet citizens with a spouse in the West who was allowed to leave in 1982. Years later, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, dressed in a three-piece gray suit, stood outside a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> courtroom ready to fulfill his dream of citizenship. `` It's a great day,'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> said while waiting for the ceremony. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> has been working as a translator for a Russian-language newspaper in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> since March, when he left his position at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>. He is also translating his play about life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, `` Strangers Do n't Enter,'' into English, and hopes one day to have it produced. `` I expected life would be hard here because I did not know English well and I could n't use my education here. It's getting better,'' he said. A shy, soft-spoken man, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> worked as a taxi driver, furniture mover and bookstore clerk before he began teaching Russian to soldiers at the institute in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> is a pretty small town, and there is a small community of Russian instructors,'' he said. `` Sometimes it looks like the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But it is better to be among Americans.'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, 58, joined 150 others for the naturalization ceremony Tuesday. He stood stiffly, with a stern look on his face. Afterward, he pulled a voter registration form out of his pocket and proudly proclaimed his intention to register _ probably as a Democrat. Asked how he felt, he said simply, `` Great.'' <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>'s journey began with a fascination with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. A journalist in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he read American literature and watched movies in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> theaters. Friends teased him, calling him an `` Americaniste.'' Then he met <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, an American student working on a dissertation at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>. Nine months later, they married. When <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>'s visa expired, she was forced to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> without her husband when she was unable to find work. It was the beginning of the couple's yearlong struggle against what became a bureaucratic nightmare. Then, for reasons that remain unknown, Soviet authorities allowed <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> to leave, and he and <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> were reunited. The transition was not easy; they separated in 1985 and later divorced. <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> worked at a string of subsistence-level jobs after he arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He recalls the early days in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, when a trip to the supermarket could overwhelm him. Living alone in a rundown house in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> would rise early to practice English, watch television to further improve his conversational skills, and then set off for work in a bookstore. He studied at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> three nights a week, and would walk the streets at any hour to satisfy his wanderlust. Although his life in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has been filled with challenges, <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON> said he has no regrets about leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I still feel some kind of pain. I do n't want even to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.''

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> had recently received a shipment of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> arms and defended his nation's right to arm itself. The opposition newsaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, in its Monday editions, quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites had observed the arms shipment. `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has normal relations with several countries which have supply us with arms,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> when asked about the matter. When reminded that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to suspend arms sales to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said, `` Yes, but these are replacements. Arms that have to be replaced. If a helicopter is damaged, it must be repaired or replaced with another.'' He added, `` We maintain the same level of arms to guarantee defense.

<TEXT>
 The national AIDS commission, concerned that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug strategy makes too little mention of AIDS, on Tuesday agreed to draft a statement calling for treatment of drug addicts in preventing spread of AIDS. The statement will reaffirm the previous AIDS commission's call for drug treatment on demand as a national goal, said <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, chairwoman of the new panel. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said the statement will be `` carefully worded'' so it does not appear antagonistic, but she added that the panel `` can be aggressive ... without being adversarial.'' `` We want to say something that's a firm reminder in a collegial sort of way,'' said <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, after she adjourned a two-day meeting of the panel The previous AIDS commission, formed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and chaired by Admiral <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, now secretary of energy, highlighted the need for expanded drug treatment capacity to stop spread of AIDS through sharing of needles by drug users. The new AIDS panel, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year but not fully constituted until this summer, will not recommend a specific amount of funds for drug treatment, but its statement will show that commissioners `` share the priority judgment of the <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> commission,'' <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said. Commissioner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarlais </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state coordinator for AIDS research, estimated that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan would deliver about a third of what the <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> commission said would be needed to treat all drug addicts. The commission, anticipating maneuvering in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for mandatory AIDS testing and tracing of sexual partners, also agreed to a resolution calling on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to block attempts to add AIDS-policy amendments to appropriations bills. This method of attaching `` riders'' to appropriations bills is often used to win approval of measures that could not be approved in the normal legislative process. <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON> said that based on `` past patterns of behavior and rumors,'' commissioners expect that the parliamentary tactic will be attempted again this year as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completes action on spending bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. `` We would like to be sure that AIDS policy is taken very seriously,'' she said.

 A judge Tuesday delayed the use of videotaped testimony from former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> in the libel trial of journalist <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, who is accused of defaming a former Indian prime minister. <PERSON> Moraji </PERSON> <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, who was Indian prime minister from 1977 to 1979, filed a civil libel lawsuit against <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, claiming he was libeled in <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>'s 1983 book, `` The Price of Power,'' about <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> served as a paid <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> informant. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Norgle </PERSON> called an early recess Tuesday after <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>'s lawyers said they would object to <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s attorneys showing the jury a one-hour taped deposition by <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> Lawyers were to present arguments on the admissibility of <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s taped testimony on Wednesday. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> is scheduled to deliver a speech in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and might be subpoenaed to testify if the judge bars the use of the taped testimony, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Omeara </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s attorneys <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s lawsuit was filed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in accordance with the tradition of filing defamation actions in the hometown of the defendant. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but now lives in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Omeara </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s testimony could be instrumental to the case. `` It says that, to the best of his knowledge, -LRB- <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> -RRB- could n't be the spy,'' <PERSON> Omeara </PERSON> said, after Tuesday's court session. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>'s lawyers have indicated that they consider <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>'s testimony to be invalid and based on hearsay Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s lawyers finished showing excerpts from 81 hours of videotaped depositions made by <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> during visits to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1984-85. <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, 94, was too ill to travel from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to testify in the trial, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Cyriac </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappil </PERSON>. In his deposition, <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> said he met with President <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at least twice in 1968 and with <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> once in 1969 in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but said he could not recall what they spoke about. In excerpts shown Monday, <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> said he had met with top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, but insisted that he did not reveal any secret information. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, said Monday that the author had six independent sources who claimed <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, a bitter enemy of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, received $ 20,000 a year as a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> informant. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said the Indian politician cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> because he was opposed to Ms. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s close relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and her preparations for the 1971 war with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> libel law, <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s attorneys must convince jurors that <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> knowingly printed false, negligent or malicious material. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970 for his articles exposing the My <PERSON> Lai </PERSON> massacre in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> when he was a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 The battleship <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> fired its 16-inch guns on Tuesday, the second battleship to do so since 47 sailors were killed in an April explosion aboard the USS Iowa. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> fired its weapons successfully off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. The ship's nine guns in three turrets each fired three times, resulting in 27 successful rounds. The firing was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> Commander, Adm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He said the firing of the guns was approved after the ship had completed an `` extensive review'' of its ordnance certification and training procedures, as called for following the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the April 19 explosion in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s No. 2 turret. The investigation was unable to pinpoint a cause but did cite gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, captain of the middle gun, as the `` most likely'' person to have caused the disaster. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> first test-fired the 16-inch guns in its No. 1 and No. 3 turrets on Aug. 4 while deployed in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. All Iowa-clas ships were prohibited from firing their guns immediately after the explosion, but that decision was modified in June to allow for `` live-fire training ... to prepare for contingency operations as directed by fleet commanders,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has four battleship of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> class. Each of the guns can fire projectiles weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a maximum range of 23 miles.

He identified <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Namou </PERSON>, 37, as a city employee from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aaiun </LOCATION> in the disputed <LOCATION> Moroccan </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and said police were holding <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Namou </PERSON> pending charges. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said the man forced the crew of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maroc </ORGANIZATION> ATR-42 turboprop to fly to the Canaries after it left <LOCATION> Smara </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> on a regularly scheduled flight to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aaiun </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Namou </PERSON> let the six passengers leave unharmed two hours after the plane made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> Gando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and gave himself up to police unconditionally two hours and 35 minutes after that, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. He said the two crew members were freed unharmed when <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Namou </PERSON> surrendered. Earlier, a police officer at the airport said the plane carried four crew. Moroccan King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is to make his first official visit to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> on Sunday, and both <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordonez </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Namou </PERSON> had demanded that a letter concerning the visit be made public. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said the letter seemed motivated more by religious than political beliefs but gave no details. In <LOCATION> Rabat </LOCATION>, the Moroccan capital, the airline referred to hijacker as `` mentally unstable.'' Grand <LOCATION> Canary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 135 miles west of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, is part of the seven-island chain that is one of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s 17 autonomous regions <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> abandoned its colony in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> in 1975, and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> sent thousands of civilians to occupy the area. The <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> also claims the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and has waged a desert guerrilla war against the Moroccan army since 1975. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Polisario have accepted in principle a U.N.-supervised referendum to determine the fate of the 102,700-square-mile territory inhabited by about 73,000 mainly nomadic Western Saharans. In <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, Polisario spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hash </PERSON> said his organization had nothing to do with the hijacking.

 The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' list of 25 films deemed `` culturally, historically or esthetically significant'' drew generally favorable reviews Tuesday from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> and other film industry figures. `` I'm delighted,'' said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, whose `` Some Like It Hot'' and `` Sunset Boulevard'' are listed. `` I wish things would go forward to reconstruct those films as they were, not colorized and not butchered by cuts.'' `` The first thing that crossed my mind,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who starred in the <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> film `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' also on the list, `` is that I'm glad that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is still with us and can enjoy his vindication.'' `` I think it's a terrific list; I'd like to see all of them,'' commented <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only omission I see is ` The Apartment,' but <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is pretty well represented.'' `` I'm so happy these 25 films have been selected,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiller </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'd be even happier if more films could have been selected, as the -LRB- Congressional -RRB- bill intended. I'd be happiest if there were no need for a bill, and the moral rights of all artists not to have their works altered or defaced would be protected.'' The major surprise among the selections for the new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registry </ORGANIZATION> was the 1969 `` The Learning Tree,'' a semi-autobiographical film of a black boy's rural childhood by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, famed Life magazine photographer. `` I'm surprised, pleasantly so,'' said <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> at his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> residence. `` I'm very happy. The film was very well received in its release, and it's still playing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and on television here.'' The National Film Registry is the outgrowth of protests by filmmakers over the colorization and the editing for television of classic films. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year passed the National Film Preservation Act which called for the naming of 25 classic films annually for three years. `` I'm delighted to be one of the 25, but I'm horrified at the necessity of the act,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Donen </PERSON>, the director of the musical `` Singin' in the Rain.'' <PERSON> Donen </PERSON> said that the act will do nothing to keep broadcasters from editing movies for length or duplicating them with poor quality control onto videocassettes. The aim, said Librarian of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilington </PERSON> in announcing the first 25 Tuesday, was to help promote movies as an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> art form and generate public interest in preserving films. `` I think it's as good a list as we can expect the first time out,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehr </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a very safe, conservative list. ... I wish the list had been a little more reflective of bread and butter Hollywood.'' Said film critic <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltin </PERSON>: `` I feel that they've chosen such generally outstanding titles that whatever omissions one could argue this year will be rectified next year if not the year after.'' A board of 13 film figures made the final selection, drawing from a thousand nominations from the public. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> made his comments in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, between a bookstore signing for his new volume of poetry and a visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to campaign for more protection for films. He recalled the premiere of `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' at Constitution Hall in 1939. The invited senators became restive at the film's depiction of political corruption. The film broke during the screening, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> recalled, and by the time <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> returned to his seat after climbing to the projection booth to repair it, `` half his audience was gone. ... The press was completely against the picture, too.'' `` The main thing is that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is still here to enjoy his vindication,'' said the actor. <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> has been in failing health at his home in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quinta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> was his usual acerbic self in calling for greater protection for films: `` The television people call in a butcher, who has failed at the <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> grocery store, to supervise the cutting of pictures so they can slip in the Noxema commercials Frankly, nobody gives a -- --.'' The list of 25 offers some surprises, especially `` The Learning Tree,'' as well as glaring omissions. <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s mishmash of history, `` Intolerance,'' was selected, but not his great classic, `` The Birth of a Nation,'' perhaps because of its sympathetic portrayal of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. King <PERSON> Vidor </PERSON>'s `` The Crowd'' was included but not his more impressive achievement, `` The Big Parade.'' <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westerns </ORGANIZATION> are represented by `` The Searchers'' and not his landmark `` Stagecoach.'' Other debatable choices: <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>'s 1922 documentary, `` Nanook of the North''; <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kubrick </ORGANIZATION>'s 1964 `` Dr. <PERSON> Strangelove </PERSON>''; <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murnau </PERSON>'s 1927 `` Sunrise.'' Among the missing: `` The Treasure of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madre </LOCATION>''; `` It's a Wonderful Life''; `` It Happened One Night''; `` All about Eve''; `` Shane''; `` Top Hat''; `` The African Queen''; `` Rebecca''; `` From Here to Eternity.'' Besides <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, double selections were <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, who directed both `` Gone with the Wind'' and `` The Wizard of Oz'' in 1939, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Grapes of Wrath'' and `` The Searchers.''

 Consumer prices did not rise at all last month as big declines in the cost of gasoline and women's clothing combined to provide the best news on inflation since early 1986, the government said Tuesday. The August performance of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index followed modest increases of 0.2 percent in both June and July and left analysts marveling at the better-than-expected showing on inflation. `` The August inflation result was outstanding from the point of view of the consumer,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The bread-and-butter categories of food, housing, transportation and clothing showed either big declines or very small increases.'' The modest price increases starting in June represented a sharp contrast from the first part of the year, when surges in energy and food costs pushed inflation up to a disturbing annual rate of 6.7 percent. With the string of good reports, consumer prices are now rising at an annual rate of 4.8 percent, up only slightly from the 4.4 percent increases registered in both 1987 and 1988. The inflation rate fell by 0.3 percent in April 1986. In another economic report Tuesday, the government said that construction of new homes and apartments dropped by 5 percent in August, falling to an annual rate of 1.35 million units. Economists blamed increases in mortgage rates during August for the setback. They said that the improved outlook for inflation should help push mortgage rates down in coming months and should keep the housing market from going into a tailspin. `` Builders saw rates rising and got a case of the jitters, but we think that interest rates will start moving down again in the months ahead as various indicators suggest that the inflation threat is subsiding very quickly,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is predicting a 5 percent inflation rate for this year, a view supported by many private economists, who believe that recent increases in crude oil prices will translate into slighlty higher monthly inflation numbers for the remainder of the year. `` We think that inflation is probably going to move up a little bit, but we are not looking for anything like the surge we had at the beginning of 1989,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratajczak </PERSON>, director of the economic forecasting project at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said that the underlying inflation rate is running between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, where it has been for much of this decade For August, the main moderating force on prices was a steep 4.2 percent plunge in gasoline prices. It was the biggest one-month decrease in pump prices in three years and followed smaller declines of 1 percent in June and 2.2 percent in July. Gasoline prices had shot up 21.2 percent in the first five months of the year. Also holding down prices was a 1.5 percent drop in clothing prices in August, led by a big drop in women's clothing costs. The decline was credited to larger than normal end-of-season price cuts and the effect of the stronger dollar, which makes imported goods less expensive. Food costs, which shot up at an annual rate of 9.3 percent at the beginning of the year because of the lingering effects of the 1988 drought, were well behaved in August, posting a small 0.2 percent rise. Declines in the cost of pork, poultry, fruits and vegetables helped offset higher prices for beef, fish and eggs. Overall transportation costs fell 1.5 percent in August, reflecting not only the drop in gasoline prices but also declines in the cost of new and used cars. One of the few categories failing to show price moderation during the month was the cost of medical care, which climbed by 0.7 percent for the fourth month in a row. The price of all goods and services excluding food and energy rose just 0.2 percent last month, a modest increase which gave analysts encouragement that the underlying inflation rate is returning to a more moderate pace as well. Analysts said despite the good inflation news, they were not looking for any immediate move on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates. They said that despite the moderating inflationary pressures, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was under no pressure to cut interest rates because the overall economy is moving ahead at a healthy clip. The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at 124.6 in August, meaning that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods costing $ 100 in the base period of 1982-84 would have cost $ 124.60 last month.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> assured his followers he `` would not lie to you about anything'' in excerpts of his television shows viewed Tuesday by jurors at his fraud trial. The jury is being shown eight hours culled from broadcasts of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s `` PTL Show,'' much of it dealing with `` lifetime partnerships.'' Followers were asked to buy $ 1,000 partnerships, guaranteeing three nights' lodging a year for life at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` I'm sincere, I would not lie to you about anything,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told viewers in one excerpt. `` Mr. IRS got to me first, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> just took everything we could scrape together. Next month will be a little better for me.'' In a 1984 videotape, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> urged his audience to pay for partnerships with a credit card, saying he bought his with a credit card because he did n't have any cash. That same year, prosecutors said, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> received $ 1 million in salary and bonuses and bought a <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home and a <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of diverting more than $ 3.7 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money raised from `` lifetime partnership'' sales to pay for personal luxuries. If found guilty of the 24 counts against him, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $ 5 million. The jury saw about six hours of the videotapes on Tuesday, and were expected to begin viewing more of the tapes on Wednesday, after which the prosecution is expected to rest its case. In a December 1984 videotape, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was shown saying, ` If I ever see anyone at this place robbing or stealing, they are going to jail,'' to which someone in the courtroom audience shouted `` Amen.'' In another broadcast, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> complained that more than 900 people had used invalid credit cards or bad checks to buy partnerships. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> reopened partnership sales in the Heritage Grand Hotel at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. `` Some people's credit cards did not go through and some people's checks went through and through and through again They bounced from here to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> also sold partnerships for another hotel at <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, Towers Hotel. Sales were reopened in 1986, even though investigators say more than 30,000 partnerships in the Towers Hotel already had been sold. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told viewers he had $ 8 million in unpaid bills on the Towers. `` I'm going to give something that's the best bargain in the world,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said on a show recorded May 31, 1986. `` When you're desperate, you do desperate things. Witnesses called earlier in the trial have testified they bought the partnerships but could not get rooms. Others have testified that partnerships were oversold and that the money from such promotions often was used to cover <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s day-to-day operating costs rather than finance construction of the guaranteed rooms and buildings. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, who produced the tape, said more than 66,000 partnerships were sold to viewers by the time <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987, despite a publicized limit of 25,000.

 Many AIDS patients die as a direct result of simply wasting away because their bodies are unable to retain enough food for adequate nourishment, according to a study released Tuesday by a <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher. `` Improving nutritional status provides a reasonable expectation'' for prolonging life and maintaining the quality of life for AIDS patients, reports Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotler </PERSON>, an associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> and Surgeons and the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lukes-Roosevelt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In a study published in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kotler </PERSON> estimated that 70 percent to 80 percent of AIDS patients die as a result of wasting away. In studying the process, <PERSON> Kotler </PERSON> uses a measurement called body cell mass _ the weight of muscle and organs, excluding fat, bone and water outside the cells. In a study 32 AIDS patients, patients died when the body-cell mass dropped to an average of 54 percent of the ideal. The study started 100 days before death when the average body-cell mass was 71 percent of the ideal. Body-cell mass gives a more accurate picture of the state of malnutrition because patients can lose body-cell mass while not losing weight dramatically, <PERSON> Kotler </PERSON> said. In a comments at a meeting Tuesday of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biology </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kotler </PERSON> said the study did not determine the precise mechanism that causes death due to malnutrition among AIDS patients. `` We do not know whether death is due to a general cellular starvation so that a critical number of cells stop functioning or some critical organ, such as the brain, liver, kidneys or heart, stops functioning,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> told the meeting that <PERSON> Kotler </PERSON>'s study suggests that a control of malnutrition among AIDS patients might prolong life. `` While we will have to wait on studies to prove that adequate nutrition can prolong life in AIDS patients, from a doctor's point of view, I consider it only responsible to treat patients with the information that we have,'' said <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON> said vomiting and diarrhea are the most common causes of malnutrition among AIDS patients, and these symptoms often can be treated with drugs or food selection that will improve nutrition. `` While nutrition does not solve the primary problem, the AIDS viral infection, it can improve the quality of patients' lives,'' he said. `` Many problems that cause malnutirition in AIDS patients are treatable by fairly simple interventions.'' In another report at the meeting, scientists from <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> reported that they cleared all detectable signs of AIDS from a patient through a combination of radiation and chemotherapy to kill the patient's bone marrow cells, AZT to prevent the AIDS virus from invading new cells, and a bone marrow transplant. The patient, a 41-year-old man, died 46 days after the treatment from a type of cancer, but no trace of AIDS genetic material could be detected in tissue samples from the patient. `` Even though the patient died, we believe we demonstrated that he was cleared of all signs of the AIDS virus,'' said Dr. Rein Saral, a <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> associate professor. He cautioned the results should not be interpreted as a `` cure'' for AIDS because the virus could still have been present in some cells of the patient's body.

 Two brothers suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> went on a beating and stabbing rampage in this <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> town known as a stronghold of the Palestinian uprising, witnesses said Tuesday. The incident was set off when the house of one brother was stoned by masked youths. It reflected the growing tension between the youthful enforcers of the 21-month-old uprising and Palestinians accused to cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and killed <PERSON> Amer </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansur </PERSON>, 21, Arab hospital officials reported. Military officials confirmed the death and said a patrol fired after being attacked with two firebombs, killing the attacker. In other clashes in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded 16 Palestinians, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. The army command confirmed five wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and said it was checking further. Authorities in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, reported that 10 people were injured, at least 1,700 acres of forest and grassland were burned and a settlement was threatened Tuesday in a big forest arson attack. The fires began around noon on the slopes of Mt. <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> and threatened the kibbutz, or communal settlement, of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oren </LOCATION>. Officials there said 80 children and 40 adults were evacuated. The fire also crept close to <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Daniya </LOCATION> neighborhood. Police later arrested two arson suspects, said <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbel </PERSON>, deputy superintendent of the northern police district. In <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Atrash </PERSON> was among the victims in Monday night's rampage. He was reportedly pulled from his car and held hostage for an hour. <PERSON> Al-Atrash </PERSON> was hospitalized Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> with bruises and a gashed head. In the melee, Palestinian youths set fire to the brothers' homes and seriously damaged them, townspeople said. The army did not intervene in the incident in this town near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, but on Tuesday arrested a third brother for suspected involvement in the fray, residents said. An army spokesman said he had no information on the trouble in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahur </LOCATION>. The fracas began Monday night when dozens of masked youths threw bottles and stones at the house of <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahlan </PERSON>. According to residents in this town of 11,000 people, <PERSON> Zahlan </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> were active in the uprising but were converted into informers while jailed for their activities in the revolt. After the stoning, witnesses said, the brothers and several relatives got knives and clubs and went into the streets, stopping cars and beating passengers. One victim was dragged from a car and stabbed in the shoulder, arm and leg, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition their names not be used. The mayor also was pulled from his car, then beaten at <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahlan </PERSON>'s house, townspeople said. The army meanwhile said it soon will assign `` monitors'' to units in the occupied lands as a way of cutting down shooting wounds to women and children during clashes with soldiers. An army spokeswoman, who can not be identified by name under military regulations, said the monitors would be assinged to watch firing when women and children are present. She said they would be assigned `` in the next few days.'' More than 100 children under age 16 were among the 573 Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians since the uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987. Forty Israelis also have died. At least 114 Arabs have been killed by fellow Palestinians as suspected collaborators.

According to a joint communique issued Tuesday by the Ethiopian and <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> delegations, the two sides agreed to 13 items during the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> talks, which were held to develop a framework for peace talks. Both sides also indicated a desire for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to play a continuing role in peacemaking efforts. But differences remained over the chairmanship, observers and staff for the future talks. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> delegation leader <PERSON> Ashegre </PERSON> <PERSON> Yigletu </PERSON> and Eritrean delegation head <PERSON> Al-Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saiyed </PERSON> said much progress had been made during the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> talks, but cautioned that an end to the war is not imminent. `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has been an arena within which they could build up mutual trust,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, differences on major issues are still there. `` For 28 years they have not been able to make this much progress, and many hundreds of thousands of people have perished,'' he said. The items agreed to during the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> talks were mostly procedural, though the two sides did agree that the sites for the peace talks will be rotated between <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sana </ORGANIZATION>' a, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, Ashura and <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>. A date has not been set for the peace talks. The duties and functions of the chairman or co-chairmen were agreed upon. The Eritreans, however, want <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to serve as chairman with a co-chairman selected from among the heads of state of the venue countries. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> wants two equal and permanent co-chairmen, with one being an African leader. The two sides disagreed over whether observers may only be representatives of nations, or if they may represent international organizations. Earlier in the talks, the possibility was raised over whether a cease-fire could be effected during the interim between the preliminary discussions and the peace talks. Both sides Tuesday declined to commit to such action before the peace talks. Combat and famine have combined to kill an estimated 1 million people since <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> went to war in 1961. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> considers the war a battle of secession, while the Eritreans view the war as a battle for independence. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, a northern province, was joined with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in a federation the Eritreans opposed. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> provides <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s only direct access to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. After several attempts to arrange peace talks over the years failed, the two sides earlier this year agreed for <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to serve as a neutral observer for preliminary discussions aimed at setting an agenda for peace talks. The talks were suspended over the weekend while <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for a previously scheduled fact-finding mission before that country's national elections. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> plans to act as an observer to the February voting.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Approves Amendment Seeking International Drift Net Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An amendment that would require the administration to seek an international ban on high seas drift net fishing was approved by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said last week that while they thought such a ban would eventually be discussed in an international forum, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needed more data on the effects of drift net fishing before pushing for one. `` There are those who say it is premature, but it would be irresponsible to sit on our hands,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, D-Wash., who sponsored the drift net amendment `` We already know our salmon are being stolen.'' The data will be gathered under provisions of recently negotiated agreements with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the three nations with drift net fleets operating in the <PERSON> Nouth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacific </PERSON>. The amendment was attached to bill reauthorizing the so-called Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Managment Act of 1976, which created the 200-mile <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishing zone and eight regional fisheries councils to manage the ocean resources. The reauthorization bill adopted by the committee's fisheries and wildlife conservation subcommittee requires the secretary of state to seek `` as soon as possible'' an international drift net ban and to report back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 18 months on the progress of negotiations including a list of nations that have refused to talk. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fishermen claim the drift net fleets, under the guise of fishing for squid, are actually harvesting salmon in quantities that have already caused a drop in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> fish runs. Environmental groups have also claimed the nets are responsible for the deaths of thousands of marine mammals, sea birds and other marine animals annually. Subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., said `` no other fishing method is as destructive or indiscriminate'' as drift nets and the legislation would `` set a national goal'' of banning drift net fishing on the high seas

 A former nursing home aide charged with smothering five patients testified Tuesday that the alleged murder plot was nothing more than a fictitious game that got out of hand. The defense rested after the testimony of <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who is charged with five counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder on allegations she suffocated incapacitated patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in Walker between January and April 1987. Defense and prosecution attorneys later finished their closing arguments and the case went to the jury, which began deliberationa before adjourning for the night. If convicted, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> faces life in prison without parole. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 26, denied killing any patients or knowing of any murders at the home. She testified that her former lesbian lover, nurse's aide <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, often concocted stories and spread rumors, and that she usually went along to humor her. The alleged murder plot was one of those `` head games,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` At first it was a joke.'' But when <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> began seeing another woman, she said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> threatened to `` make someone believe the story that we had been killing patients.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 27, has pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder. In exchange for her testimony against <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, two counts of first-degree murder were dropped. Wood will be sentenced later. When police began investigating the deaths after <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> moved back to her hometown of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with the other woman, she said she realized that <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> `` was going to get even, just like she said she was.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s testimony disputed that of several of her friends and former lovers, who testified that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, on separate occasions, had admitted suffocating patients at the home. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said she did not admit killing patients, but related the story as one Wood had made up. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said she only once claimed to have suffocated patients in an effort to scare another woman, she said. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said she decided to leave <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> for another lover because `` I was tired of playing games, hurting people. ... The games just got out of hand.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> dominated their relationship, often starting fights between <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and other women and once threatening <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> with a gun. The testimony contrasted <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s account of the affair. During closing arguments, the prosecutor told the jury that the case was not a `` referendum on homosexuality.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said the killings `` relieved tension.''

 Four men were executed after security agents uncovered at the last minute a plot to overthrow President <PERSON> Blaise </PERSON> <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Burkina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Two of the four were in the top echelon of the government, it reported. The agency said agents thwarted the plotters' attempt to arrest <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON> upon his return from a trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> late Monday. Reached by telex from <LOCATION> Abidjan </LOCATION>, the agency quoted government spokesman <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouedraogo </PERSON> as saying the coup leaders planned to seize the airport and if they met resistance, to shoot down <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON>'s plane when it approached. <PERSON> Ouedraogo </PERSON> spoke at a news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Ouagadougou </LOCATION>, capital of the impoverished <LOCATION> Sahelian </LOCATION> nation. The agency said <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON> was calm, and that no fighting has taken place. <PERSON> Ouedraogo </PERSON> said Maj. <PERSON> Jean-Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Boukary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lingani </PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Zongo </PERSON>, effectively the No. 2 and No. 3 men in <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON>'s Popular Front military government, were executed along with two other military plotters, not identified. The agency quoted <PERSON> Ouedraogo </PERSON> as saying Capt. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Diendere </PERSON>, in charge of presidential security, discovered the scheme just before <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON> returned. The executions mark the final breakup of a clique of young officers who came to power with Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankara </PERSON> in Aug. 4, 1983. <PERSON> Zongo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lingani </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON> close friends of <LOCATION> Sankara </LOCATION>, supported <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON> in his overthrow and killing of <PERSON> Sankara </PERSON> on Oct. 15, 1987. First word of the coup attempt came in a communique read on the government-controlled radio. It said, `` Our people and revolution, and its militants at all levels, have just escaped, on the night of Sept. 18, 1989, a cowardly plot fomented by military and fascist elements led by some ambitious and anti-revolutionary people who are at the very top of the political leadership.'' It specifically named <PERSON> Lingani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zongo </PERSON> and said their objectives `` were to dissolve the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and all the political organizations and to restore fascist authority.'' <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON>, victim of recurring droughts in the past two decades, has experienced six military coups since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960.

 A teen who held 11 students hostage pleaded guilty Tuesday to kidnapping and endangerment charges and was placed in state custody for psychological tests, and his classmates expressed compassion instead of anger. `` Nobody seems mad at him,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Issacs </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where the 10-hour standoff Monday ended peacefully. <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, 17, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 13 counts of wanton endangerment and 13 counts of kidnapping Tuesday, said <PERSON> LaDonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a state police dispatcher in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. The two additional charges involve a teacher who was released at the start of the incident; and another student who was held overnight. Police said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> took 11 hostages at his high school in a desperate plea to see his distant father. State Police Detective <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said the incident was a plot directly from <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s thriller novel, `` Rage. The book, found in <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s room at his grandparent's house, centers on a teen-ager enraged with his father who takes hostages at a school. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who was armed with two pistols and a shotgun, released the hostages sporadically, then surrendered. Authorities arranged for his father to come to <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> from his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> home, but the boy gave up before his father arrived. Interviews with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s classmates and others in this town of 1,000 about 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> depicted a well-behaved, quiet teen-ager, a straight-A student. `` It's just a mystery, the way it happened,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputy sheriff. <PERSON> Neeley </PERSON> said officers never had any problem with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` He's a real good boy,'' he added. Eight counselors were brought to the high school to help students deal with the aftermath of the hostage-takinga. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> blew out a classroom window with a shotgun blast shortly after taking over his world civilization class. Neither <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> nor any of the hostages were injured. `` Everybody is feeling sorry for him and what he's going through,'' said <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 17. He said he hoped <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> would receive help `` to see what caused it and prevent it from ever happening again.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, principal at the 500-student school, said students voiced their concern for <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> rather than anger. `` They're already wanting to know if we have heard from -LRB- <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> -RRB- today, how he's doing, can we send him a card, a letter, a video, anything to let him know that we still care about him, that he is still our friend,'' said Mrs. Bond. She expected students to show some compassion for the youth, but said she was surprised `` for it to be as strong as it is.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was placed in the custody of the state Cabinet for Human Resources for psychological tests. He was taken to a treatment center in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> after pleading guilty Tuesday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> sees no need to stop <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> from getting ready to decommission the new <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the commission said in a letter released Tuesday. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has vowed to try to keep the plant intact, and had asked the commission to stop the company from dsiabling the reactor before the commission could rule on the transfer of its operating license to local and state authorities for decommissioning. `` Although <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> has indicated its intent not to operate <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> and the agreement between <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> and the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> indicates an intent to decommission the facility, thus far the activities that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> is carrying out are authorized under the existing license,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, the commission chairman, said in a Sept. 15 letter to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has also called for a full environmental review of the shutdown plan in an effort to compel <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to keep the plant in mothballs. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> that the plant would not be allowed to deteriorate while the commission considers whether to transfer its license to the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. That authority plans to hire the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> to do the actual decommissioning work. The company has removed fuel from the reactor and cut staff, spurring complaints from <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> wrote, `` We do not believe that reduction in staff at the facility warrants enforcement or sanction.'' The fully licensed plant, about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, has never operated commercially. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> negotiated a plan to buy the plant for $ 1 in order to tear it down, maintaining that the area could not be safely evacuated in the event of an accident.

 Forecasters consulted computers, satellites and yellowing hurricane charts Tuesday in a frantic effort to plot the course of Hurricane Hugo, which might hit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this weekend. Then again, it might not. `` When you look out two to three days in the future, that's when we have our most difficult problems,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>. `` We have a lot of different things going on.'' Forecasters said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> should watch <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s uncertain path carefully. The hurricane, leaving devastation behind in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, was moving past the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and could affect <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by Friday, forecasters said. They added, however, that it could also miss the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> entirely. A variety of weather factors, some as far away as <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, could determine <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s course. But the most likely effect will come from the combination of a low-pressure system moving west across southern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and a broad high-pressure ridge, the `` <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> High,'' to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s north. The high-pressure system probably will block <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> from spinning harmlessly out into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, as <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> did last week, forecasters said, while the low-pressure system could lure <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> westward. Forecasters said the varying factors also would affect the storm's strength, which was slowly rebuilding Tuesday after falling from 140 mph winds to 105 mph. Forecasters watched data spit out of advanced computers, studied satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> `` hurricane hunter'' planes, and even pulled out old hurricane charts to see what storms similar to <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> have done. `` We were just looking through a bunch of the old charts,'' Sheets said. `` They've done everything. They've done loopity-loops, they've gone into south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, they've gone into central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, all the way up to the Carolinas.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reconnaissance crew that flew into Hugo Tuesday said the eye was about 30 to 40 miles across and the pressure had risen to about 965 millibars _ a sign of weakening. `` It's weaker than in the past few days, but it's still a significant hurricane,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON>. Hurricane <PERSON> David </PERSON>, a destructive hurricane that hit eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands 10 years ago, swept past <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, hit the island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION>, moved through the western <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, then made landfall on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s middle east coast. So far, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> has moved from the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, then away from <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION> and was headed slightly east of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Computer models that use all available weather data, past records and physics equations were laying out conflicting futures for <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, Sheets said. The best advice forecasters could offer, Sheets said, was for coastal residents across the southeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be ready.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday failure to remove an improperly manufactured vent plug during refueling of a B-52 bomber led to a fuel spill and explosion in July that killed one person and injured 11.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sharing a platform with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> at a centennial tree-planting ceremony, prodded the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to move more quickly on his clean-air proposals. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> challenged Democratic leaders to finish work on his proposed overhaul of the Clean Air Act of 1974 this year _ a target <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the nation's top-ranking elected Democrat, had called possible but `` unlikely.'' Suggesting his legislation had been languishing in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` Every day that passes is another day we're postponing progress on clean air.'' To a crowd of several thousand sprawled on the banks of the <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> under bright skies in <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s hometown, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We need action on the legislation we've proposed _ now. `` We've brought people together and put a sound proposal on the table. Now it's up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass this clean-air legislation this year.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals call for tougher standards on acid rain, urban smog and industrial emissions. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the president's backers won an important victory in the envrionment subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A 12-10 vote turned rejected an amendment to the president's clean air package backed by environmental groups that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters argued would be too tough on cities and small businesses. The Democratic chairman of the parent committee, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, is backing the president's plan. Meanwhile, the president issued in a statement expressing `` concern and sympathy'' for victims of Hurricane Hugo. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` all necessary federal resources will be quickly mobilized to help the people of the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> recover from this disaster.'' In advance of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> planned to move forward on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean-air legislation but that action this year was `` possible but unlikely.'' `` If I were prudent, I would say early next year,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters Monday, also predicting that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would modify the proposal. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, made the excursion into <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s congressional district for a ceremony marking <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 100th anniversary as a state. It was the final stop on a two-day swing that included similar centennial observations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who told the crowd <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit was `` a proud moment for the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' sat impassively through the president's remarks directed at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> But the speaker clapped politely when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for action this year prompted a wave of applause from the crowd. Despite needling the Democratic leadership, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> in the speech as `` a man of integrity, decency, fair play. OK, he's a Democrat. But he's a man I am very proud to be able to work with.'' Flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters, `` I do n't think the president really expects that every time he should send a proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, we would just automatically say, ` Well, this is better than anyone could possible improve on, therefore we'll enact it without any question or without any additions.''' Asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s complaint Monday that the Democrats' response to his drug strategy and other initiatives is always to `` spend more and raise taxes,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> replied: `` Well, with the greatest respect since I'm flying in his airplane, I do n't agree with the suggestion that we are trying to tax more or to spend more.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also said he thinks <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will eventually lose the fight over reducing the capital gains tax, despite the president's initial victory in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going to do our best on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to defeat the proposal, which I think is unwise and ill-timed, unfair. ... This is one in which the president and we have a very clear disagreement. And we'll have an alternative proposal to consider when it reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has planted a tree and stressed environmental themes at each stop, called for `` a new environmental awareness on the part of all Americans.'' Saying pollution is n't caused just by power plants and large industries, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed a major volunteer effort on the part of all Americans to `` generate less wastes and recycle more of the waste that is generated.'' He said the `` opportunity to renew the environmental ethic in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' was `` an opportunity we ca n't afford to miss.'' `` I plan to stay involved, helping to protect our precious environment, as long as I am president,'' he asserted. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean-air proposals were announced June 12 but not formally submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> until July 21. The package calls for a 10-billion-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from power plant and other industrial stacks by the year 2000. Sulfur dioxide pollution drifts in the atmosphere with prevailing winds and returns to earth as acid rain. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan also calls for a 2-million-ton reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions and a 40 percent reduction in hydrocarbon emissions, which produce urban smog. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as he has done in other centennial states, planted in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Riverfront </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> _ site of a 1974 world's fair _ a sapling from a White House elm planted by President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in 1828. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the administration proposed a modification in the provision of its clean-air bill that would permit automakers to average auto emissions to meet anti-pollution requirements. The modification, criticized by environmental groups, would still allow motor vehicle manufacturers to meet stricter anti-pollution requirements by averaging pollution among engine families. But it would make clear that reductions under averaging must equal the improvement that would be achieved if each model were forced to meet the emissions standards. Current law requires each model to meet the standards.

 A sheriff's Explorer Scout who touted the anti-gang message was shot down half a block from his home in a drive-by shooting, a victim of the raging violence he fought to stop. No arrests had been made Tuesday afternoon in the slaying of <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, 19, who was shot to death at 1:15 p.m. Monday by several gang members inside a <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>, said Deputy <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahla </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> was hit several times in the chest and died at <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's seen the streets, he knows what's out there. He knew what the risks were,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, an adviser for the Explorer Scout program at the sheriff's station in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> worked as a volunteer. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a minister's son who aspired to a career with the sheriff's department, had received death threats from gang members, neighbors said. He diligently warned children and residents to stay indoors when street thugs were on the prowl. `` <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was very strong on assisting others in staying out of gang associations,'' said <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Sgt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Diviak </PERSON>, supervisor in charge of the scouts. `` He was very outspoken against gangs, that's the best way of putting it. <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> stressed that scouts are not told to take a stance against street hoodlums because of the danger they could face. `` We really warn them against telling anyone of their even being an Explorer,'' <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> did this on his own. He donated a lot of his time helping deputies. He was a second pair of eyes in the -LRB- patrol -RRB- vehicle.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, who planned to enter the Sheriff's Academy on Nov. 17, conducted his own patrols in his crime-ridden <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> neighborhood, said Deputy <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Damion </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldrew </PERSON>, 12, said <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> had warned neighborhood kids just days before about possible gang retaliation because of his warnings. `` He said watch out, some gang bangers were trying to kill him,'' <PERSON> Muldrew </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> student who graduated with a 3.7 grade point average, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> became an Explorer Scout in 1986.

 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Garba </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, a retired army general who once served in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peackeeping force, on Tuesday became president of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. In a news conference prior to Tuesday's opening of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>'s 44th session, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said, `` I think that in the present General Assembly, there are subjects of great importance politically. There is <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, Iran-Iraq, <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB-, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` On the social aspect, I think it is extremely important that this year the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> gives importance to real social questions. Not only human rights, which always is reserved in first place in our concerns, but the environment, AIDS and terrorism,'' he said. Rain forests were added to the agenda by environmentalists who pushed 12 wheelbarrows into the marble lobby of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and dumped petitions with 3 million signatures asking the world body to save the forests. Organizers from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainforest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> refused to leave without personally meeting <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials, confronted by mounds of paper that the organizers said were petitions from 23 countries, arranged a meeting with the secretary-general. He met with a delegation of representatives from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The Malaysia-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainforest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which says it represents 60 nongovernmental organizations, is seeking a special <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session to halt the destruction of rain forests. A special session of the 159-nation assembly only can be called at the request of a majority of its member governments and a costly special session is considered unlikely. <PERSON> Garba </PERSON>, 46, is <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He is a former foreign minister and has been chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartheid </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Peacekeeping Operations. Under a system of rotating regional representation, the African nations nominated the assembly president this year and <PERSON> Garba </PERSON> was chosen over <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Engo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>'s ambassador. <PERSON> Garba </PERSON> retired from the army in 1980 with the rank of major general. In his address to the assembly he said, `` At the age of 22, as a captain in the Nigerian army, I participated in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> India-Pakistan Observer Mission, where I donned the blue helmet for the first time. That operation enabled me to appreciate first-hand the laudable role of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in conflict resolutions.'' That observer group has monitored the truce between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> since 1949. <PERSON> Garba </PERSON> said international peace can not be secure in a world in which nations' economies are in decline and inequity exists between classes and states. `` There is now widespread recognition that the external debt crisis has economic, political and social consequences,'' he said. He called for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> as well as major donor countries to provide resources for debt reduction.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has issued arrest warrants for two Israelis accused of training hit squads for the drug cartels waging war on the government, an official said Tuesday. Acting on a request by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, a judge issued the warrants Monday night for a former Israeli army colonel, <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, and businessman <PERSON> Arik </PERSON> <PERSON> Acek </PERSON>. `` They are wanted for violating laws against conspiring, teaching and enlisting civilians in military operations without the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>,'' said security department spokeswoman <PERSON> Divas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>. An Israeli Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has no extradition treaty with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` The ambassador has been very clear about this,'' he added. He said Israeli police have concluded an investigation into the <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> case and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> there has to decide what, if any action to take. Five other Israelis suspected of training gunmen for the cartels also were investigated. Ms. <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Acek </ORGANIZATION> are thought to have entered <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in August 1988 and to have left the country this year after reports surfaced that foreign mercenaries were training private armies for the drug lords, mostly in the <LOCATION> Magadelena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Medio </LOCATION> region in mountainous, central <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. British Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Neilson </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> TV on Tuesday that British and Colombian intelligence had information in March about British and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> mercenaries training assassination squads for the cartels. `` The governmemt of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> had information about British mercenaries in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in March and we were in position to help them -LRB- the government -RRB-,'' he said. He said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will try to extradite any British who helped traffickers train paramilitary groups, but it was not known how many British may have been involved. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, now home in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, has said he trained Colombian farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas. He said he was unaware they had any involvement with drugs. In the northern coastal city of <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION>, an army raid Tuesday in the house of the manager of a milk company turned up a ton of pure cocaine. Four people were arrested. The owner, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON>, was not at home. In <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, police said they would release a man who was arrested at a ranch near the Colombian border because he bore a `` strong resemblance'' to <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, a top leader of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Giffuni </PERSON>, deputy director of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, said the man and three people arrested with him Monday would be freed immediately. The drug war took a new twist Monday night when a bomb went off in front of a crowded shopping center in the capital, <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Another bomb damaged a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> telephone company outlet. It was the first time a bomb was placed in the early evening in a populated area. Four people, including a child, were injured. Since the crackdown on drug cartels was launched, most bombing targets have been banks and government buildings and most explosions went off late at night, when no one was around. In the past three weeks, 45 bombs have gone off in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, killing four people and injuring 118. No one claimed responsibility, but officials blamed drug barons. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> announced the crackdown after leading presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was assassinated Aug. 18. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> vowed to extradite traffickers wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Colombian <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was extradited Sept. 6 to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in connection with the laundering of more than $ 1.2 billion for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. Two other alleged drug traffickers were arrested last week and await extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But drug kingpins on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' list of the most wanted, the so-called `` Dirty Dozen,'' remain at large and there is no indication the government is close to arresting them. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s attorney general, <PERSON> Alfonseo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, said Tuesday that is because drug traffickers have infiltrated the army and national police. `` It's not for lack of military power that the big narco-traffickers have n't been captured,'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said in an interview with the radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's because they have informants inside the police and army who warn them when there will be operations to arrest them.''

 Actress <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> took the stand in her cop-slapping trial Tueday, telling a jury she feared she would be shot by a towering motorcycle officer who handcuffed her while she was `` screaming like a pig.'' In a trial dominated by her flamboyant behavior, another bizarre development occurred Tuesday, the same day Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> ran from the courtroom, hearing testimony she did n't like. On Tuesday afternoon, Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, the officer who arrested her on June 14, was hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday after his motorcyle collided with a police car. During an emergency call, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>'s cycle collided with a police car at the at Rodeo Drive intersection. He was admitted to <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>, where he was in stable condition with head trauma, severe scrapes and bruises. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> had already testified, but might be needed for further testimony. It was not immediately known what effect his injury might have on Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s trial. Earlier Tuesday, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> collapsed in sobs after stomping out of court during one policeman's testimony that immediately was branded a lie by the star of such films as `` Picture Mommy Dead'' and `` Queen of Outer Space.'' In afternoon testimony, the actress acknowledged scuffling with <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, the 6-foot-4 motorcycle cop who pulled her over on a traffic stop. `` I'm a Hungarian woman ... not a milquetoast.'' But she said she came to fear the motorcycle officer more than she feared <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. The <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> officer actually stopped her twice the day of her June 14 arrest, the second time after she drove away as he attempted to cite her. When he closed on her a second time, she testified she feared he was going to shoot her. `` I was saying to myself ` Uh oh, <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>. Now you've had it.''' She said she sat on a curb, handcuffed. `` I was screaming like a pig,'' she said. Earlier in the day, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> bolted from the courtroom when she disagreed with testimony from another officer who assisted in the arrest. `` I ca n't take this. It's a lie,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> blurted as she left the courtroom seven days into her misdemeanor trial. Defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> immediately led his client back into the courtroom and she broke down in sobs. Municipal Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> ordered a recess while the former Miss <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> regained her composure. The outburst came during testimony by police officer <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who was called to assist the motorcycle officer Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> admitted striking on June 14. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> cursed him. `` She looked at me and said, ` You -LRB- expletive -RRB-, I'm having your job. I'm calling the Reagans on this,''' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> testified. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, a longtime friend and neighbor of the former president, got up and left at that point. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> had been relatively calm during the trial, doodling on a pad and sketching pencil portraits of the judge, clerk, bailiff and even a respectable rendition of Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, the policeman she struck. Her sharp-tongued, out-of-court commentaries to reporters were finally muzzled by the judge after Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> complained the actress was violating a gag order in the case. `` I have a gagging order,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said when questioned as she left the courthouse Monday night. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> is charged with battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and having an open container of alcohol _ a flask of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> whiskey in the glove compartment _ in her car. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> testified he was surprised Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> struck him, saying the assault was unprovoked. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, a foot shorter and 100 pounds lighter than <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, said she struck in self-defense. <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> is expected to contend that <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> allegedly had a prior history of being abusive with citizens pulled over for traffic stops. If convicted, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> faces up to 18 months in jail. <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> said he will conclude his case with testimony from Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>. She was expected to take the stand Friday or early next week. Unable to discuss the case directly, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said last week she feared jail because they are filled with lesbians. `` I'm afraid of lesbians,'' she blurted out. Before her courtroom collapse, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> told reporters that a homosexual group wrote to protest the remarks. `` I never said anything about lesbians. I got a letter from the lesbians. They are outraged. I have so many friends who are. ... I do n't care who is what, I only like good people.''

<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has successfully negotiated with the leftist Sandinista government for the return of a rebel Miskito Indian leader after years of exile. Under the deal, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> dropped a ban on <PERSON> Brooklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> agreed to renounce his fight against the government, refrain from illegal activities and cooperate in the process to hold general elections Feb 25. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> accepted the terms that he and Interior Minister <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> agreed to Monday during a visit to this northeastern seaport. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> would return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> shortly. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1981 to lead an Indian armed struggle against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and has been living in neighboring <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, and talks between the government and exiled Miskito leader, head of the most populous tribe of Nicaraguan Indians, had dragged for four years. Miskito, Sumo and <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> groups, largely English-speaking communities that live along <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast, have been fighting against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> alongside the U.S.-supported Contra rebels since 1980. These are basically the same conditions the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> set for the return of non-Indian Contras. Under a previous Sandinista offer, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> was to disarm his followers within 30 days of his return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said Tuesday that he expected other Indian leaders, including <PERSON> Steadman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagoth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wycliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, to return. The agreement, however, was specifically for <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> announced the agreement on the <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> issue on his return to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, shortly before heading back to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The announcement was the highlight of the former president's three-day trip to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as head of a delegation that will monitor elections in February <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> expressed optimism that the elections would be fair.

<HEAD>Panel to Recommend 35 Percent Increase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task force will present to the leadership this week a call for a congressional pay increase of about 35 percent over two years, a congressional said Tuesday night. Other recommendations would end fees for making speeches and the conversion of campaign funds to personal use. The source, who is in a position to know the recommendations and who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned that the entire package of rules changes planned by the task force could be changed before it is proposed to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which must be done by the end of October. The heart of the package is the pay plan, which would include about a 10 percent raise in 1990 and an additional 25 percent in 1991. After 1991, members would get cost-of-living pay increases. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members currently earn $ 89,500 per year, with leaders earning more. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have to approve any pay increases, which would apply to both bodies. A 35 percent increase would make the salary $ 120,825. A key part of the plan would phase out honoraria _ fees for making speeches, often to organizations lobbying for legislation _ over two years. Since <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members now can keep honoraria totaling 30 percent of their pay, the 35 percent salary increase would mean no member would lose money by the phase-out. The honoraria system has been much criticized by watchdog organizations such as Common Cause. Critics say the fees, limited to $ 2,000 per occasion, too often amount to a reward just for showing up, sometimes at conventions at plush resorts for which the member's expenses are picked up by the sponsors The plan also would phase out the `` grandfather clause'' under which members who were in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in January 1980 can convert leftover campaign funds to personal use when they retire. The date when the prohibition would take full effect has not been settled, the source said. Other provisions of the package call for tightening requirements to disclose gifts. The ethics panel was appointed by former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, after lawmakers earlier this year fought a bitter, divisive battle over a proposed 51 percent pay raise that was rejected after a campaign led by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> and others who argued that it was excessive. The 51 percent proposal came from an advisory commission and was recommended by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. It would have taken effect without a vote unless rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had devised a plan to raise salaries by 30 percent in return for dropping honoraria, but <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members overwhelmingly voted to reject such a plan. Backers of a raise say members have not taken cost-of-living increases in recent years and need a substantial increase to catch up with inflation. Many members feel they must maintain two homes, one in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and one in their districts, and face expenses that others with similar salaries do n't have, the supporters say. The task force of 10 members is equally divided between the parties and chaired by Reps. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill

 A year ago, international arbitration ended the last border dispute between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a squabble over a 250-acre strip of beach and the plush hotel on it. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> lost. Now, six months after the Israelis ceded <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Aviya-Sonesta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> is struggling to develop an Egyptian image while catering to its main clientele, Israelis. `` It's still the same hotel,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, the general manager through successive owners and management chains. But, he said, `` instead of a waiter called <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON>, we now have <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON>.'' Opened in 1982 by its builder, the Egyptian-born Israeli <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Papouchado </PERSON>, the 10-story, 327-room luxury hotel has panoramic views of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>'s rugged mountains. It quickly became a favorite among Israelis whose army seized the Sinai in the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> war of 1967. Although <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> had been in dispute since early 1982 when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to return it with the rest of Sinai under terms of a 1979 peace agreement, Israelis nonetheless were shocked on Sept. 29, 1988, to find the place no longer belonged to them. After deliberating 18 months, international arbitrators ruled that Egyptian claims prevailed and ordered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its occupation. Months of haggling followed over special facilities for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> tourists and compensation to owner <PERSON> Papouchado </PERSON> _ the settlement was $ 37 million _ but <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> finally raised its flag over <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> on March 15. Egyptian nationals marched into the hotel, <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>'s only significant structure, to claim jobs. Outside, Israeli employees burned street barricades of automobile tires and demonstrated to protest their uncertain future. About 280 of the 306 Israeli workers last March have been laid off to comply with <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> law that limits foreign employment to 10 percent of the work force. But manager <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> said in a telephone interview the hotel staff has become a model of co-existence. `` This is beautiful,'' he said. `` I wish the governments would take an example from the harmony.'' Many details remained unsettled and confusion reigned at the turnover in March, but much of that has dissipated as technical problems have been ironed out. Israelis stayed away in the first weeks after the turnover, and the hotel's occupancy rate fell from better than 90 percent to around 40 percent. <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> said that by August it had recovered much of the lost ground. Hotel shopowners, mostly Israelis, feared working under <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s more stringent import controls, but they've settled into their new state of affairs Prices on menus are being changed gradually to Egyptian pounds from Israeli shekels and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars. <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, at the northern tip of the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>, 230 miles east of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, was a wasteland at the end of a desert wadi when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. Thus, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has no infrastructure there to support the hotel and must buy water, electricity and some goods from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>'s telephone lines are linked through <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> And because there is no housing at <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> other than the hotel, Egyptian employees must travel 90 miles a day to and from <LOCATION> Nuweiba </LOCATION> to go to work. The 28 Israeli employees commute from <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> port which is close by. They work in positions where Hebrew is necessary to communicate with patrons. The Egyptian personnel manager, <PERSON> Aly </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON>, said Israeli singers and two belly dancers still perform but with fewer Hebrew songs. Although their flag flies over <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> now, Egyptians have n't flocked to the resort One reason may be room rates of $ 150 a night. Few Egyptians can afford even the reduced rate of $ 54, which is high for a country with an average monthly take-home pay of $ 40. But <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s tourism minister, said plans are under way to promote <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> worldwide as a warm-weather resort and to equip a nearby landing strip for large airplanes. `` Until <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> was returned to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, it was only a satellite of <LOCATION> Eilat </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Now it's our goal to create something that says, ` This is really <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.'''

 Environmentalists are concerned that a quest for gold, uranium and other minerals threatens severe damage to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> and the way of life of the territory's 12 Indian tribes The territory of about 70,000 square miles of jungle and granite is an an extension of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>, already exploited and damaged by the clearing of rain forests for development and by wildcat mining. The mighty Orinoco River forms in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amazonas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territory </ORGANIZATION> and makes its way eastward to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. But the territory also contains precious minerals in its soil and riverbeds, mainly gold and uranium, and the quest for them and the riches they bring threatens a fragile ecosystem and the last of the forest Indians whose way of life goes back millenia. Most of the territory is unexplored, and studies of its mineral riches are mere estimates. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> declared the Amazonas region a federal reserve in 1972, off limits to all economic development projects. But, in apparent contradiction of the laws, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, the nation's capital, has granted concessions to some miners operating inside the territory's three national parks and other concessions to gold buyers. At the same time, the Ministry of the Environment has been accused of catering to `` developmentalists,'' those who would like to see <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> reap economic benefits from its land. Environmentalists complained in January when the government of then-President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Guayana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venezuela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> the rights to begin development projects in mining and other industries in previously virgin Amazonas. The corporation, known by its Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> CVG </ORGANIZATION>, is a state entity that has monopolized iron, aluminum and gold exploitation in nearby <LOCATION> Bolivar </LOCATION> state in southeastern <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> government's decree gives <ORGANIZATION> CVG </ORGANIZATION> power to move Indians from their villages when deemed necessary and it has even asked Indian leaders to work with it in cataloguing the region's potential riches. The <ORGANIZATION> CVG </ORGANIZATION> plans to create extensive mining zones and rubber tapping plantations, claims <PERSON> Aida </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Caracas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Amazonas Project.'' Under the project students travel by river canoe into remote Indian villages to spend months as part of their training in medicine, anthropology, biology and other specialties. <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> maintains that the <ORGANIZATION> CVG </ORGANIZATION>'s development plans would create in Amazonas another `` Kilometer 88,'' an infamous strip of malaria-and vice-ridden gold mines in Bolivar state. <ORGANIZATION> CVG </ORGANIZATION> denies that it plans unbalanced development of the region, saying it will incorporate environmental impact reports into its plans. However, <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> said: `` Any plans for exploitation of the Amazonas are not justified. The resources are non-renewable, and their exploitation is not worth the human sacrifice, and the extinction of fauna and flora we have not even begun to study.'' But the concerns of environmentalists may have become known too late. Signs in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, the capital of the territory with a population of 40,000 along the <LOCATION> Orinoco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, already advertise to buy gold. Indians have moved to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> from their forest homes and roam the streets at night after frequenting drinking establishments. Much of the mining in the territory's national parks, especially in <LOCATION> Yapacana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> at the confluence of the <LOCATION> Orinoco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventuari </LOCATION> rivers, is done by Indians, generally of the <LOCATION> Piaroa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Guajibo </PERSON> ethnic groups, said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Indians usually use rudimentary mining techniques, such as picks and shovels and sieves,'' he said. `` But the ` creoles' -LRB- Venezuelans of mixed blood -RRB- who travel down to barter gold usually rip them off. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> added that in addition to exploiting the Indian miners, outsiders were using mercury to extract gold from riverbeds, poisoning the water and causing extensive damage to wildlife and the Indians themselves. Roman Catholic missionaries in the southeast of the territory, home to roughly 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Yanomami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> who also inhabit areas of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, recently blamed gold miners for the deaths by mercury poisoning of some 100 <ORGANIZATION> Yanomami </ORGANIZATION> children. An invasion of about 3,000 Brazilian gold wildcatters into the Venezuelan <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> at the headwaters of the Orinoco created a public outcry in April. The Brazilians were eventually airlifted by Venezuelan and Brazilian military craft back to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, but not before they caused extensive damage to the headwaters. The Brazilians dredged riverbeds and cut down all vegetation within 600 feet of the river. Scientists estimated the damage would take hundreds of years to repair. The public outrage, not only over the environmental damage but the assault on national `` sovereignty,'' led for calls for the creation of a national park along the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parima </LOCATION> and the headwaters of the <LOCATION> Orinoco </LOCATION>, and the use of national guard troops and student volunteers to man the park system in <LOCATION> Amazonas </LOCATION>.

 The moment the elevator door opened, <PERSON> Clareise </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> sensed the danger. She sidestepped a mound of garbage and shone a light into the basement corners. `` We do n't want to stay here too long,'' she said. She tiptoed in, and immediately found evidence: fresh rat droppings. Over there, she said, spotlighting two holes in the floor. `` Rat burrows.'' And there, a dead rat. `` Nasty,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` Very nasty.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, poking into dank places in the largely toney <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> this day, is one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 22 rat inspectors. Rats live in every area of the city, surviving off abandoned food from the slums and in the sewers to the swanky suites and Strawberry Fields of Central Park. No one has taken a census, but a conservative count puts the rat population at one for each of the city's 8 million human residents. Some experts say it may be as high as four or five rats per person. The numbers indicate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is a rat paradise, and those whose job is to rid the city of the nocturnal rodents agree. That does n't mean the rat killers have n't made progress. Three hundred rat bites are recorded annually now, but that's down from about 750 a year two decades ago. The rat control program has won praise from experts, and officials from cities in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have come here for training. `` The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> program, for all of the problems that come with large cities, has one of the finest targeted urban rat control programs in the nation,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershovitz </PERSON>, a public-health administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, who worked with city rat control programs before federal funds for them were cut several years ago. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeples </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s pest control director, calls himself a `` professional killer, a hit man.'' `` I kill rats,'' he said in his deep baritone. `` The four-legged kind.'' <PERSON> Peeples </PERSON> oversees about 1,000 full - and part-time workers and a budget of $ 10 million a year The youthful 65-year-old has held nearly every position in the division. His crusade started about 25 years ago when as a health inspector he went on a call to a rundown <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> apartment. `` This small, innocent child had been bitten by a rat on his wrist,'' he said. `` Something all of a sudden hit me. I decided I was going to do something about this.'' He transferred to the pest control division, which had just formed, and over the years his expertise grew until he knew a lot about rats _ and about people. `` I hate to concede the fact that rats are smart. It really bothers me,'' he said in a recent interview. `` The other part of this problem is that people are dumb.'' Some people unknowingly do their best to fatten rats, he said in his sparsely furnished office, a poster of well-fed rats behind him. `` From seven o'clock to 11 o'clock at night, it's a rat's holiday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` That's the major TV time, and people all over this city rush home, make dinner, and go to the living room to watch TV. `` In the meantime, rats are in the kitchen, having their dinner,'' <PERSON> Peeples </PERSON> said. `` If you have steak for dinner, the rat has steak for dinner. And if you leave your food out overnight, well, you are just inviting the rat for breakfast.'' <PERSON> Peeples </PERSON> marvels at the abilities of his nemesis. Rats can walk up the sides of buildings. Rats can swim `` better than <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitz </PERSON> in his prime.'' Rats can gnaw through concrete. They also gnaw at electrical wires, setting off fires. Rats ruin fabrics, contaminate food and transmit a variety of diseases through bites and through fleas they carry. The rodents _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has mostly <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> rats and black rats _ generally live about a year, producing up to seven litters that average eight to 12 young each. Rats are savvy in sniffing out poisons. They often travel in packs, and when one finds a trap, it will urinate on the bait and sound warnings. Others develop immunities. This apparently happened in the mid-1970s in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. The surviving breed was called `` Super Rat.'' <PERSON> Peeples </PERSON> switched poisons, and Super Rat fell. His division focuses on prevention by educating people to put food away and patch holes in walls. But it also reacts to rat complaints by sending out inspectors, extermination teams and cleanup crews. Negligent landlords are billed for cleanup costs. <PERSON> Clareise </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> sent the landlord a summons following her tour of the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> basement, where a sign read: `` If you do n't want MICE, please put garbage in cans.'' Garbage sprawled underneath. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who has never been bitten by a rat, stayed only a few minutes, long enough to see the dead rat. Fleas and mites can jump off dead rats onto any warm body nearby, she said. `` Let's get out of here.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gather round the electronic campfire, buckaroos, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will show you a preview tonight of its new Old West series about the gallant lads of the <ORGANIZATION> Pony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Young Riders.'' On second thought, read a good western instead, maybe something like `` He Rode Tall in the Saddle Until His Blisters Broke.'' For tonight's `` The Young Riders'' _ the series starts its regular Thursday night run tomorrow _ is so mundane and cliche-ridden that teen-agers who see it may say, `` So this is how the West was wan.'' Occasionally exhibiting beautiful sunrises and sunsets, it purports to tell how the Pony Express dashed the mail by horseback from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. This was back in the halcyon days before fax machines ruined everything. Our young riders _ only orphans need apply as riders _ risk hostile Indians, brigands, the elements and <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> families to get the mail through. They are five in number, and the show centers on `` The Kid,'' a decent, rugged sort essayed by <PERSON> Ty </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The others are a varied lot. One swaggers, is tough and eager to use his pistol. Another is a halfbreed; he wears an earring. Another can hear but ca n't speak due to a childhood disease that left him bald. For history buffs, there's even a <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>, who in later years would make a living in touring Wild West shows. Here, he is so cocky that <PERSON> Teaspoon </PERSON>, the grizzled old plainsman who is teaching survival skills to the new riders, is moved to ask, `` You think you're pretty hot stuff, do n't you?'' `` Yup,'' young <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Teapoon </PERSON> fixes him with a steady gaze. `` Cowpies,'' he sneers. Well, even though the fine actor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerbe </PERSON> plays Teaspoon, this retort indicates a minor flaw in the show, such as an awful script. An awful script sometimes means there will be more of the same, which does not bode well for the future of this series. True, there is a tiny surprise in tonight's premiere. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON>, the fifth young rider, proves in one regard to be in violation of Pony Express rules, which prompts The Kid to warn: `` You wo n't fool people forever.'' True, the plot traditions of the Old West are attempted here. The regulars include the handsome town marshal -LRB- <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON> -RRB- who is sweet on a lovely lady -LRB- <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> -RRB- who is sort of the young riders' den mother. And tonight's show does have two <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> staples </LOCATION>, a band of heartless villains, led by a man with rotten teeth and a scar on his face, and a rousing chase scene involving hostile Indians. But there is no way any of this can work in a show that not only has hostile Indians foiled by firecrackers, but also a grizzled, hard-bitten plainsman who says `` Cowpies.''

 On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will preview `` Free Spirit,'' a Sunday sitcom about a harried, freshly divorced dad -LRB- Franc Luz -RRB- coping with three kids, his law practice and a bubbly young witch -LRB- <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohrer </PERSON> -RRB- who becomes the kids' new housekeeper and best friend. Only the kids know she's a witch, of course. In case you're wondering, yes, Old Dad will become attracted to her, and vice versa I do n't know if `` Spirit'' should be called `` Bewitched: The Sequel.'' But, like `` The Young Riders,'' the opening show, dealing with bowling and character introductions, has a script that gives lame a bad name. You get the feeling this newcomer is in trouble when, at the start of the show, <PERSON> Luz </PERSON>' teen-age daughter complains to Old Dad that her teen-age brother told one of her classmates `` that I used to be a Siamese twin.'' The laugh track chuckles, but I fear <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wo n't.

<HEAD>Refinance The House?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Indications from around the country show many homeowners still anxious to exchange variable rate mortgages for fixed-rate loans, even if the numbers might not add up. For many people, they really do n't. Is it worthwhile for you to dump your existing mortgage in order to save two percentage points? Even if the lower rate cuts your monthly payments by enough to allow you to put money in the bank or go out once or twice a month? Maybe not, even if your friends, financial counselor, neighbors and spouse say go ahead. If you do, be sure you know the cost, the length of time you'll be keeping the mortgage, and a lot about your local market. 1. To refinance usually means a fee of 1 percent or 2 percent of the total mortgage, and sometimes as much 3 percent. These are points, but seldom are they the only charge. The additional charges might include origination, application, appraisal, legal and other fees. In some instances they can add another 1.5 percent of the mortgage amount. If so, your upfront total is then 3.5 points. The cost of these fees should make you think again, especially if you are remortgaging to lower your interest charges by just one or two percentage points. The charges might be heftier than the savings. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offers this formula to clarify your thinking: _ Add the points being charged by the lender to the total amount of fees, expressed in points Two points plus another 1.5 points for fees is your total upfront cost. _ Determine the difference between the interest rate you are now paying and the rate being offered If you are paying 11.5 percent currently and have the opportunity for a new rate of 9.5 percent -LRB- unlikely -RRB-, your answer is 2. _ Divide that 2, or whatever number applies, into the total points The answer will be the number of years required for you to break even _ that is, to pay off the points. Thereafter, you are ahead of the game. But up to that point you are behind. If you were saving just one percentage point of interest, and your total points was 3.5, it would take you 3.5 years to break even. If you were paying 4.5 points, it would take you about 4.5 years to break even. 2. These factors have special meanings, depending on the owner's age and likelihood of remaining in the house Relatively few people pay off mortgages. At times, the average mortgage has had a life span of just seven years. 3. All this should be considered in relation to what's happening in your local market, not just on what you hear about national averages. Prices vary from one neighborhood to another, interest rates from one city to another. Never forget that real estate markets are cyclical. More so than almost any other segment of the economy, they have ups and downs. If your area is down and likely to fall further, then interest rates might also fall, even if only by a fraction of a point. More importantly, your lender might become friendlier, perhaps even knocking off one full point. Try to get a feel for what might happen nationally too. If you think rates will fall, you might consider delaying your refinancing. The opposite, of course, also applies: Act quickly if you're not likely to get better terms. These factors are extremely important in determing whether to stay with a variable rate mortgage or transfer to a fixed. If rates rise, your fixed loan does n't. If rates fall, you remain at the higher rate. And vice versa. Finally, the best deal might be with your current lender. Lenders do n't like to lose good customers. Conceivably, they might make you an offer you can not refuse.

 Even in a city where titanic deals are fairly ordinary, the one the <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> talent agency cut for itself on `` The Cosby Show'' was a whopper. For simply introducing <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> to the show's producers, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> negotiated a contract bringing the agency 10 percent of every dollar `` The Cosby Show'' generates, a windfall in excess of $ 100 million since 1984. The pact dramatizes the power that agencies like <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> now wield in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, especially through packaging TV shows. With packaging, a longtime practice in the movie industry, agents deliver the key ingredients for a hit movie or TV series. However, packaging also sometimes provides agents with extravagant payments _ usually a percentage of a show's revenues _ for little more than introducing one agency client to a producer. For some, the practice smacks of artistic extortion, and those involved in making deals are reluctant to talk about it. `` It's <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> saying, ` Fellas, you wan na open a bar in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>? This is the deal: My beer. My laundry. My glasses. My bartender. My union. My trucks,''' said a top TV writer-producer who spoke on condition of anonymity. What bothers the production community is that package fees come from the production itself, taking away funds that could help make a better project. And for some producers, paying a package commission can mean the difference between profit and loss. `` I think -LRB- packaging -RRB- is absolutely the worst waste of money that you could possibly imagine,'' said writer-producer <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, one of the few who would allow his name to be used. `` I think it's an extortion ... and one of the worst abuses in this business.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, whose credits include the old TV series `` <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>,'' `` Bewitched'' and `` That Girl,'' recently signed a deal with <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to create TV and movie products. At one time, and occasionally today, television packaging represented a real service. A packaged show _ a Perry Como or <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> special, `` The <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> Show'' _ might have included a writer, a director, a star, other related talent and perhaps even advertisers, bookkeepers and lawyers. The movie business still represents an area in which packagers serve an essential role. For no extra fee _ no package commission _ agents bring together several clients to form an outstanding team. Such was the case with <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> and the cast of `` Platoon,'' and the recent `` Mississippi Burning'' and `` Rain Man.'' Network executives say privately that as much as they despise television packaging, they are reluctant to do anything about it because if one network stops the practice, another network will accept the deals. CBS, however, was so concerned about packaging fees that it held discussions during last year's writers strike to see whether the strike could be settled if packaging fees were abolished. The talks failed to result in any action. Several top producers maintain that the three top agencies _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> and ICM _ sometimes are interested more in negotiating big packaging commissions for themselves than in promoting their clients' careers or making good shows. `` There are a lot of deals that do n't get made that should have because somebody objects to a package commission,'' said one top TV executive. At least one TV executive has asked <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislators to address the package issue. But the Department of Industrial Relations, which regulates agents' fee schedules, does not determine package fee limits, said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The top agencies are privately held and declined to be interviewed. <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> operates with almost comical secrecy. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtzman </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION>'s business affairs department, would not even decline to be interviewed unless he could do so off the record. Thus, it is hard to pinpoint every packaged show. However, published reports suggest that `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Roseanne,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` Empty Nest,'' `` Beauty and the Beast'' and `` The Famous Teddy Z'' are just a few of the packaged shows now on the air. The packaged talent in most situation comedies is the writer-producer. But almost anybody can be packaged in a miniseries or movie. The payoffs can be tremendous. <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION>, more than any other agency in town, is rolling in money. To appreciate <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION>'s embarrassment of riches, consider the case of the <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> ficus tree: I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>, the famed architect who designed the agency's elaborate new office, selected <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION>'s huge tree from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grove and then shipped it to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for a year's acclimatization The privately held agency, representing more than 600 top clients like <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, grossed $ 65 million last year, and <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovitz </PERSON> himself made $ 10 million, according to the entertainment industry newsletter Show Biz News. By controlling so many leading actors, writers and directors, the superagents can cut deals pretty much on their own terms. Producers not willing to play along often find doors locked. Television and movie executives are convinced that anyone speaking publicly against the superagents will suffer greatly, perhaps kept from signing an agency's top talent. Those few agents who do grant interviews defend packaging, saying it provides a real service, often helping to create a hit show. `` It does n't need justification, because it works,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifkin </PERSON>, a founder of Triad Artists. `` When a network buys a show that's successful, they increase their revenues. ... And you've created that potential for them. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Migden </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Talent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION>, said package deals generate more work for actors, directors and writers. `` In order to get work for clients, agents began to think creatively about putting properties together.'' Without package fees, agents take a percentage commission _ usually 10 percent _ on their clients' paychecks, and no more. With packaging fees, agents charge from 6 percent to 10 percent on the total cost of each and every episode in a TV series. With a normal commission, for example, a writer paid $ 50,000 a week by a situation comedy would give his agent $ 5,000 a week. The packaged clients keep 100 percent of their checks. With a package deal on that sitcom costing $ 700,000 a week, the agent collects up to $ 70,000 weekly, plus up to 10 percent of everything the series makes in the fruitful syndication market. Producers are trapped by the package commission because networks will not buy shows unless they have the top talent usually covered by packages. If one producer refuses to pay a package fee, there is always another who will. `` The agencies are n't fools,'' said one television producer. `` They know if we need these things to make the programs we produce more noticeable ... they can extract a premium for that. `` The networks continue to ask only for the ` A' players. ... And the ` A' players are controlled by fewer and fewer agencies.''

 <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> has a $ 500 fingernail on her pinkie. It's 14 karat gold, 2 inches long and adorned with nine dangling charms. In a society so sated that its garbage provides meals for the homeless, `` nail art'' has become a multimillion-dollar business. Booths and salons are springing up as fast as the human nail can grow. `` When I was growing up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the only women who painted their nails red worked in brothels,'' says manicurist <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Garlow </PERSON>. Now, women seeking a genteel look can have cameos painted on their nails; the more showy can have diamonds or pearls drilled in. For just plain funky, there's no limit. One woman wanted bowling balls painted on her nails for the night of her local tournament. And after the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> won the Super Bowl in 1987, dozens of fans had the phone number of quarterback <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> painted onto all 10 nails _ toes too, in some cases. When <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s fiance asked her what stone she wanted for her engagement, she requested a three-carat diamond _ drilled into her nail. `` It'll still be on my finger,'' she says, asking that her last name be withheld. `` Now that women have become accepted in the work force and realize they do n't have to look like men, they use nail polish and art as accessories for their wardrobe. It makes them look well-groomed, dressed up,'' says <PERSON> Garlow </PERSON>. And not just women. <PERSON> Garlow </PERSON> recently painted art work on the nails of 20 3-year-olds as entertainment at a birthday party. `` You know, instead of playing pin the donkey.'' Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON>, also a manicurist, is adept at using an air brush and other art tools to create fancy nails despite her own 2-inch talons. The `` canvas'' for most of the art is an acryllic substance shaped into the form of nails to make the human nail longer and harder. A set of artificial nails costs anywhere from $ 40 to $ 75, and `` upkeep'' runs about $ 25 every two or three weeks. That's for just regular polishing and filing. Nail art runs the gamut of prices _ as little as $ 2 a nail for simple sparkles or foil paper, and as high as $ 2,000 for precious stones. Snails, a Florida-based nail art supply business, estimates its gross sales this year at about $ 1 million, says owner <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sortino </PERSON>. She recently moved her offices to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where nail art first gained fashion in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, expecting a business slump. Instead, her sales have tripled, she says. Ms. <PERSON> Sortino </PERSON> also exports her products to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and other far-flung spots. As in the case of many trends, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is frequently cited as the birthplace of nail art, but the ornate decoration actually is centuries-old. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, long nails were a mark of distinction setting the nobles apart from the working class. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, a top society hairdresser in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has a collection of custom-designed protectors used by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> women to guard their jewel-encrusted nails, which were sometimes grown to as much as one foot. <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, who used to do first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hair and nails, has judged a number of nail art competitions around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had nails so thin when she first came to the White House, `` you could read a newspaper through them,'' <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> says. But she refused artificial nails, opting for a nature-based nail-hardening treatment and subdued polish. The art competitions, held on local and national levels, are a chance to win thousands of dollars in prizes provided by cosmetics manufacturers to promote their products, says <PERSON> Jacquelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fashion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. She estimates nail industry sales around the country, including nail art, at $ 1.5 billion or more. Ms. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, who holds a degree in business administration and accounting from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, opened her nail salon four years ago. She constantly experiments with new designs, her latest discovery being hologram paper pasted onto nails in iridescent geometric patterns. Now, she's turning her attention to male nails. She already has noticed that many high school boys in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> paint art on their pinkies. Whether that will catch on with older men remains to be seen. But, she says, `` you do n't have to sacrifice your manhood to get artificial nails. A manicure does n't mean you're a sissy.''

 They worked together in the civil rights movement and share a faith that recognizes no racial boundaries, but <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s flock in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains largely divided into black and white sheep. Gains in integration in business, government and education have not been matched in the church, which some observers say may be the nation's most segregated institution. Why? `` Is n't it obvious? It's racism.

The segregation is even greater in the black churches. `` A fraction of a fraction of 1 percent'' is the estimated number of whites in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Officials in the 3 million-member African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> estimate one-tenth of 1 percent of its members are white. `` Sunday morning is the most segregated time in the country,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a white Presbyterian pastor who is co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said there is a profound difference between the teachings of Christianity and the way it adapts to the society around it. `` Religion more often than not serves to bolster our own identities. If we are at heart racist, and I believe at heart both blacks and whites are racist, then we ought not to be surprised that religion bolsters that,'' he said. The attempt by the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> to form an unauthorized parish for black Catholics in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is full of historical precedent. Introduced to Christianity through slavery, black Americans have for centuries moved away from predominantly white churches into churches they had more control over and felt comfortable in. Once criticized for serving as a barrier to blacks in their efforts to make gains in American society, the black church has enjoyed a resurgence since the late 1960s, when blacks and other ethnic groups began to question the value of assimilation and place greater reliance on institutions that preserved their heritage. `` In predominantly white groups, people of black heritage often feel like they're the invisible man. They're there, but not ever seen,'' said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, president of the Board of Bishops of the African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the solidarity many within predominantly white churches showed in the civil rights movement of a generation ago, the racism that caused the black church remains today, if in more subtle forms, according to black church leaders. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said black churches address the needs of black Americans, while many predominantly white churches embrace the status quo. For example, he said, `` Southern Baptists are hard-pressed to say anything against apartheid, hunger in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, racism among elected officials.'' Some officials in predominantly white churches contend black churches make exaggerated claims of racism because they are fearful of losing members to churches actively seeking to integrate their pews. The Southern Baptist Convention is on record as condemning apartheid, hunger and racism, said the Rev. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of that denomination's <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do not mean to imply we have arrived, for we have not,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` But we are not the old-school racist denomination of a generation ago.'' The black church also is not without its own debates on prejudice. In the African <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, for example, there is only one native bishop in the church's six episcopal districts in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Last year, the church elected three bishops to serve <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ all were from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> A.M.E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recorder </ORGANIZATION>, said church officials used to say African blacks were not qualified to be bishops. `` That is no longer true, and that would have been no longer true for decades,'' he said. Still, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, unlike some white churches, the doors of the black church have always been open. `` We've never had a closed-door policy as white Southern Baptists, southern Methodists, Presbyterians have had. We've been the ones rejected and turned away,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. But officials at the nation's largest churches say there has been some movement toward integration. In the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, which split from northern Baptists in the 1840s because of its defense of slavery, six state conventions have elected black presidents, and among Protestant churches, `` we put more money into the black community than any other denomination today, period,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricks </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> and Race of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said her denomination is giving blacks greater leadership roles. For example, while approximately 4 percent of the church members are black, 10 of the church's 49 active bishops are black. As the estimated number of black Catholics has more than doubled from 900,000 to 2 million in 20 years, the church has established a national Office for Black Catholics. Deacon <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a black clergyman from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, recalled his Baptist grandfather telling him, `` Catholicism is the church that's going to take a mule to heaven.'' But he stayed within the church, and eventually sought his vocation there. `` I was searching for something all my life. I love the church. The roots of the church go back to my grandmother and mother,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. When he was deciding whether to become a deacon, what impressed him was that `` there was an openness, a reception, and my status as being black did n't matter.''

 In <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, people drink to get drunk, not too often but with gusto. As one authority says, it's part of the `` northern culture.'' The governments of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> try to control the consumption of alcohol by making it expensive, and in the process are making a lot of money.

 The crowds begin to gather at noon on Friday. By 3 p.m. customers are spilling into the street. By closing time at 6 p.m. the waiting lines run into the hundreds as people try to buy their weekend ration of wine, beer or hard liquor at the state-run store. It's not a matter of shortage, but of government attempts to make drinking difficult _ and to make a lot of money in the process. `` Swedes have a hedonistic way of drinking,'' says <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klette </PERSON>, a law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Lund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's part of the northern culture.'' <PERSON> Bjorn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Swedish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> and Other Drugs, says: `` We drink in the Scandinavian way _ not too often, but a lot. We drink more to get intoxicated than in other countries.'' Though Scandinavian governments try to control the consumption of alcohol, at the same time they profit from it through taxes that boost the price to the consumer to 10 times the cost. In <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, alcohol is sold legally only in state stores at government-set prices. Only the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has a similar system in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Prices are meant to be prohibitive. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> raised liquor prices twice last year to discourage heavy drinkers, pushing up the cost of a bottle of scotch to $ 36.40. Sales dipped briefly, but quickly returned to normal. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s parliament is considering legislation to reduce the level of alcohol tolerated for drivers to virtually nil. The legal limit in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> already is lower than in most of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, at 0.05 percent alcohol in the blood. Courts in the three countries link fines for drunken driving to an offender's income. A Norwegian lawyer set the record this year after failing a breath test in a spot road check: He was fined $ 16,000. Compared with other countries, alcohol consumption per person is low. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> rates 26th in the world, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is 31st and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is 33rd. But Scandinavians rarely have a casual glass of wine with dinner, a cold beer to quench a hot thirst or a pre-dinner aperitif. `` A small percentage of the people, maybe 10 percent, drink about half the alcohol sold,'' <PERSON> Hibell </PERSON> says. Drinking is ingrained in national customs, from the protocol of a formal evening party to the celebrations of Crayfish Day, which falls on Aug. 10. On that day, Swedes wear party hats, tie red napkins below their chins, sing boisterous drinking songs and plunder a bowl of the small lobster-like shellfish. Custom dictates that each claw is washed down with a glass of schnapps. About 20 crayfish make a meal. The culture of alcohol may have its origins in the chilly climate and the long, dreary winters. The vikings were said to have an affinity for mead and other strong drink. Some social observers say the normally shy Scandinavians need alcohol to open up. As early as the 18th century, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> saw liquor as a main source of income, and urged drinking as an act of patriotism. In the 19th century, Swedish companies often paid their workers in booze. Excessive drinking led to a powerful temperance movement, now 150 years old. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> imposed rationing in 1917, limiting men to three liters of spirits a month, and less for women. Ration books lasted until 1955. Prohibition was introduced in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, with as little success as it had in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Today, advertising alcoholic beverages is forbidden. Unlike other stores, liquor outlets are closed evenings and weekends. `` The idea is that alcohol should n't be too available or too cheap,'' <PERSON> Hibell </PERSON> says. The cheapest scotch is sold in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> at $ 24 for a fifth, and for $ 32 in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, a bottle of good 12-year-old scotch is now up to $ 60. Tight regulation on liquor supplies created an underground market for moonshine. In <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, police arrested two men last March who claimed to be horse breeders, but who were accused of building stills in their stalls producing 1,000 liters a day. Figures published in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> say about 10 percent of the alcohol sold is moonshine. Swedish statistics say 3,274 people died in 1986 from alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver and other diseases in which alcohol was a probable factor. That figure compares with 1,256 alcohol-related deaths in 1965. About 9 percent of fatal traffic accidents are linked to drinking, according to figures compiled by <PERSON> Hibell </PERSON>'s organization. There is some evidence of a long-term improvement. Surveys of drinking habits among conscripted soldiers show that those who reported getting drunk at least several times a month dropped from 68 percent in 1971 to 42 percent in 1987. The willingness to drink at any price means enormous tax income for the governments. In 1987, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> earned 8.5 percent of its national budget from its alcohol tax, almost enough to pay its entire health care bill, including medical research. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> reckoned on $ 1.31 billion in alcohol revenue in its 1989 budget, and plowed back $ 8.6 million to fight alcoholism. Of the $ 24 a Swede pays for a bottle of whisky, the state-owned importer takes $ 1.46 for buying, bottling, labeling and distributing the drink to the retailer. The state-owned retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Systembolaget </ORGANIZATION>, takes 93 cents. The rest, $ 21.61, is tax. Drinking habits are changing, largely due to government efforts steering people away from the brutally strong locally distilled spirits and vodkas to wine and beer. `` We have become a wine-drinking country in the last 10 years,'' says <PERSON> Goran </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandberg </PERSON>, a director of the Wine and <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s state-owned importer. `` We have grown up gastronomically.'' As the sole importer for an entire nation, the company wields power in the wine-making world far outstripping <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s comparative size. The Swedes helped establish Australian vineyards, buying half the wine exports of that country on the opposite side of the globe. The company boasts being the world's largest customer of wine, importing 100 million liters a year from 27 countries. The wine is stored in caverns originally built for the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> as bomb shelters.

 For <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, this week's education summit with the nation's governors provides a unique opportunity to redeem a campaign pledge to become `` the education president.'' But the meeting could also leave him vulnerable to blame for the failings of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools as no president has ever been. By convening the governors for only the third time in the nation's history, the president has raised expectations that under his leadership the country will find ways to remedy persistent shortcomings in its schools. Most of the meetings at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> on Wednesday and Thursday will take place behind closed doors. The White House says the governors wanted it that way. `` We're going to have some roll-up-your-sleeve meetings,'' said the president, who wants the summit to produce `` new ideas that can help us develop national educational goals and objectives.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools are `` not making the grade,'' complained <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, citing a recent comparison of 13-year-olds in a dozen countries that placed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students last in math and near the bottom in science. `` We're spending more money on education than most other countries, and frankly getting less in terms of our investment,'' he told reporters last week. `` The educational system is basically well-fed, but it's undernourished,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` We must find innovative, accountable ways to improve performance.'' The first time a president summoned the states' chief executives to a summit was in 1908, when <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> brought them together to discuss how to conserve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s natural resources; the second time was in 1933, when <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> sought their advice on the Great Depression. By investing this session with the stature of a summit, the president has aroused hopes that, as <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> put it, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will `` assume some personal responsibility for the future of the quality of education.'' `` Once you pick up this ball, you pretty well got to run with it. If you try to put it down after the summit's over, then I think you have dashed expectations, disappointed people, a divided country,'' said <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, a Democrat who tried but failed to increase taxes this year to raise teacher salaries. Apart from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s education secretary, <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, no educators will take part in the deliberations, and the governors have been instructed to bring just one aide each to the table. Unlike a superpower summit or the annual economic parlay of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and its allies, the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> meeting will not be propelled by legions of striped-pants aides toiling behind the scenes to agree on accords in advance for the political leaders to ratify. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears intent on hearing first-hand testimony from the governors _ many of them veterans of battles over school reform in their states _ on which ideas hold the most promise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already indicated his interest in hearing success stories on how to recruit and keep teachers, how to keep drugs and crime out of schools and how to give parents more choice over which public school their child attends. Eventually, the president will propose new education goals for the nation, not at the end of this summit but at a later date, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before him, has been an enthusiastic backer of efforts in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and elsewhere to give parents more choice in public education. The rationale is that public schools will be put on their mettle if forced to compete for students instead of relying on a neighborhood monopoly. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also backs expanded aid for magnet schools, which strive for excellence through academic specialties. The president has lauded <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s successful experiment with an alternative certification program that allows non-education majors into the teaching profession. Virtually every state has raised graduation standards since the scorching 1983 report `` A Nation At Risk,'' written by a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration panel, and teacher salaries have spurted ahead faster than inflation. But American pupils still lag behind their counterparts in other industrialized nations on virtually every international study. Scores have stagnated on college entrance tests. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>' a schools are beset with drug and dropout problems unheard of in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which graduates nearly all of its teen-agers from high school. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a public television documentary last spring, said he viewed the three most pressing problems facing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools as `` drugs, drugs and drugs.'' The federal budget deficit makes it difficult for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to promise major resources to carry out education initiatives. He sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on April 5 a modest $ 441 million package of proposed additions to the Education Department's nearly $ 22 billion budget. More than half the requested money _ $ 250 million _ would go to create a Presidential Merit Schools awards program, providing cash grants to top schools. In addition, $ 100 million would be earmarked for magnet schools. The proposal has made little headway on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, although the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week passed a small component: scholarships for math and science majors who become teachers. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> summit is just `` the beginning'' of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts to begin a national dialogue on education. But after six years of school reform and literally scores of reports ruminating on what is wrong with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools, many educators are impatient for results. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, warns, `` It will be a terrible letdown and a waste if the summit deals with trivialities, if ... symbolism is all the president has in mind, and the education summit turns out to be just another media event.''

 Japanese automakers are still producing the most fuel-efficient cars _ tiny compacts getting up to 55 miles per gallon _ while the list of `` gas guzzlers'' is dominated by expensive, luxurious European models, government fuel economy figures indicate. The vehicle mileage survey, released Monday, was based on industry and government tests on all 1990 model cars, trucks and vans and showed little change over the previous year.

<HEAD>Sony Chairman Says Trade Imbalance Caused by ``Attractiveness'' of
Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The trade imbalance between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is caused by the difference in `` attractiveness'' of the nations' goods, not price, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> told world business executives. `` The answer does not lie in protection for high-tech industries,'' <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> said Monday. `` Protectionism runs counter to free market principles and, with the lack of external competition, would only encourage inefficient industries, which are unable to market their products outside of their protected market. `` The real key to competitiveness,'' he said, `` lies not in trade policy but in such areas as increasing investment, strengthening commercial R & amp; D and above all, increasing the quality and spirit of the labor force.'' <PERSON> Akio </PERSON>, speaking to 500 business leaders from 62 countries attending the International Industrial Conference, said investments in improving industrial competitiveness must be viewed as a long-term proposition. `` Perhaps my most basic message is that both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations should shift their time horizons,'' he said. `` Investments are needed today that will pay dividends in 10, 20 or 30 years.'' <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> also said `` international trade is now being shaken by emotional politicization of the trade imbalance.'' `` I must say that the politicians and governments around the world are not sufficiently aware of the reality of an ever-developing global-scale economy or a borderless economy,'' he said. `` The borderless economy has developed in such a speed and scale exceeding our foresight and imagination.'' Noting the foreign exchange involving billions of dollars, yen and German marks, he said imports and exports of tangible goods are not the only items that generate big money. Intellectual properties, such as patents, know-how and music, also are valuable, he said. `` In my view, bilateral trade is made up of numerous ` buy and sell' transactions between companies in the two nations. An imbalance is the difference in the sum of these transactions over a given time.'' It is important to Americans and the world economy that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry regain its competitiveness, he said. Later, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communities </ORGANIZATION>, discussed the effort to remove trade barriers between European Community nations by 1992. <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> said he saw no reason that the deadline for achieving a single market would not be reached, despite difficulties in coming to agreement on the automotive, transportation, energy, and telecommunications industries. `` In those four fields the antagonisms between the nations are very destructive, and the interests of firms and the interests of nations are mixed,'' he said. `` I must spend all my time to convince the 12 governments to fulfill the single market and to not accept exceptions ... because the advantage of a single market is enormous in those sectors.'' <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> provoked nervous laughter among the executives when he responded to a question about whether Europeans would develop different trade policies for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` It depends on the Japanese and the Americans,'' he said. `` For example, when I explain the process of reciprocity to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessmen, they understand. They are very positive about the concept. Unfortunately, when I explain this global concept to Japanese, it is more difficult to have an understanding. `` And frankly, we must be very tough with the negotiations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` because it is very difficult for us, our businesses, our banks, to penetrate the Japanese market.'' The remark drew scattered laughs and light applause from the audience, which included dozens of Japanese _ among them <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, who chaired the proceedings and introduced <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>. `` Excuse me, but it is a matter of fact,'' <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> said to more nervous laughter. When <PERSON> Delors </PERSON> left the podium, <PERSON> Morita </PERSON> thanked him for his remarks and added, `` I promise you to make Japanese easier to understand.''

<HEAD>Sell-Off in Junk Bonds Could Be Blessing in Disguise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last week's sharp sell-off in the junk bond market could be a blessing in disguise for the economy by making it more difficult for companies to take on much more of the high-cost debt, some analysts say. By scaring off investors, the plunge in junk bonds could make it nearly impossible for companies to sell new junk issues unless there is a strong likelihood they are able to make payments on it over the long run, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON>, senior economist for <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't continue to leverage forever. There has to be some end to what's taking place, and sooner is better than later,'' <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON> said Monday. Issuers of junk bonds _ are high-interest-rate debt securities often used by companies with poor credit ratings _ must pay high interest rates to attract investors. In recent years, the securities have been widely used for such ventures as mergers and acquisitions. But if the economy sours, issuers could be forced to default, adding to the economy's troubles. Quoted bids for junk bonds stabilized Monday after last week's sell-off, although analysts said trading in the most speculative issues nearly ground to a halt `` People feel it's too late to sell and too early to buy,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> B. Front, an economist at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Farnham </LOCATION>. A cash crunch at <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> retailing giant, triggered last week's price plunge, carrying down even relatively secure issues. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> conditionally agreed Friday to loan <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> $ 250 million in a deal that was expected to give the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> developer greater influence over <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s management and a greater ownership stake After being carried downward by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s problems, the higher-grade junk bonds such as <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiberglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> were quoted as much as -RCB- point higher Monday. A point equals $ 10 on a bond with a face value of $ 1,000. Meanwhile, the bid on one issue of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unit was quoted down slightly to 26 cents on the dollar from 27. But with bond owners not willing to offer the issue at less than 35 cents, there was virtually no trading, market participants said. The bid for <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> bonds rose 10 to 55, but was still well below the asking price of 65. Companies that were planning to issue junk bonds in coming weeks might postpone or restructure their offerings because of the sell-off, which pushed up yields and made financing more expensive, <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON> said. If wary investors demand higher and higher interest on junk bonds, companies may be less able to rely on the low-grade securities for financing. They then may either pull back from speculative, riskier ventures or finance them in a less risky way, such as by issuing stock. The economy is approaching the seventh birthday of the longest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peacetime expansion in history. But some economists say it may not last much longer. <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Janeway </PERSON>, in a column in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, warned that dangerously high levels of inventories are accumulating in autos, housing, retailing and metals. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchan </PERSON>, in a column in Monday's editions of the London-based Financial Times, said the shakeout in junk bonds is the latest phase of a `` rolling liquidation'' that in past years had wrung speculation out of agriculture and the energy markets. `` The secret is to shake out the speculators in batches not, as in the 1920s, all together,'' <PERSON> Buchan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, publisher of <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s Interest Rate Observer, said he believed <PERSON> Buchan </PERSON>'s assessment seemed on target. `` It's always good news when false values are exposed for being false,'' he said in an interview.

<HEAD>Harbert Offers $385 Million for Birmingham Steel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday offered about $ 385 million for <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, a 5-year-old company that prospered by buying older, often financially troubled steel mills at bargain prices. <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said the decision to sell the company to Birmingham-based <PERSON> Harbert </PERSON> stemmed in part from a desire to keep its headquarters in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. `` We have had a number of people express an interest in buying out the company,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Harbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 30 a share in cash, or a total of about $ 385 million for the company's stock. <PERSON> Harbert </PERSON>, an international construction company, also would assume and refinance more than $ 100 million in <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> debt. The company's stock closed Monday at $ 29.12 -LCB-, up $ 4.50, in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of about $ 39 million in its latest fiscal year on sales of more than $ 343 million. <ORGANIZATION> Harbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was founded by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbert </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a major <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> investor. A special committee of outside directors, formed by the company to study a possible sale, recommended the <PERSON> Harbert </PERSON> offer after determining there was little room for the stock's price to move above the low $ 20s. The price has been depressed because of <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s 50 percent investment in redevelopment of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, rolling mill, which eventually will make flat-rolled sheet steel. <PERSON> Harbert </PERSON>, chairman of the company, said <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s success and strong management team prompted him to make the offer. He already owns less than 5 percent of the company's stock and sits on its board of directors. `` We are knowledgable about this industry,'' he said. The offer must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> stockholders.

<HEAD>Datacrime Virus Scares Computer Owners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rare data-destroying computer virus that will attack personal computers after Oct. 12 is causing consternation among computer owners who fear they will be among its relatively small number of victims. Computer security firms and companies that supply anti-viral software say they have been deluged by calls since word of the `` Datacrime'' virus was spread widely last week by the news media. `` Frankly, the virus is n't all that important a virus, yet this phone is ringing off the hook,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, a New Yorker who makes a virus protector called Flu-Shot Plus, said late last week. `` The alarms that are going off absolutely staggered me,'' said <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartau </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. He said several government agencies and Fortune 500 companies had contacted him about the virus. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said he has received maybe a half-dozen reports of the virus since it surfaced earlier this year. The Computer Virus Industry Association of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has received seven reports, chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McAfee </PERSON> said Monday. In contrast, there have been thousands of reports of other viruses. Far more people will be hit on Oct. 13 by the less harmful but more widespread <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> virus, also known as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or Friday the 13th virus. `` I'm more worried about spilling a cup of coffee on my keyboard than I am about the Datacrime virus,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. Computer viruses are pieces of software written by anonymous programmers that make copies of themselves and spread from one machine to another through infected floppy disks, office networks or phone links such as computer bulletin boards. The Datacrime virus attacks the hard disk data-storage devices of IBM-compatible personal computers that use <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s MS-DOS operating system. It wipes out the directory section, making it impossible for the disk's contents to be read. The virus is triggered when an infected program is used anytime after the computer's internal clock passes Oct. 12, the traditional date for Columbus Day. It is also known as the Columbus Day or Icelandic virus. The virus was found lying dormant in computers by people who noticed that some of their programs had swollen inexplicably. Infected programs were turned over to experts who dismantled the virus and found out how it worked and when it would be triggered. Computer security experts say the best thing computer users can do to protect themselves from the Datacrime or any other virus is to make backup copies every day of everything they want to save. `` People should make backups the way they brush their teeth in the morning, like a basic part of hygiene,'' <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. Users can limit their exposure to viruses by staying away from bootleg software while being cautious in their use of computer bulletin boards and networks. But viruses have even been found in new, store-bought software in a few rare instances. Several companies make software that scans programs for known viruses, but those scanners wo n't pick up viruses they do n't recognize Other programs stop a machine cold and alert the user when a program tries to do something unauthorized, such as writing on an off-limits portion of the hard disk. The latest versions allow users to `` teach'' them to give fewer false alarms, which can be a major annoyance. Once an infected program is found, the usual course is to erase it and write over it with zeroes so it ca n't be resurrected by a clever programmer. Some companies say they can delete a virus while saving the infected program, while others say that approach is unreliable. `` It's absolutely impossible for anybody to say we have a fix for this,'' said <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. PC Magazine earlier this year gave its top ratings to <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>'s Flu-Shot Plus, a $ 10 program distributed through computer bulletin boards, and Certus from <ORGANIZATION> FoundationWare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, which costs $ 189 The small group of people making virus detection or eradication software also includes <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Interpath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Glath </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> RG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate whether the government has leaked confidential information to the press about its case against indicted financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said Monday she would not hold a hearing on the leak allegations made by defense lawyers until after <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s trial, so as not to heighten publicity in the racketeering and fraud case. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s lawyers last week asked <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> to order the government to halt a `` constant stream'' of press leaks they claimed threatened the right to a fair trial for the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond division. `` We're very pleased with the court's decision to direct an investigation into the alleged leaks,'' <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Flumenbaum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, who is presiding over the case, directed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> to examine the alleged leaks by government officials. She also requested private periodic reports on the probe. But <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> also said there was no basis in the record for the contention that the alleged leaks could only have come from government sources. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> was first named in news reports as the government's main target shortly after now-jailed speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation of widespread Wall Street corruption in late 1986. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> provided much of the information used to indict <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. Newspaper stories since then regularly have contained advance details of the government's investigation and indictment plans. Stories have appeared leading up to and containing the indictment date as well as the charges. The motion cited stories published in The Wall Street Journal, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and The Los Angeles Times. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s lawyers asked <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> to order the government to stop leaking confidential material, hold a hearing to identify the sources of the leaks, impose contempt sanctions on the leakers and make public a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> memo detailing confidential testimony in the case that recently was written about in the Post. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said the government had requested an investigation of the alleged leaks, which defense lawyers have protested regularly, before the motion was filed last Wednesday. The judge also said the government should instruct the grand jury in the case not to pay attention to any outside reports on the case, which prosecutors said they already had done. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, and former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> were charged in March in a 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment that alleges insider trading, securities violations and other crimes. They have pleaded innocent and a March 1990 trial is set.

<HEAD>Hertz Ends Participation In Airline Frequent-Flier Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it is pulling out of airline frequent-flier programs because the growth of mileage awards had made them too costly for the company. Other national car-rental concerns indicated they might follow the industry leader. But analysts said Monday that while the withdrawal of car-rental companies would make frequent-flier programs less attractive, it did not mean their demise. `` Anytime some feature of the program is eliminated it is less potent as a marketing tool,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Longman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But these programs are here to stay. They will just evolve a bit more.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest car-rental company, said the rate of growth of mileage points had doubled in each of the last two years. The value of the redeemed credits last year exceeded $ 15 million, said <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigby </PERSON>. `` The program has become very expensive to participate in,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rigby </PERSON> said. `` Double and triple mileage programs have become increasingly common in the last couple of years so the frequency of the awards has grown.'' Ms. <PERSON> Rigby </PERSON> said that because 60 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> customers are business travelers, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> feels it is giving incentives to people who likely would rent from the company anyway. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said it would end its participation with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> at the end of the year. Frequent fliers on these carriers will have until Dec. 31 to earn mileage for <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> coupons and will have until the end of 1990 to use the coupons, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> also plans to discontinue partnerships with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> as those contracts come up for renewal after Dec. 31, Ms. <PERSON> Rigby </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> initiated the frequent-flier program in 1981 in an effort to draw and keep customers. Other airlines soon followed. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> and other national car rental concerns as well as hotels joined with the airlines hoping to generate new business. Travelers in frequent-flier programs earn credits for miles they fly, nights they stay in hotels and each time they rent cars. Credits can be redeemed for free air travel, hotel stays and car rentals. But in recent years airlines have been cutting back on the programs because they were forced to give out too many free trips as the programs became popular. <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said it is having a similar problem. In addition, higher air fares this year have softened the car-rental business, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it is evaluating its own participation with frequent fliers in light of <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION>' move. `` Obviously they're expensive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Demetria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudar </PERSON>. `` This sheds a different light on things _ an industry leader making a major move.'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it also may have an announcement soon on its frequent-flier participation. `` We're taking a hard look at the <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> move,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, spokesman for National Car Rental. <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it is not currently considering dropping its frequent-flier partnerships. `` The frequent-flier program is very costly and by itself is not worth the cost,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smircich </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the airlines that we are participating with have been good to work for and our participation is not limited strictly to giving out mileage.''

<HEAD>S&amp;L Industry Still Largest Originator of Home Mortgages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite the savings and loan crisis, the thrift industry continues to be the largest originator of home mortgages, a government study reported. Thrifts retain the lead with 43 percent of single family mortgages and 46 percent of multifamily mortgages, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> study released Monday. Part of the thrift industry crisis was blamed on some savings and loans that engaged in risky investments such as speculative commercial real estate projects and junk bonds rather than home mortgages. The recently enacted savings and loan law, which authorized spending $ 50 billion to bail out the industry, requires thrifts to raise the level of housing and housing-related loans in their portfolios to 70 percent from the current 60 percent. S & amp; Ls have five years to phase out their risky ventures. Savings and loan companies were estimated to have held nearly $ 780 billion in mortgages at the end of 1988, 36 percent of the $ 2 trillion home mortgage market and only 4 percent less than their 1970 share, the study said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it is recalling nearly 493,000 Escorts and <ORGANIZATION> Mercury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynxes </ORGANIZATION> to fix faulty emission-control systems and 67,156 Tracers because of an apparent seat-belt defect. Repairs of either problem will be made at no charge regardless of a vehicle's age or mileage, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in separate statements. The vehicles recalled for emission-system improvements have 1.9-liter engines and include the 1985 Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx and the 1986 Escort, Lynx and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EXP </ORGANIZATION>. Excessive emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide were discovered during routine EPA tests of 1985 models, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. `` We're constantly checking various classes of vehicle to see if a few years after leaving the assembly line, they're still meeting standards,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> did n't request the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> recall but `` we sort of term these recalls EPA-influenced,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> attributed the problem to normal wear. `` A few years back, the equipment was not as good as it was now,'' <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said. `` Some of the valves and small hoses and pieces are starting to wear out and we're having to replace them with upgraded pieces.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> repairs will involve changing the choke system, distributor spark advance and the air-injection system, a pollution-control system that helps the catalytic converter control hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Dealers also will install more durable crankcase ventilation valves, also known as PCV valves, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Cars made for sale in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are excluded from the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> recall because they are manufactured to meet that state's emission standards, which are more stringent than <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s, <PERSON> Parris </PERSON> said. No <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cars have been found to fall short of the federal standards, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. The Tracers being recalled were made in the 1988 model year. There are 66,314 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 842 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. In some cases, it has become difficult to extend the front-seat lap-shoulder belts for buckling unless they are pulled very slowly, the company said. A few of the belts may lock and be impossible to pull out. Owners having trouble extending the belts are asked to return the car to the dealer for inspection and repairs if necessary, the automaker said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the publishing giant controlled by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, has agreed to buy the textbook concern <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> for $ 260 million in cash. The deal would swell <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s share of the educational publishing market, while enabling <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>'s owner, the privately-held <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Howell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to make a graceful retreat from that fiercely competitive business. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, publishes textbooks, software and other learning materials for the elementary, high school and college markets, and officials said it was expected to post more than $ 100 million in revenue this year. The company, founded in 1842, has been owned since 1967 by <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, which is based in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Herb </PERSON>, vice president-administration at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, said his company decided to sell <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> for strategic reasons He said consolidation in the educational publishing field put <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> at a competitive disadvantage with larger companies. He said <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> considered making some acquisitions in this field but found few potential candidates and decided several months ago to sell <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION>. The deal is subject to regulatory approval. `` We are extremely pleased to acquire this excellent publisher,'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> was quoted as saying in a two-sentence announcement of the deal. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> had told shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC last week at their annual meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the company was negotiating for a medium-sized educational publishing business in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> was acquired in May 1988 for $ 640 million by a group led by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and including senior management. Before that deal was completed, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> had indicated he was interested in pursuing <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> but never made a formal offer. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> subsequently paid $ 2.5 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>, which is a leading educational publisher and has a growing information services business. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> combined its elementary, secondary and vocational education publishing businesses with those of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a 50-50 joint venture called the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> continues to operate its own college textbook publishing business separately <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, president of the school division at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> expects to post more than $ 100 million in revenue this year, and employs about 650 people at three sites in the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> metropolitan area. The news release did not say how the Merrill operations would be combined with those of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>, and company spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> said she did now know what the plans were. But if <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>'s elementary and secondary school operations were combined with those of the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan-McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> joint venture, it would become the nation's second largest publisher for elementary and secondary schools, according to Educational Marketer, a trade newsletter from <ORGANIZATION> Knowledge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Educational Marketer estimated that <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> derived $ 70 million in revenue from elementary and secondary school publishing in 1988. That would lift the Macmillan-McGraw-Hill total for 1988 to $ 440 million, second only to $ 476.5 million at <ORGANIZATION> Harcourt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jovanovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In the nation's college publishing rankings, <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> ranks 10th at $ 58.3 million and the addition of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated $ 20 million to $ 25 million in 1988 revenue would leave the combined operation far behind the leader, <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster at $ 218.2 million in 1988, according to Educational Marketer. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> said the proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce part of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>'s debt of about $ 500 million and to finance internal growth of its remaining businesses, which include republishing databases and a mail handling operation.

 <ORGANIZATION> Questar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has joined with Canadian and Swiss firms to market a device that allows natural gas-powered vehicles to be refueled at home and other places where natural gas is available. B.C. Gas of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sulzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winterthur </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Questar </ORGANIZATION> have formed <ORGANIZATION> FuelMaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to develop, make and market the device, <ORGANIZATION> Questar </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday. The new company will be based in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> with offices in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. The compressor developed by <ORGANIZATION> Sulzer </ORGANIZATION> engineers connects directly to the natural gas supply at a customer's home or business. A small-diameter hose with a quick-disconnect coupling is used as the gas is boosted to the 3,000 pounds per square inch pressure needed to fill vehicles' natural gas fuel cylinders. Refueling can be done in about five hours, while the car is unattended, <ORGANIZATION> Questar </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The growing national and international interest in protecting the environment is creating a lot of interest in natural gas as a clean alternative to gasoline,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benefield </PERSON>, FuelMaker general manager. <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Questar </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that provides natural gas service in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and southwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, is converting 100 of its service vehicles to natural gas.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> plans to ask the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for a 90-day extension on payments to service its $ 110 billion debt because it can not meet its obligations, a high-ranking official of the country's central bank was quoted as saying. The Mexican government news agency quoted <PERSON> Wadico </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucchi </PERSON>, a governor of the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, as saying President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s administration is seeking to gain time in order to receive a $ 600 loan still pending from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> which will be used to service the debt. <PERSON> Bucchi </PERSON> said the loan is part of a credit-line the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> extended last year but which <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has not received yet. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> can not pay its creditors until it gets it. <PERSON> Bucchi </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> as saying he is sure the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will grant the 90-day extension when he meets Friday with officials of that organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is certain the great majority of creditor banks will respond positively to its petition,'' <PERSON> Bucchi </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Bucchi </PERSON> spoke with reporters in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where the heads of central banks from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> began meeting to discuss international strategies to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> alone owes an estimated $ 104 trillion, and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has the biggest foreign debt in the Third World followed by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> with $ 107.4 billion. The meeting began in a climate of tension caused by rumors that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> may declare a moratorium on $ 1.6 billion in interest payments that came due last Friday. However, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON>, adviser on international relations in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said those reports were wrong. `` It's not true,'' <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` We are going to look for a solution quickly to reach an agreement with banks.'' <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON> would not elaborate on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s plans. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has previously suspended payments and, according to news reports in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, such a moratorium would help the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> giant maintain its reserves of $ 6 billion but would hurt its chances of obtaining fresh money from international lenders. `` It is our own political economic mistakes that have determined that development in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is lagging behind the rest of the world,'' said <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancera </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguayo </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s central bank at the opening of Monday's meetings. <PERSON> Mancera </PERSON> said that business activity increased 50 percent over the past 10 years in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but has not kept pace with industrial nations `` because the powerful nations have closed their markets and paid less for prime materials they import,'' according to the independent Excelsior news agency. He said Latin American nations should find their own solutions and not wait for outside answers `` because there have been failures in the management of the political economy that have aggravated the problems.''

<HEAD>Sale of Sears Tower Still Up in the Air</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has plenty of time to sell its towering headquarters building, analysts say _ if it sells it at all. A no-sale option reportedly is under consideration by the nation's largest retailer since its prospective sale of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> to a Canadian developer got sidetracked last week. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment Monday on the report in this week's <LOCATION> Crain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Business, which did not identify its sources for the story One option being considered, according to <PERSON> Crain </PERSON>'s, was a refinancing plan that would amount to a new mortgage on the property. Among Sears watchers, the item was received as one more rumor swirling in the wind around the world's tallest building. `` I'm convinced the tower is to be sold,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, a retail analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But, he added, `` I think it may be sitting on the shelf a while longer.'' Retailing analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' investment value would not suffer if the tower were not sold by year's end, as the company had planned. But <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> had planned to use proceeds from the sale to pay off the money it borrowed for its stock repurchase program. And reducing its debt, reported by <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> as $ 2 billion in a July 31 filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, remains a powerful incentive for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> to sell its tower, <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> said. Some observers believe <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> could still end up selling the 110-story, 1,707-foot landmark to <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Toronto-based company that, until last week, appeared ready to buy <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> for a widely reported $ 1.04 billion. The prospective sale got stalled in a dispute over which party should shoulder a steep increase in property taxes likely to result from a post-sale reassessment. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> York </PERSON> declined to comment on the tower sale, or on whether the firm was backing out in order to devote more resources to bankrolling the cash-starved Canadian retailer <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> York </PERSON> conditionally agreed Friday to loan <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> $ 250 million in a deal that was expected to give the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> developer greater influence over <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s management and a greater ownership stake <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> announced last October it would sell the tower as part of a restructuring plan that included an everyday low-price retailing policy, the transfer of its retailing division headquarters from the tower to suburban <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1990s, and a buyback of 40 million shares, or about 10 percent, of its outstanding stock. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York emerged as the leading bidder in July but the negotiations were rocky. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> apparently insisted its name remain on the building after the sale and the Canadians reportedly had trouble finding a large tenant to anchor the 2 million square feet of office space <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is vacating in the 15-year-old building. British-based publisher <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was said to have been interested in consolidating its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> operations in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> but is now considering other quarters, including a 125-story skyscraper proposed by local developers <ORGANIZATION> Miglin-Beitler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that would be taller than the Sears Tower. `` We submitted a bid -LRB- to <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> -RRB- on Friday,'' said <PERSON> Miglin-Beitler </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarasek </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer inflation turned in its best performance in more than three years in August as prices remained frozen at the previous month's level, the government reported today. It was the first time that the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Consumer Price Index has not registered an increase since April 1986, when it fell by 0.3 percent. The August performance was credited to a 4.2 percent plunge in gasoline prices, the steepest one-month drop in three years. Falling energy prices have given consumers three consecutive months of good news on inflation. Prices were up a modest 0.2 percent in both June and July. This was in sharp contrast to the situation earlier in 1989 when steep hikes in gasoline and food led to a surge in prices pushed the inflation rate up to an annual level of 6.7 percent for the first five months of the year. But with the price moderation in the three months since then, consumer prices are now rising at a more modest annual rate of 4.8 percent, up only slightly from the 4.4 percent increase for all of 1988. In another economic report, meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said housing construction fell 5 percent in August for the largest decline in six months. New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July. While some economists say the country is in for moderation in inflation, other analysts are worried that underlying inflationary pressures are being masked by the plunge in energy costs. These economists say energy prices, which surged early in the year only to fall back somewhat in the past three months, are likely to begin rising again this fall, reflecting higher crude oil costs. Gasoline prices shot up 21.2 percent in the first five months of the year, then fell 1 percent in June, 2.2 percent in July and 4.2 percent in August. The August decline was the biggest drop since a 5.2 percent decrease in August 1986. Natural gas and electricity prices registered a 0.2 percent decline while heating oil costs fell by 0.9 percent last month. Food prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in August following a 0.3 percent July gain. Those figures were in sharp contrast to the first nine months of the year, when the lingering effects of the 1988 drought sent food costs racing ahead at a 9.3 percent annual rate. For August, declines in the cost of pork and poultry were partially offset by increases for beef, fish and eggs. Fruit and vegetable prices fell 0.2 percent in August following a 0.5 percent increase in July. Clothing costs fell a sharp 1.5 percent in August, helping to push apparel prices down by 3.4 percent over the past three months. The price drop was credited to larger than normal end-of-season price cuts for women's and girls' clothing. The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at 124.6 in August, meaning that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods costing $ 100 in the base period of 1982-84 would have cost $ 124.60 last month. The price of goods and services, other than food and energy, rose 0.2 percent in August after climbing by 0.4 percent in July. It is this underlying inflation rate that has some analysts concerned that the battle against rising prices has not been won. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation rate is not as good as it looks,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist at <LOCATION> DRI-McGraw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, an economic consulting firm in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` We are seeing a slow acceleration of inflation but for the next few months that will be hidden by soft energy and food prices,'' he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, agreed with this assessment, saying the big plunge in gasoline prices is coming to an end, reflecting the rise in crude oil prices in recent weeks. `` Gasoline prices will not fall any further while prices other than food and energy will continue to rise on a broad front,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Still, analysts believe the inflation rate for all of 1989 will not be too much worse than in 1988, when consumer prices rose 4.4 percent. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is projecting that consumer prices will rise 5 percent for all of 1989 _ a forecast that is generally in line with most private economists. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is a bit less optimistic, saying it was looking for an inflation rate of between 5 percent and 5.5 percent this year. Many economists believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to ease up on credit anytime soon, in spite of the recent good news on inflation, because of its more pessimistic assumptions about underlying inflationary pressures.

Construction starts fell earlier this year for four straight months before rebounding in June, the longest string of declines since activity slowed for five months in a row from February through June 1987. The May level of 1.31 million starts was the slowest pace since the 1.30 million rate in December 1982. But despite the rebound, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> _ better known as <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> _ said single-family starts at the end of July were running about 3.9 percent below their average for 1988. Total housing starts during the first eight months of the year are down 4.7 percent from the same period of 1988. In addition to its effect on construction jobs and the building materials industries, the housing industry also has an impact on other housing-related businesses such as home furnishings and appliances. Construction of single-family homes last month fell 2.5 percent to an annual rate of 1 million units. Single-family starts had risen 5.9 percent in July after falling 0.5 percent in June. Apartment construction fell 11.4 percent in August to an annual rate of 350,000 units. It had fallen 9 percent in July after rising 31.1 percent in June. The Northeast suffered the largest percentage decline, down 28.2 percent to 140,000 units at an annual rate. It was the largest drop in the region since a 29 percent decline in March and the lowest number of starts since 128,000 units in December 1982. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> suffered a 9.7 percent decline to 241,000 units and the West declined 7.4 percent to 398,000 units. Only the South registered a gain, up 7.9 percent to 574,000 units. Applications for multifamily building permits, a barometer of future multifamily housing activity, were up 8.8 percent in August, following drops of 13.5 percent in July and 1.8 percent in June. Overall applications for building permits rose 3.5 percent after falling 2.1 percent in July.

 The stock market inched higher in early dealings today after two government reports that suggested a further easing of inflationary pressures. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.90 points at 2,689.40 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EDT. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 523 issues up, 400 down and 507 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 21.50 million shares. The government reported today that consumer prices remained unchanged in August, the best inflation performance in more than three years. The August performance was due mainly to falling gasoline prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also reported today that housing construction fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six months. Wall Street analysts said the reports were good news for the stock market because it suggested a slowdown in economic growth and that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may ease credit further. `` The numbers were favorable; both were below expectations,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Nevertheless, volume was light as players remained cautious, <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. `` You do n't get the sense that we're out of the woods yet after gains in the last two days,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. `` There's a sense of caution prevailing.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.25 to 192.68. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was down 0.19 at 397.31. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.92 to 2,687.50. Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 751 up, 693 down and 512 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 136.94 million shares, down from 234.87 million Friday.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today announced a system for writing computer programs with the help of computer programs. The world's biggest computer company held a news conference to announce its commitment to `` computer-aided software engineering,'' which is intended to make software more reliable and faster to develop. More than 30 companies expressed their support for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s blueprint, another demonstration of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s influence in the large-computer business Disorganized writing of software has led to sprawling, patched-together, unmanageable programs that take up valuable programmers' time and stall innovation. The problem has become so acute that corporate chief executives are pressing their computer chiefs for a solution. `` The real driving force behind our industry is that we have got to figure out how to build better software, faster,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Addington </PERSON>, vice president for marketing at <ORGANIZATION> KnowledgeWare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said Monday in advance of the announcement. Sales of tools for computer-aided software engineering already total about $ 300 million a year, even though fewer than 10 percent of customers are even dabbling in it, according to <ORGANIZATION> CASE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. CASE Research expects sales to start jumping about a year from now when software toolmakers have brought their products into line with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s de facto industry standard At least five years will be required to achieve largely automatic programming, but <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment at least legitimizes the concept of it, consultants say. `` This is the Holy Grail. The software industry is committing itself to the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> platform. They do n't have to be cajoled into that; they're doing it readily because they see the value of the rules being established,'' <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>, a consultant in <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and former <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> software executive, said in an interview Monday. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it will come out next June with a `` repository,'' a library containing the information that all the different software engineering tools need to do their jobs. Strict rules will ensure that all toolmakers structure their information in a consistent way. The tools will help programmers at every stage, from the analysis of a business problem, to the overall design of a software solution, to the automatic generation and testing of code that actually carries out the job. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said programs developed with its so-called AD-Cycle system would all have the same look and feel, making them easier for users to learn how to use. `` We believe our announcement today is an important event for this world that runs on software,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrades </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president, said in a prepared statement. He said programmers' speed has lagged far behind the speed of the computers themselves. `` It does n't make sense for computers to process hundreds of millions of instructions per second, while programmers process just 10 instructions per day,'' <PERSON> Conrades </PERSON> said. By automating, software toolmakers hope to keep programmers' hands off of the actual code so they deal only with the higher-level problems of analysis and design `` A lot of research has shown that 60 to 70 percent of the problems in systems are in the analysis and design, so let's put our money where our problems are,'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, president of CASE Research, said Monday. The unusual amount of cooperation with other software developers _ some of which sell rival products _ reflects <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of forming partnerships instead of trying to do everything itself. By making it easier to write programs for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computers, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> hopes to sell more machines to existing customers and possibly attract new customers, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has promoted computer-aided software engineering for several years, but has a much smaller share of the big computer market than <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. igital <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has an uncertain strategy in the field, CASE's <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>, in contrast, is `` sort of the quiet giant'' in computer-aided software engineering, <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said. The difference is that <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> is focusing on aerospace and defense electronics, while <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s major thrust is in the larger commercial market. <ORGANIZATION> KnowledgeWare </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bachman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will be three of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s principal partners in computer-aided software engineering.

 <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it expects a huge loss after a restructuring that includes the addition of $ 950 million to its loan-loss reserves, a new-stock issue and the sale of 60 percent of its <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> financial services unit to <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But the bank holding company, which made the announcement late Monday, said its plan should significantly improve its capital and reserve position. `` We view this as a very positive endeavor for Manufacturers Hanover,'' Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference. Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's seventh largest bank, estimated it would suffer a loss of about $ 775 million for the third quarter and $ 475 million for all of 1989. For the first six months of this year <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>'s profit was down 62 pecent to $ 209 million, or $ 3.70 a share, from the year-earlier period The 1988 period included about $ 388 million in one-time gains from divestitures and tax benefits. Manufacturers Hanover said <PERSON> Dai-Ichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kangyo </PERSON>, the world's largest bank with assets of $ 410 billion, agreed to pay $ 1.28 billion for the 60 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION>. The transaction is the largest purchase of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company by a Japanese bank. <PERSON> Yuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Oana </PERSON>, a senior managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION>, said today that the investment in <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> allows his bank to offer more services globally and to expand its customer base to include more medium-size companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` CIT, with its comprehensive range of asset-backed financing products, will enable us to offer a considerably broader product line to our customers around the world,'' <ORGANIZATION> Oana </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference. `` At the same time, we believe that <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> will benefit from the international exposure and perspective that <ORGANIZATION> DKB </ORGANIZATION> can provide.'' Monday's announcements came after the stock market closed. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> closed up 87 -LCB- cents at $ 41.75 a share Monday. In late-morning trading today, its shares rose $ 1 to $ 42.75. Analysts said they were n't surprised by the moves. Manufacturers Hanover had been coming under increasing pressure to raise capital and increase reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries. The addition of $ 950 million in loan-loss provisions in the third quarter boosts Manufacturers Hanover's loan-loss reserve to $ 2.4 billion, or 36 percent of its portfolio of medium - to long-term loans, up from reserves of $ 1.5 billion, or 22 percent of its loans On average, other big money center banks have reserves equal to about 30 percent of their loans to less-developed countries. `` This should take some of the sting of <ORGANIZATION> LDC </ORGANIZATION> exposure away from <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> and give it some room to maneuver, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Keefe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruyette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think it was a necessary step.'' <PERSON> McGillicuddy </PERSON> said recent debt negotiations with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's plan for reducing the $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt, known as the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> plan, could make it harder for banks to collect on outstanding loans. <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> said it would issue up to $ 500 million in new common stock before year's end. Analysts said the stock sale coupled with the sale of a controlling stake in <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> should provide the bank with much-needed capital to handle its Third World debt problem. <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> is the biggest bank-affiliated finance company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, withassets of $ 9.7 billion and $ 120 million in earnings last year. It provides loans and leases to medium-sized companies through 50 offices nationwide. Manufacturers Hanover acquired the business from <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 for $ 1.5 billion. The deal also includes a private placement with Dai-Ichi of 2.7 million in newly issued common shares of <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> at $ 45 a share for a total of $ 120 million. <PERSON> Dai-Ichi </PERSON> promised not to acquire more than that 4.9 percent stake over a 10-year period. The sale of <ORGANIZATION> CIT </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Dai-Ichi </ORGANIZATION>, which had been rumored for days, is the latest in a series of divestitures in which Manufacturers Hanover has raised cash to bolster its capital. Last year it earned about $ 400 million from the sale of assets.

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dial-a-porn company whose sexually-oriented messages were called repeatedly by a 16-year-old boy will have to pay a $ 600,000 fine under a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> order. The commission, in affirming a 1988 preliminary ruling against <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said Monday the company had not prevented minors from listening to the adult material and had not prevented interstate telephone calls. The commission's investigation `` found the evidence conclusive that <PERSON> Intercambio </PERSON>'s messages were obscene and that it had in fact operated and was continuing to operate in violation of'' the law, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. Interstate dial-a-porn calls to minors are banned under federal law. The commission gave <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> 30 days to pay the fine or face criminal action. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the complaint that prompted the investigation came in 1987 from a woman who said her 16-year-old son was dialing the phone service. According to a commission report, the mother said her son placed more than 280 calls to various dial-a-porn numbers during a 2 -LCB- - month period and was seeing a psychiatrist The commission said the boy listened to <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION>'s messages six times between July and September 1987. In its defense, the company told the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> its service was intended only for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and it had attempted to restrict access to minors. The company also said the law and FCC rules on pornographic phone messages were unconstitutional. But it did not provide evidence to back up its claims, according to Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. There was no phone number listed for <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> and attempts to locate a number for <ORGANIZATION> Intercambio </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glassoff </PERSON>, were unsuccessful Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year attempted to wipe out the dial-a-porn industry by outlawing the sale of indecent phone messages. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June said only obscene material _ patently offensive, sexual and without redeeming value _ may be banned. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted because of complaints from outraged parents who incurred heavy phone bills from children dialing the 976 numbers associated with sexually-oriented material. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said recent technological advances assured children could be kept out the reach of dial-a-porn services and the government had no compelling reason to ban such calls for adults. The $ 600,000 fine was the same as one the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> assessed another <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company last year for transmitting obscene phone messages. But <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement division, said Monday that Audio Enterprises of <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, paid a $ 50,000 fine and agreed to stop selling sexual phone messages while admitting no liability. A third company, 2001 Enterprises of <LOCATION> Reseda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has also agreed to stop its sexually-oriented message business after paying the government $ 25,000, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Cuts Earnings Forecast Due to Soft Sales, Strong Dollar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cosmetics maker <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, pursued earlier this year by several unwanted suitors, Tuesday disclosed it has lowered 1989 income expectations due to weakening sales and a strong dollar. This year's after-tax earnings per share are now forecast at about $ 1.95 to $ 2.15, down from an earlier estimated range of $ 2.30 to $ 2.40. Earnings in 1990 will be an unspecified amount below the previously projected $ 3.35 to $ 3.45 a share, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said. Last year, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> lost $ 404.5 million, or $ 6.79 a share, reflecting a loss from discontinued operations. `` In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, our new products, but especially our new gifts and jewelry products, are falling behind sales expectations,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer. `` In the fourth quarter, non-cosmetic products account for about 50 percent of sales, so that a shortfall in these categories has a disproportionate impact on the company's performance,'' <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said in a news release. The dollar's strength is `` contributing materially to the shortfall,'' <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said. The beauty products manufacturer has been under pressure to enhance profitability in the aftermath of unsolicited takeover proposals that <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s board rejected. Avon over the summer received a $ 41-a-share, or $ 2.85 billion, takeover bid from investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' offer topped an earlier proposal from <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s rival direct seller <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which had proposed acquiring <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> for $ 39 a share, or about $ 2.1 billion. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> also shunned takeover advances from <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the door-to-door cosmetics company. Under <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s management repeatedly has said the company is better off remaining independent, free to carry out plans aimed at improving the balance sheet. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> still is committed to the strategy outlined at a meeting with financial analysts May 19 and that the company is achieving many elements of the strategy. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> recently said it is considering the sale of its retail fragrance subsidiaries, <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parfums </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said the revised earnings projections do n't include the effect of a potential sale of the perfume businesses.

<HEAD>UAL Non-Union Workers Face 10 Percent Pay Cut: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' 24,000 non-union employees face a 10 percent pay cut if the $ 6.75 billion employee buyout of parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> goes through as planned, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>, quoting an unidentifed adviser to the buyout group, said the pay cut would apply to managers and most salaried workers. The lowest-paid clerical workers will not be affected, nor will employees in one or two fields requiring highly specialized skills and training since those workers could easily find comparable jobs with another airline, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> declined comment on the report. The United chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is spearheading the buyout effort, said it could not immediately confirm the story. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors accepted the pilot-led, $ 300-per-share takeover offer on Thursday, rejecting a competing offer from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The plan, which would make <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> the biggest employee-owned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company, calls for employees to own 75 percent with management owning 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> holding 15 percent. The pilots earlier revealed that they would take pay cuts of up 10 percent as part of the buyout plan. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s flight attendants are considering management-proposed contract concessions in exchange for their participation in the buyout.

 The stock market was slightly higher in moderate trading today after the government released new economic reports that pointed to a lowering of inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.80 points at 2,691.30 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 1.90 points an hour earlier. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 649 issues up, 504 down and 533 unchanged.

New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July. Wall Street analysts said the numbers were below expectations and good news for the stock market because they suggested an easing of inflation, adding to hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates. Nevertheless, many big institutional investors stayed were on the sidelines, remaining cautious about the viability of the junk-bond market after last week's sharp declines, analysts said. `` You do n't get the sense that we're out of the woods yet after gains in the last two days,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's a sense of caution prevailing.''

 A former employee of defense contractor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> has been arrested and charged with providing inside information to a welding company bidding on contracts. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, 62, bilked the company of thousands of dollars through a kickback scheme with <PERSON> Wynn </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Welding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, said federal authorities. `` We uncovered it, investigated it internally and turned it over to federal authorities,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> spokesman Chip Manor on Monday. The case is the second alleged kickback scheme <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> has faced in less than two months. On Aug. 9, a former <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> employment administrator was indicted in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> on charges of defrauding the company of more than $ 55,000 in an operation involving employment agencies in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office is continuing the investigation into the <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> case, said prosecutor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Librick </PERSON>, and other charges may be filed. <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, could not be reached for comment. The alleged scheme took place from Jan. 16, 1987, to Sept. 11, 1987, according to court documents.

 The stock market was slightly higher in moderate trading today after the release of new economic reports that pointed to a lowering of inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.99 points at noon EDT. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 659 issues up, 577 down and 559 unchange. Transportation stocks were rebounding after declines in the last two weeks. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 66.72 million shares. The government reported today that consumer prices remained unchanged in August, the best inflation performance in more than three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also reported that housing construction fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six months. New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July. Wall Street analysts said the numbers were below expectations and good news for the stock market because they suggested an easing of inflation and added to hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates. Nevertheless, many big institutional investors stayed away from the market. Traders said many were remaining cautious about the viability of the junk-bond market after last week's sharp declines. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.34 to 192.77.

 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> today denounced efforts to export <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarettes as `` the height of hypocrisy.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who is retiring Oct. 1, testified at a hearing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative against a request by the cigarette industry for government intervention to force <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to allow sales and advertising of American cigarettes. `` When we are persuading foreign governments to stop the flow of cocaine, it is the height of hypocrisy to export tobacco,'' said <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, who has conducted a vigorous anti-smoking campaign throughout his tenure. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cigarette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has requested the intervention and the trade representative is to decide the issue by next May. In 1988, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco exports contributed a record $ 3.5 billion to helping reduce `` this country's onerous trade deficit,'' said export association President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` People throughout <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> will continue to buy and smoke billions of cigarettes each year with or without <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the marketplace,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION> `` The real issue is whether <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies will be allowed to compete, or if the playing field will be abandoned to other foreign manufacturers and local monopolies.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, D-Mass., said the real issue `` is about the American government using leverage and tax dollars to coerce countries into allowing marketing practices that were outlawed long ago'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The petition seeks to force <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> `` to overturn a policy of banning cigarette advertisements'' in print and broadcast media, <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. The export association represents three major cigarette companies, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. Since 1986, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> have opened markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette brands after being accused of unfair trade and threatened with retaliation against their products. `` I believe that most Americans would be appalled to learn that their government, which banned cigarette advertisements on TV, required warning labels on cigarettes ... is aggressively pushing cigarette addiction overseas through the trade representative,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. `` It is simply inexcusable for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to exert its great influence to force <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to reverse its health policy,'' he said. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> is sponsoring legislation to require that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette brands sold abroad carry warnings and advertising restrictions equivalent to those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The industry argues that foreign countries are competent to make their own regulations.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar ended weaker in European trading Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> intervened to keep the currency down. Gold prices also waned. The dollar was quoted late in the day at 1.9505 Deutsche marks, down from 1.9525 marks late Monday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The dollar ended the European trading day at 145.55 yen. That came after a fall of 0.70 yen in trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the dollar closed at 145.73 yen. Dealers said trading was fairly thin and inactive because many market players remain skittish about jumping back in after Friday' sharp slide from over 2.00 marks to 1.9350 marks `` People do n't have much of a medium-term view about the dollar now,'' said a corporate dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Other late dollar rates compared with late Monday: 1.6870 Swiss francs, up from 1.6850; 6.5875 French francs, down from 6.5890; 2.2000 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2180; 1,406.50 Italian lire, down from 1,417.40; 1.1833 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1834. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound sterling firmed to $ 1.5720 compared with $ 1.5695 late Monday.

 Financially crippled <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> today secured an emergency loan that will enable its department stores to pay debts but force the company's founder <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> to relinquish control. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s problems, caused largely by obligations on its `` junk bond'' debts, had raised doubts about the future of his company and injected uncertainty into the $ 200 billion market in junk bonds, which are high-yield, high-risk securities used to finance takeovers and expansion. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which is providing the $ 250 million loan, also obtained the power to steer <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> through a major financial overhaul. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> brothers, will be given three seats on a new 10-member <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> board and the right to buy almost 16 million shares of the Canadian retail and property holding company. The first portion of the loan from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> York </PERSON> became available immediately, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said in an announcement released by its <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> headquarters. The agreement calls for up to $ 150 million to be channeled to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the remainder to its <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> division. The money will allow the department store operators to meet interest payments now due on debts and to pay suppliers shipping merchandise ahead of the crucial Christmas shopping season. Under the definitive agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, a new board of directors was appointed. The configuration of the board reflects the amount of power that Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> relinguished in the company he built. Three members of the new board come from the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> group, three from <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> and four represent minority shareholders. The board formed a restructuring committee headed by one of the three Reichmann-appointed members of the board, <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>. The committee intends to hire the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to help develop a restructuring plan and retail business consultants from <ORGANIZATION> McKinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also will be engaged. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>, who retained the titles of chairman and chief executive officer, said the company's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm will employ a chief executive officer and chief financial officer whose main mission will be to supervise the restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s retail operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two new executives, who have yet to be selected, will report directly to the board and the restructuring committee. Part of the restructuring includes the sale of the 17-store <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s chain, which is part of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York will use its `` best efforts'' to arrange temporary financing of about $ 800 million until <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> can arrange for the sale of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s. <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to put up some of the bridge loan, if necessary. For coming to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s rescue, <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York will receive warrants entitling it to purchase up to 15.625 million ordinary <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> shares at $ 16 a piece until Sept. 18, 1991. Added to its current 24.5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, the purchase of 16 million additional shares would raise <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York's interest in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> to 38.4 percent, on a fully diluted basis <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON>'s stake would be cut to 43.2 percent from about 54 percent, under the agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> common stock last traded at $ 13.50 Canadian dollars before it was halted last Wednesday, after trading as high as $ 22.25 a few days earlier. Commenting on the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Campeau </PERSON> said after reviewing projected cash flow requirements and the financial position of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries, he determined that a major restructuring was needed to reduce leverage. `` At my request, <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to substantially increase its investment in <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> and to be primarily responsible for the refinancing and restructuring,'' <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The significant experience and expertise of the <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York organization will greatly assist in the endeavor.''

<HEAD>Housing Construction Down in August</HEAD>

 Housing construction, depressed by a spike in mortgage rates, fell by 5 percent in August, the government said Tuesday in a report many analysts viewed as only a temporary setback for the housing industry. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units last month, down from 1.42 million units in July. It was the first decline since May and the largest setback since a 12.7 percent fall last February. Housing starts had risen 1.3 percent in July and 7.5 percent in June. Fixed mortgage rates, which peaked at 11.22 percent in March, had fallen to 9.68 percent by Aug. 4, but then rose by about one-half percentage point through August. However, in recent weeks they have begun edging down slightly, now standing at 10.05 percent, according to the weekly survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Economists predicted continued small declines in mortgage rates for the rest of the year and said this should bolster sales and construction figures `` The -LRB- August -RRB- housing starts numbers show builders were waiting out the recent uptick in interest rates,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. `` However, the higher rate of building permits is a good sign that the stalled activity in August is only temporary.'' Overall applications for building permits, considered a good barometer of future activity, rose 3.5 percent after falling 2.1 percent in July. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said the drop in construction and another report Tuesday showing consumer prices did not rise in August should convince the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to stop fighting inflation and resume lowering interest rates to bolster the economy. However, other economists said they doubted that the weak construction number would prompt action on the part of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, given the fact that other statistics show the economy is continuing to grow at a healthy rate. `` I do n't think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will do anything to change policy for the next several months,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed that interest rates will fall despite <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> intervention as financial market fears about inflation ease. Construction starts fell earlier this year for four straight months before rebounding in June, the longest string of declines since activity slowed for five months in a row from February through June 1987. The May level of 1.31 million starts was the slowest pace since the 1.30 million rate in December 1982. Total housing starts during the first eight months of the year are down 4.7 percent from the same period of 1988. Construction of single-family homes last month fell 2.5 percent to an annual rate of 1 million units. Single-family starts had risen 5.9 percent in July after falling 0.5 percent in June. Apartment construction fell 11.4 percent in August to an annual rate of 350,000 units. It had fallen 9 percent in July after rising 31.1 percent in June.

 Stock prices were moderately lower Tuesday. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 12.3 points, or 0.5 percent, lower at 2361.5, nearly 10 points above a session low of 2351.4 and off the intraday high of 2379.4. Volume was 393.5 million shares, up from 310.2 million Monday.

A late announcement by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that it may bid for a friendly stake in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> injected some fresh confidence into what has largely been a takeover-driven market, dealers said.

 What do you give to the man who REALLY has everything? In billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s case, it's his own television program _ `` Trump Card,'' a game show set to debut next year. `` I think it will be tremendously successful. We're trading on the glamour of the Trump Castle, the Trump Princess,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said Tuesday at a news conference _ in the Trump Tower _ announcing the show. `` The Trump name has never been hotter,'' he said, mentioning -LRB- repeatedly -RRB- the successes of his Trump Shuttle, his Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casinos, and his book `` Trump: The Art of the Deal.'' He also produced Miss America 1990 <PERSON> Debbye </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> to say a few nice things about him. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said his share of the profits on the show _ which he estimated could be in the millions of dollars _ will go to charity. The show, which will be syndicated and air Monday through Friday, is based on a top-rated British game show called `` Full House,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> developed the program, which will be distributed through <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he decided to proceed with the idea after getting a one-on-one sales pitch from a <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> executive he accidentally encountered on one of his helicopters `` This idea stopped us in our tracks,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> president for domestic television distribution. `` It's the best single new idea we'd seen in years. The show, to be filmed at the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, will feature three contestants trying to answer questions and thereby filling in their `` Trump Card'' _ a box of 15 squares. Prize money for the winners has not yet been determined, <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON> said. The show's host has not been named yet either, although <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> ruled out casino competitor and game show producer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> is a friend of mine. <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> is a good guy.

<HEAD>IBM Promises 20,000 Experts to Help With Software Engineering</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it would make 20,000 experts available worldwide to help its customers adapt to the coming era of software engineering. The statement came as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announced, as expected, that it was committing itself to computer-aided software engineering, or CASE. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement is expected to give a large boost to the high-tech field, which already garners about $ 300 million in annual revenue. Software engineering is intended to replace disorganized methods of software-writing that have led to chaotic, unmanageable and failure-prone programs for large computers. Consultants said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s promise of experts to help customers was an important part of the announcement, since the transition to software engineering promises to be a real test of programmers' flexibility `` The limiting factor on the introduction of CASE technology is the ability of information systems shops to cope with a radically new culture. It is going to take them quite some years,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It's going to require an investment, not just of the company's time but of a person's ability to recycle themselves, re-engineer themselves,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, the Dallas-based director of information systems consulting markets for <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON> Some of the 20,000 experts will come from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and some from four outside firms designated by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>: CAP <ORGANIZATION> Gemini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> Consulting. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is calling its offering AD-Cycle. Its strategy relies heavily on existing software-development tools marketed by other companies that beat <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> to the market, particularly <ORGANIZATION> KnowledgeWare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bachman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. More than 30 companies on Tuesday announced their support for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s plan, which will roll out over the next several years This may be the farthest <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has ever gone in using other companies' products as a central part of its own strategy, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrades </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president. `` It's a high-water mark, but it's an ever-rising tide,'' he said in an interview.

 The stock market was narrowly higher in afternoon trading after getting a lift early in the day from new economic reports that pointed to an easing of inflationary pressures. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.80 points to 2,691.30 at 2 p.m. EDT after rising more than 10 points in late-morning trading. Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 691 issues up, 661 down and 554 unchanged. Transportation and pharmaceutical stocks were some of the few standouts in an otherwise featureless session, traders said. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 97.22 million shares. The government reported today that consumer prices remained unchanged in August, the best inflation performance in more than three years. Prices were up a modest 0.2 percent in both June and July. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also reported that housing construction fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six months. New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July. Wall Street analysts said the numbers were below expectations and good news for the stock market because they suggested an easing of inflation and added to hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates. Although institutional trading was light, some selling by big investors early in the afternoon wiped out some of the market's earlier gains The junk bond market rallied after <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced that it had secured a $ 250 million loan to pay its creditors. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.17 to 192.60.

<HEAD>Disney Suing Over Tax Bill: $12,000 or $1.4 Million?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is challenging a 254 percent property tax increase county officials say was levied to help pay for huge commercial growth and traffic problems near the tourist attraction. Disney on Monday paid <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> $ 12,000, the company's own estimate of 1989 property taxes owed. The county plans to bill Disney for $ 1.4 million. Disney spokesman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said Tuesday the company filed a lawsuit in state circuit court `` to protect our rights to challenge, although we hope to come to an agreement with county authorities on the whole subject.'' Osceola removed the agricultural classification on most of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s undeveloped property in the county and jacked up the tax bill to $ 1.4 million. Disney's theme park is located north of the area, in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Disney filed the lawsuit Friday to beat a Monday deadline on challenges to tax assessments. A Disney representative on Monday dropped off checks totaling $ 12,012 _ the company's `` good-faith estimate'' of its 1989 taxes. `` It's kind of like they're thumbing their nose at us, is n't it? Osceola Property Appraiser <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> said. `` I mean $ 12,000 vs. $ 1.4 million. There's a big difference there, would n't you say?'' Until this year, much of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s 7,013 acres of undeveloped property was classified as agricultural because <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> leased a portion to a cattle rancher and contracted with a timber company to harvest pine trees. The property was assessed at $ 26.9 million last year, and the company paid <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION> $ 395,000 in taxes. After removing the agricultural exemption, Day in July reassessed the land at $ 84 million. Disney contends even last year's taxes were excessive because the 1988 payment was based on a commercial classification for part of the property, as well as on the portion classified agricultural. Disney's estimated payment Monday represents the total amount of 1989 taxes the company believes it owes because `` all of that land rightfully should be classified as agricultural,'' <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said. `` Under the law, you pay what you feel you should properly pay,'' he said. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> paid its other host county, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, $ 24 million in taxes last year and is expected to pay $ 33.65 million this year. Much of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> property contain's its prosperous tourist attractions. In recent years, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> has built the Disney-MGM Studios park, <LOCATION> Pleasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and Typhoon Lagoon next in Orange near the Osceola land. But Osceola Commissioner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaley </PERSON> said: `` We have just as many problems from <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> does. And they're getting $ 33 million in taxes.'' Osceola in 1973 tried to strip Disney of its agricultural classification but <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> won a legal battle. But the tourist attraction has grown since then, county officials argue, and have had a greater impact on the county.

 <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s first portable Macintosh computer is more expensive, bigger and heavier than the latest generation of laptops but the company said Tuesday it makes no compromises on features. Apple hopes to offset the drawbacks of its Macintosh Portable by giving users all the power and features they would get on a full-size Macintosh. `` It's a Macintosh through and through. Now our customers can have Macintosh personal computing anywhere,'' <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gassee </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement. Analysts have been lukewarm toward <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s first portable. `` I think it'll do well with <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s existing customer base. I'm not sure it'll gain share in the overall laptop market, though,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Quist in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` It's a little little big and it's also a little pricey.'' The portable lists at $ 5,799, or $ 6,499 with an optional 40-megabyte hard disk for data storage. A modem for communication over phone lines is extra at $ 449. The weight is 13.7 pounds, or 15.7 pounds with the optional 40-megabyte hard disk. The screen is one-tone rather than color, but is unusually sharp because there is a separate transistor for each screen dot, or picture element. The screen contains more than 250,000 picture elements in a 640 by 400 array, making it 50 percent larger than the screen on a Macintosh SE. To conserve batteries, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> used a version of the Motorola 68000 processor chip that requires 80 percent less power. It also used a low-power kind of memory chip. The lead acid batteries last from six to 12 hours and can be recharged to capacity at any time, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> said. Apple, based in <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, also announced the Macintosh IIci, an advanced version of the Macintosh IIcx, which it billed as `` the most powerful Macintosh that <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> has ever developed.'' The Macintosh IIci starts at $ 6,269 and ranges up to $ 9,152, putting it in the price range of some computer workstations, machines designed for scientists and engineers. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> said it delivers 55 percent higher performance than the Macintosh IIcx or IIx. It has built-in video capabilities.

<HEAD>Ford Purchasing Up to 15 Percent of Jaguar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced plans Tuesday to buy up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, saying it wanted a long-term relationship with the unprofitable British luxury auto maker. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, which has been battered by flagging sales in its principal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market during the past year, maintained that it wanted to remain independent but did n't rule out collaborating with another car company. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which already has a huge European presence and is negotiating a possible transaction with Swedish automaker <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>, could benefit from an association with the well-known <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> luxury car line, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> stock soared 97 cents to close at $ 7.33 a share on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, as some speculated that other companies also might be assembling stakes in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s articles of association limit individual shareholdings to 15 percent until the end of 1990, and the government has veto power over any takeover through the same period. `` It has always been our desire to maintain our independence,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who was n't identified in keeping with company policy. However, the spokesman also said <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> has held out the possibility of collaborating with another car maker. The spokesman said the Coventry-based company was notified of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s plans on Tuesday and that <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> would n't make any final comment until its board of directors had a chance to discuss them at an unspecified date. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Halstead </PERSON>, speaking at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> news conference, said his company's intentions are not hostile. He characterized contact with <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> on Tuesday as `` friendly and open and we agreed to leave the lines of communication open.'' The two companies held private, informal talks last year which failed to produce any sort of working agreement, <PERSON> Halstead </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has informed the British government of its plans but has not gotten a reaction from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>. The spokesman said: `` It is too early to say what might happen then -LRB- 1990 -RRB-, but we regard the acquisition of a minority shareholding in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> as a basis for a longer-term strategic association between our two companies as we explained to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> in private discussion.'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> respected <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s distinctive British character and would want to maintain its separate identity and help strengthen its image. Last Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> posted an after-tax loss of $ 1.7 million on sales of $ 870 million for the first six months of the year. The company expects to sell 20,000 cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year, down from 20,700 in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which is headquartered in <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, makes 1.8 million vehicles a year. It has 21 European plants, 11 of them in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and employs more than110 ,000 people Parent <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is the second largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker behind <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> posted an industry record profit of $ 5.3 billion, or $ 10.96 a share, on revenue of $ 92.45 billion in 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> confirmed earlier this month that it was negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>, the Swedish airplane, truck and automaker, over a possible transaction. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, automotive analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> may have made its move now because it believed <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s share price was headed higher, or because it wanted to preempt a move by another auto maker. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwood </PERSON>, an automotive analyst at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Hoare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Govett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said he would not be surprised if other automakers also were buying <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> stakes. Although <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> is losing money, its brand name is highly valuable, the analysts said. <PERSON> Halstead </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> could benefit from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s European production and marketing. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> could benefit from economies of scale in parts and materials purchasing, as well as from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s engineering research <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said the company has begun buying <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> shares on the open market, but he declined to elaborate on <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s purchases Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> antitrust law <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> must notify the government once it acquiresa $ 15 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> stock, about a 1.2 percent stake, and then would have to wait 30 days before buying more.

 Soybeans for spot delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> dropped to a 22-month low Tuesday as traders liquidated their holdings for September delivery ahead of the contract's expiration on Wednesday.

Aside from the drop in the September soybean contract to $ 5.63 per bushel, the lowest near-month delivery price since Nov. 16, 1987, the markets held up well in the face of the advancing harvest and forecasts for weather beneficial to the corn and soybean crops. `` The market is still pretty resilient,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>UAL Non-Union Workers Said To Face 10 Percent Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' 24,000 nonunion workers face a 10 percent pay cut if the $ 6.75 billion employee buyout of parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> goes through as planned, according to a published report Tuesday. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots, who are spearheading the takeover effort, demonstrated their good faith by flying the airline's new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 jets, something they had refused to do since June due to a labor dispute. Quoting an unidentifed adviser to the buyout group, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> said the 10 percent pay cut would apply to managers and most other salaried workers. The lowest-paid clerical workers would not be affected, nor would employees in one or two fields requiring highly specialized skills and training, since those workers could easily find comparable jobs with other airlines, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> declined to comment on the report. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he could not confirm the story. `` That's between <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> management and those workers,'' <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have any say about how that's going to come down.'' The pilots' union revealed last week that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 7,000 pilots would take pay cuts of up to 10 percent as part of the $ 300-a-share buyout plan accepted last Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. The plan calls for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> workers to own 75 percent of the company with management owning 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> 15 percent. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, would continue to run the company for the new employee-owners. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> were meeting in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to discuss management-proposed contract concessions that would enable them to participate in ownership of the nation's second-largest airline. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s largest union, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, opposed the buyout. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, the only worker group committed so far to the buyout plan, began flying the airline's new fuel-efficient 747-400s on Monday with nonstop service from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The pilots had refused to fly the long-range aircraft, which began arriving in June, because of a dispute over staffing requirements. The pilots, who have been without a contract for 17 months, had agreed to begin flying the jets if <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board accepted their buyout bid. The agreement calls for two pilots on flights of up to eight hours, three on flights of more than eight hours and four on flights of more than 12 hours, <PERSON> Krakowski </PERSON> said. The pilots will implement another term of the agreement in November when their maximum workload goes to 85 flight hours a month from 81 with no increase in pay, he said.

 A late bout of selling sent stock prices tumbling just before the closing bell despite good news on the inflation front that had kept prices firmer during much of the session. The market opened higher after two new economic reports suggested that inflationary pressures had eased further during August. But while blue-chip stocks gained, the broader market lagged behind, traders said. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer prices remained unchanged in August as measured by its Consumer Price Index. It was the best inflation performance in more than three years. Prices were up a modest 0.2 percent in both June and July.

Wall Street analysts said the data suggested an easing of inflationary pressures and added to hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates. Although institutional trading was light, selling by institutions early in the afternoon wiped out some of the market's earlier gains. The market showed some confidence after a rally in the junk bond market following Canadian retail giant <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it had secured a $ 250 million loan to pay its creditors. Junk bond prices had fallen sharply in recent sessions after word of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial troubles raised concern about the viability of the high-yield, high-risk securities. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had used junk bonds to finance recent acquisitions. But late in the day, stocks retreated under pressure of a late bout of computer-driven program selling. Transportation and pharmaceutical stocks were among the few standouts in an otherwise featureless session, traders said.

<HEAD>ZZZZ Best Official Ordered to Repay Profits, Gets Triple Penalties</HEAD>

 A former <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> official was ordered to return profits he made by trading stock in the rug-shampooing firm founded by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who was convicted of defrauding investors in a company-wide scam. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Polevoi </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> also was ordered Monday to pay $ 675,000 in civil penalties by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> told <PERSON> Polevoi </PERSON> to refrain from violating securities laws, the same order he issued last month to <PERSON> Polevoi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, who also was involved in the ZZZZ Best scam. The brothers had ordered 54,200 shares of <ORGANIZATION> ZZZZ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> stock `` sold short'' _ a way of betting a stock price will decline _ in mid-1987, when they knew <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>'s scams were falling apart but before the public had a chance to know, prosecutors said. The brothers jointly were ordered to repay $ 224,860.75 in profits. Each also must pay triple that amount in civil penalties, or $ 674.582.25, according to <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON>'s order. They already are serving 18-month prison terms for stock fraud and tax fraud for their role in the ZZZZ Best scandal, which used a `` Ponzi scheme'' style scam in which money from later investors was used to pay early debts while nearly no work was actually performed by the company. <PERSON> Minkow </PERSON>, who started ZZZZ Best as a teen-ager in his parents' garage, was convicted of 57 counts of fraud, conspiracy and other charges, and sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $ 26 million in restitution and penalties

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said Tuesday that agreements to generate Polish-American business and improve tourism will be signed during his visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Also under way are plans to put retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> executives in Polish companies to help teach market-oriented management. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> told an audience of Polish and American business leaders the economic changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are as impressive as the political transformations that resulted in the first non-communist-led government in four decades. `` Who would have imagined a short time ago that foreign firms not only would be able to invest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but also form 100 percent foreign-owned enterprises?'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said. The commerce secretary met Tuesday with Solidarity Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and Foreign Trade Minister <PERSON> Marcin </PERSON> <PERSON> Swiecicki </PERSON>. On Wednesday, he said he is to sign an agreement `` to build close and growing contacts between Polish and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms and to generate bilateral business.'' Also to be formalized is an accord designed to impove tourism and expand <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tourism-related business in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the secretary said. No details were provided on either program Tuesday. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> is to see Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> on Wednesday, and witness the formal creation of a joint fishing venture involving American, Danish and Polish interests. Support from the West, including new trade and investment, is considered key to the success of the <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> government and its efforts to reverse <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic crisis. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> is one of the first guests at the new Marriot Hotel being completed in a long unfinished <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> skyscraper. The hotel is a joint venture with the Polish airlines LOT and is considered a major test of the potential for American investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Numerous obstacles face would-be investors, including an antiquated telephone system and the scarcity of even basic business supplies such as paper. But <PERSON> Beurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Servaas </PERSON>, an Indianoplis publishing executive who heads the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said his seven years of investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> leads him to believe there are opportunities `` It cost us some money to get started, and I call that education,'' he said. There are currently only about two dozen joint ventures between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> And Polish companies.

<HEAD>Large Chrysler Cars To Be Rounder in Three Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s new line of boxy luxury cars will be replaced beginning in 1993 by rounder models, company executives said Tuesday. The comments came as <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> introduced its 1990 cars, including a new Imperial, a nameplate asbent for seven years. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will begin its LH large-and luxury-car program for the 1993 model year, with four-door, front-wheel-drive models. Manufacturing capability will permit two-door and rear-wheel-drive models, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowaleski </PERSON> said. Replacements of the company's line of luxury cars are part of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s plans, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappert </PERSON>, vice president for sales for the nation's No. 3 automaker. Officials said the company planned to offer more rounded luxury cars in the future. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> introduced a rounder <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> Car. When asked if <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> planned to sell two styles of large cars, <PERSON> Pappert </PERSON>, standing about 20 feet from a new Imperial, said, `` I think we are n't going to keep two.'' The four-door 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> revives a nameplate last seen in the 1983 model year on a two-door model. The last Imperial four-door was for the 1975 model year. Also Tuesday, Dodge Division General Manager <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Damoose </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> likely will build the Viper two-seat sports car for the 1993 model year, although some engineering problems and financial concerns are lingering. The car, to be powered by a V-10 or a V-8 engine with up to 400 horsepower, will sell at less than 5,000 a year, an extremely small volume. By comparison, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is speculating that about 40,000 of its two-seat sports car Miata will be sold annually. <PERSON> Damoose </PERSON> said the Viper, first unveiled on the auto show circuit in January, will cost between $ 25,000 and $ 30,000. The Miata has a base price of $ 13,800.

<HEAD>Spot Soybeans Slump To 22-Month Low</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybeans for spot delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> fell to a 22-month low Tuesday on a combination of harvest pressure and position-evening in the September contract ahead of its expiration on Wednesday. Other soybean contracts closed mostly higher while most corn and wheat futures retreated amid increased corn harvesting and slack export demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains. On other commodity markets, energy futures were sharply lower; cocoa futures advanced; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and precious metals inched lower. Soybean futures settled 9 \ cents lower to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 5.63 a bushel, the lowest near-month delivery price since Nov. 16, 1987 Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2 \ cents lower with September at $ 3.80 a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to 2 cents higher with September at $ 2.33 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at $ 1.34 a Aside from the drop in the September soybean contract, the markets held up well in the face of the advancing harvest and forecasts for continued beneficial crop weather. `` The market is still pretty resilient,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported late Monday that 6 percent of the corn crop had been harvested in the 17 largest corn-growing states as of Sunday while 1 percent of the soybean crop had been cut in the top 19 soybean states. Support stemmed from scattered forecasts for freezing temperatures Sunday night in the Corn Belt. But with the crops at or rapidly approaching maturity, the danger of significant frost damage is almost past, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> said. Crude-oil futures fell steeply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, paced by liquidation in the expiring October crude-oil contract, which goes off the board Wednesday. Heating-oil futures also weakened significantly, partly as a result of mild temperatures in the heavily populated Northeast. `` Heating oil is not getting any help from seasonal factors and supplies seem to be building,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, vice president of trading and research with <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-area petroleum distributor. After the close, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of petroleum distillates, including heating oil, increased by 1.61 million barrels last week. Gasoline stocks rose by 244,000 barrels while crude oil stocks fell 9.61 million barrels. <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON> said gasoline futures prices were lightly supported by fears that Hurricane Hugo could swing into the Gulf Coast, damaging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil refineries. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 32 cents lower with October at $ 19.56 a barrel; heating oil was .43 cent to .77 cent lower with October at 54.95 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .34 cent to .50 cent lower with October at 57.67 cents a gallon. Cocoa futures rebounded modestly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after tumbling to 14-year lows Monday following the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to repair its battered price-support mechanism. Cocoa settled $ 9 to $ 13 higher with December at $ 1,047 per metric ton. Cattle futures finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of Monday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report showing lighter-than-expected marketings of cattle off of feed lots last month. Live cattle settled .52 cent lower to .02 cent higher with October at 71.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .50 cent lower with September at 83.17 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .38 cent higher with October at 41.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .70 cent to .77 cent lower with February at 47.50 cents a pound. Precious-metal futures drifted lower in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report of no change in consumer prices last month. Gold and silver perform best during times of rising inflation. Gold futures settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with September at $ 361.20 a troy ounce; silver was 0.1 cent to .03 cent lower with September at $ 5.061 a troy ounce.

 The stock market closed narrowly mixed in featureless trading Tuesday after getting a boost early in the day from new economic data that showed good news on inflation. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 0.19 point to finish at 2,687.31 after gaining more than 10 points during the session. Advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 739 issues up, 696 down and 536 unchanged. The market opened higher and remained above Monday's levels until the final hour of trading when a mixture of factors pushed the market lower. `` There's no particular reason that the market backed off,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was some program trading but that's not the reason. If there's anything that explains the late decline I would say it's the slight retreat in bond prices after their early gains. Blue-chip issues led the stock market after the government reported on consumer prices and housing construction. But the gains were limited as the broader market lagged, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that consumer prices as measured by its Consumer Price Index remained unchanged in August. It was the best inflation performance in more than three years. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also reported that housing construction fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six months. New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July. Wall Street analysts said the numbers suggested an easing of inflation, and added to hopes that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates. Transportation stocks rebounded slightly after being depressed in recent sessions and pharmaceutical issues showed some strength in an otherwise dull session lacking in leadership. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 141.61 million shares, up from 136.94 million in the previous session, with many institutional investors remaining cautious in light of recent sharp declines in the junk-bond market. `` The junk-bond scare is still a cloud hanging over the market,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Luedtke </PERSON>, stock market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 168.168 million shares As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market advanced $ 0.031 billion in value, or less than 1 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks edged up 0.03 to 192.46.

 Energy futures prices declined Tuesday in trading dominated by technical factors. The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 32 cents to settle at $ 19.56 a 42-gallon barrel after having dropped 8 cents on Monday. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the October contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline dropped 0.46 cent to close at 57.67 cents a gallon after picking up 0.52 cent the previous session. Home heating oil for October delivery, which declined 0.23 cent on Monday, lost another 0.77 cent to 54.95 cents a gallon. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said some of the declines were due to profit-taking as traders took advantage of the market's recent rally. `` We've been in an advancing market and needed to sell off to relieve the overbought condition,'' <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. There were spates of buying during the day, but prices were unable to hold at higher levels, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. The October West Texas Intermediate contract traded as high as $ 19.80 during the session before dropping back. Oil traders have become cautious in advance of Saturday's meeting of the strategy and price-monitoring committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The eight-member committee, which is expected to discuss <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s overproduction problems, can not make any changes in the cartel's policies but can make recommendations to the full 13-nation Many analysts say market prices could weaken significantly if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> fails to show at this weekend's meeting that it plans to act decisively to contain overproduction.

 The Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comittee </ORGANIZATION> bowed Tuesday to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rejection of anything more than a $ 4.25 minimum wage. But it coupled the 90-cent increase in the present $ 3.35-an-hour wage floor with restrictions on the 80 percent subminimum `` training wage'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is demanding _ a move that administration officials say will prompt another veto. On a party-line voice vote, the committee approved a bill identical to a measure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed in June except that it provides two hourly increases _ one this January and the other in January 1991 _ of 45 cents each. The vetoed bill had provided for three annual increases to $ 4.55 an hour by Oct. 1, 1991. Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> reiterated in a memo <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to veto any bill which raises the current $ 3.35 floor to $ 4.25 in less than three years or that establishes a subminimum `` training wage'' only for first-time job market entrants <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would allow employers to pay an 80 percent subminimum to any newly hired workers. The committee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the reduction from the previous $ 4.55 wage floor that had been sought was aimed at garnering support from Southern Democrats and some Republicans for an override of another <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto While both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year approved the $ 4.55 minimum wage with a 60-day subminimum training wage applicable only to first-time workers, neither could muster the two-thirds majority needed to override <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto. `` There are some Republican members ready to change their votes if the president does n't'' show a willingness to compromise, <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sources said the bill could be brought up there within the next three weeks. Just before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recessed in August, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reapproved the same $ 4.55 minimum wage bill that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed, but with the understanding that it would likely be modified on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has demanded a six-month training wage compared to the 60-day subfloor Democrats are willing to allow. Both sides have indicated a willingness to negotiate away differences in the time span, but neither is budging on the applicability. Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel's labor standards subcommittee, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal would allow employers to pay a $ 3.40 subminimum wage perpetually by rotating new hires in and out every 60 days to six months `` I must say to the president, ` Read my lips,''' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said, adopting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign motto on higher taxes. `` No way will I permit that man to sign a fake increase in the minimum wage for some political purpose two years down the road.''

<HEAD>ConAgra Posts Record Quarterly Sales and Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which lost to <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the battle to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, reported record sales and earnings Tuesday for the first quarter of its fiscal year. Earnings for the quarter ended Aug. 27 increased 31 percent to $ 50 million, or 60 cents a share, from $ 38.2 million, or 48 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Sales rose 43 percent to $ 4.01 billion from $ 2.81 billion in the year-ago quarter. Although <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> lost to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> in the fight for <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, the Omaha-based food company received a $ 50 million payment from <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> in June as part of an agreement in case the merger with the chicken processor failed. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> reported a $ 26.9 million one-time, after-tax gain in the quarter from the settlement, after expenses. It also took a $ 24.8 million after-tax charge from a realignment of its processed meat operations. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company is headed for its 10th straight year of record earnings. He said sales could reach $ 16 billion in fiscal 1990. The major source of <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s sales gain in the fiscal first quarter was Sipco, formerly known as <ORGANIZATION> Swift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, which has annual sales in excess of $ 3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> acquired the remaining 50 percent of Sipco effective the beginning of fiscal 1990 and all Sipco sales were included in the fiscal first quarter. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said gains were made in the quarter in all three of <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s basic food industry segments. Consumer frozen foods earnings were up sharply in the largest industry segment, prepared foods. Poultry earnings advanced and operating profit moved up in the fresh red meat business as strong beef processing more than offset weak pork results, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> assumed control of 20 percent of the domestic poultry market last month with the completion of its $ 1.4 billion merger with <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>. The buyout followed a takeover struggle for Holly Farms that began last October and pitted Tyson against <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The chances of another stock market crash in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the next two years are about one-in-four, according to a poll of investment decision-makers released Tuesday. The poll, conducted by the Wall Street firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, found a higher expectation of a crash now than in similar surveys conducted in February and last October. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> surveyed 232 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who make investment decisions for institutions. They included chief investment officers and corporate financial officers at big companies, institutional portfolio managers for stocks and bonds, securities industry analysts and economists. On the average, the respondents saw a 26.6 percent chance of a crash in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> within two years. They also believe there is a 39.5 percent chance of a stock market slide in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in that period and a 23.9 percent probability of one occurring in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. That compares with average probabilities of 23.9 percent for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crash in a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> poll taken last February, 42.7 percent for one in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and 26.4 for one in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In October 1988, one year after the crash that rattled both Wall Street and world markets, the same survey found an average 22.8 percent chance for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 42.3 percent for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and 23.7 percent for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Brazilians Plan to Meet With Bankers in New York</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Brazilian Treasury minister comments.

<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Brazilian Treasury Minister <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> was quoted as saying Tuesday his country will resume payments on its huge foreign debt only if it receives $ 3 billion in pending credits from its lenders. `` The position of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> now is that if it receives the credits it will pay. Otherwise, no,'' the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> as saying. According to <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> expects to reach a temporary agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to obtain $ 3 billion in credits so it can renew service payments on its $ 110 billion foreign debt, the largest in the Third World. `` In May it was impossible to reach agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, but now there is confidence it can be achieved, which will allow funds to be liberated to cover our commitments with international banks,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has not declared a moratorium. It suspended payments because we did not have money and we have not received around $ 3 billion from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and creditor banks,'' he added. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> was quoted as saying the credits will tide his country over until whoever is elected president in November takes office in March 1990. He said the new government then will formulate a policy on the debt. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has not paid $ 1.6 billion in interest payments that came due Friday. Its officials plan to meet with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later this week. Brazilian officials said their country will not be seeking a deadline extension on on debt payments, as some reports have suggested. The treasury minister is part of a group of Brazilian government bankers attending a meeting in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort. Heads of federal reserve agencies from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are meeting to discuss international strategies to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON>, adviser on international relations in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, who spoke with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone, he denied that his government will ask the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> for a 90-day extension on debt payments <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> on Monday quoted <PERSON> Wadico </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucchi </PERSON>, a governor of the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, as saying <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> can not meet its obligations, but is seeking to gain time in order to receive a $ 600 million loan awaiting <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> approval that will be used to service the debt. <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Bucchi </PERSON> as saying he is sure the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> will grant the 90-day extension when he meets later this week with officials of that organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON> called this report `` a misunderstanding.'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has the biggest foreign debt in the Third World. The South American country has previously suspended payments and, according to news reports in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, such a moratorium would help maintain its reserves of $ 6 billion but would hurt its chances of obtaining fresh money from international lenders.

<HEAD>Sir James Loses Another Round in BAT Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> has lost another round in his attempt to block state regulators from reviewing his $ 21.1 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the British parent of <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saffels </PERSON> refused Monday to block the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review of the hostile takeover bid. Los Angeles-based Farmers, the 15th-largest insurance holding company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, operates in nine states. Insurance regulators in those states are reviewing BAT's proposed takeover to assure it is in the best interest of policyholders. Federal judges in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> already have denied similar requests by <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, for preliminary injunctions blocking review in those states. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, who contends state regulators have no constitutional right to review a foreign takeover, declined a request for comment Tuesday. Spokesmen said, however, that he intends to continue appealing the rulings. Because of the complexities of the state reviews, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> takeover monitoring panel last week gave him an unprecedented yearlong extension of his deadline to complete the takeover. As part of <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s proposal, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> would be sold to <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION>, a big French insurer, for $ 4.5 billion.

<HEAD>Lockheed Cited For 230 Alleged Health And Safety Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal agency Tuesday again cited <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, this time for 230 alleged health and safety violations at its aerospace manufacturing plants in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarita </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>. The violations, 114 of them categorized as posing `` substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result,'' include electrical hazards such as improper use of extension cords and inadequate grounding. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> levied $ 44,200 in fines for violations uncovered by inspectors during reviews of the three plants, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasheim </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional director in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Strasheim </PERSON> said most of the violations have been corrected. `` During the lengthy inspections, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> had significantly increased their safety and health staff and had placed renewed commitment to putting in place a system which will identify safety and health hazards and move to eliminate them,'' <PERSON> Strasheim </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> had fined <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> nearly $ 1.5 million in March for 440 violations of record keeping requirements and safety standards at its <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> plant. Those violations sparked comprehensive inspections at <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, the Rye Canyon plant in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarita </LOCATION> and at the sprawling <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> facility. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> `` knew or should have known of the hazard'' presented by the violations, which include inadequate guarding of machines and a lack of personal protective equipment such as safety gloves and respirators, <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> reports said. `` Our policy has been and will continue to be to work with <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> to ensure compliance with their regulations,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said in a statement.
