<HEAD>ATLANTA: the people.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We must defend the poor and deliver the needy. Today in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> there are more poor people than ever Most poor people are not black or brown. Most poor people are young, white and female. But what does it matter? Red, white, black or brown. A hungry baby's belly turned inside out _ color it hunger, color it pain. Most poor people are not on welfare, they work hard every day that they can. They sweep the streets. They work. They catch the early bus. They work. They pick up garbage. They work. They feed our children in school. They work. They take care of other people's children and can not care for their own. They work. They make the beds in the hotels we sleep in. They wear uniforms. No one refers to them by name. Hey you, here, go, do. They work every day that they can. They work in hospitals. They mop the floors. They wipe the fevered bodies of the sick. They empty their bed pans. They clean out their commodes. No job is beneath them. And yet, when they get sick, they can not lie in the bed they made up every day. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a better nation than that. We are a better nation than that. Leadership must address the high moral challenges of our day. In the nuclear age, war is irrational. Strong leadership can never let the desire to look tough stand in the way of the pursuit of peace. Leadership. We can take the lead to reverse the nuclear arms race. At the very least, we should pledge _ a pledge the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has already made _ that we will not be the first to start a nuclear war. First use leads to first retaliation and to mutual annihilation. Suicide is not a rational defense policy. We must choose another way. Leadership. We can build common security with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Shared efforts to work for peace. Joint ventures to wipe out malnutrition in the world, to explore the heavens, to develop them for peaceful purposes. Star Wars or a space development initiative. Redeem scientists held hostage by this mad arms race. Leadership. We must change our policy towards the Third World. Support international law. Respect self-determination. Defend human rights. Foster economic growth. Be consistent. Leaders must address the critical struggles in the world today. We can have peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Stop the illegal war on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and join the regional peace process that offers dialogue and hope.

 The young man once known to the country as `` John-John,'' son of the Democrats' martyred president, brought convention delegates to their feet cheering Tuesday night and told them: `` Because of you, he is with us still.'' And later, the five children of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> introduced their father, the candidate, to a hall so crowded they locked the doors. Hundreds of delegates, reporters, and convention guests were stopped by a police line after the fire marshal ordered that The Omni arena could hold no more. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> shared his big moment before the convention with the woman whose refusal to give up her seat on a bus in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, more than a quarter century ago began the turnaround in American race relations. `` All of you think you are seated,'' he said as he introduced <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>. `` But you're really standing on someone's shoulders.'' The convention hall was a waving sea of red `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>!'' signs as the runner-up in the nominee race appeared, after his children introduced him one-by-one. Not a single blue sign for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee-to-be, could be seen. The delegates to the Democratic National Convention had been a rather undemonstrative lot until they welcomed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> with a two-minute standing ovation. `` Over a quarter century ago, my father stood before you to accept the nomination for president,'' said the 27-year-old <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. And then he introduced his uncle, who he said inspired his generation. As if to show that the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> name still carries magic, the delegates stood and cheered again, for Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the dead president's brother and <PERSON> John-John </PERSON>'s Uncle Teddy. It was a fitting prelude for the big show yet to come, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s closing speech of his long campaign for the presidency <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a spellbinding speaker, did n't disappoint the convention. Until he arrived, many seats were still empty. Like magic, they filled. `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' he asked repeatedly. And the delegates responded with a cascading chant, `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>? Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' Said Kennedy: `` We all know the answer to all these questions. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the man who is never there. And he wo n't be there after the clock strikes noon on Jan. 20, 1989.'' In fact, Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the second speaker of the evening to bring up `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' Earlier in the evening, Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> recited a similar litany and got a similar response. The two speakers may have been telegraphing a battle cry for the campaign to come. The question caused banners to bob up and down in the hall. The red `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>!'' signs as well as the red-white and blue posters saying `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for President,'88.''

<TEXT>
 We can have peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Mutual recognition for mutual security, land for peace. We must know that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security and Palestinian self-determination are two sides of the same coin. Security for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its borders, its people. Justice for Palestinians _ peace for both. Reopen and expand Camp David. Help rebuild <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. And pursue peace in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Seek the release of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and hostages. We reach out to them tonight. We must have freedom in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Enforce comprehensive sanctions against the terrorist state. Get <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, support the front-line states in their struggle against South African aggression. We can act to end the austerity and desperation that burdens <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Engage our allies, relieve their debt, offer a Marshall Plan for growth and development. Their debt is a factor in our deficit. To do all of this we need bold leadership and a new direction. Our challenge is put forth in the words of a poem: We have mastered the air, conquered the sea, annihilated distance and prolonged life, but we are not wise enough to live on this earth without war and without hate. I am tired of sailing my little boat Far inside the harbor bar I want to go out where the big ships float Out on the deep where the great ones are. And should my frail craft prove too slight For waves that sweep those billows o'er, I'd rather go down in the stirring fight Than drowse to death by the sheltered shore. Author unknown. We can win. But we must not gain the whole world and lose our own soul. Our soul is our youth. We must not lose them to drugs, violence, premature pregnancy, suicide, cynicism, pessimism and despair. We must challenge our youth with high visions, hope and dreams. They must not be put in an environment or taught to submerge their dreams. Young people, I challenge you this night, exercise the right to dream. Face reality, but do n't stop with the way things are, dream of things as they ought to be. Face pain, but love, hope, faith and dreams will help you to rise above pain. Use hope and imagination as weapons of survival and progress. Use hope to motivate you and love to obligate you to serve the human race. Dream. Dream of peace. Choose the human race over the nuclear race. We must bury the weapons and not burn the people.

 Here is the text of the platform approved Tuesday night by the Democratic National Convention. The delegates added nine compromise amendments to the final platform. Five involved additional language on health care, the Cold War, a moratorium on flight testing of nuclear missiles, and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> incorporated in the passages below. Four others _ dealing with a `` comprehensive budget'' plank; pre-natal care, the <ORGANIZATION> Womens </ORGANIZATION>, Infants and Children program and Head Start; <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>; and education _ were contained in separate paragraphs that appear at the bottom. Democratic party officials said they were not yet certain where those four paragraphs will appear in the document.

<HEAD>The Restoration of Competence and the Revival of Hope</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We the people of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in order to initiate the changes necessary to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better, in order to restore competence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive branch and get it working again fairly for all Americans, and in order to secure for our children a future of liberty and opportunity, hereby pledge our party, our leaders, our elected officials and our every individual effort to fulfilling the following fundamental principles for all members of the American family. We believe that all Americans have a fundamental right to economic justice in a stronger, surer national economy, an economy that must grow steadily without inflation, that can generate a rising standard of living for all and fulfill the desire of all to work in dignity up to their full potential in good health with good jobs at good wages, an economy that is prosperous in every region, from coast to coast, including our rural towns and our older industrial communities, our mining towns, our energy producing areas and the urban areas that have been neglected for the past seven years. We believe that, as a first-rate world power moving into the 21st century, we can have a first-rate full employment economy, with an indexed minimum wage that can help lift and keep families out of poverty, with training and employment programs _ including child care and health care _ that can help people move from welfare to work, with portable pensions and an adequate Social Security system, safeguarded against emasculation and privatization, that can help assure a comfortable and fulfilling old age, with opportunities for voluntary national public service, above and beyond current services, that can enrich our communities, and with all workers assured the protection of an effective law that guarantees their rights to organize, join the union of their choice, and bargain collectively with their employer, free from anti-union tactics. We believe that the time has come for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to take charge once again of its economic future, to reverse seven years of `` voodoo economics,'' `` trickle down'' policies, fiscal irresponsibility, and economic violence against poor and working people that have converted this proud country into the world's largest debtor nation, mortgaged our children's future by tripling our national debt, placed home ownership out of reach for most young families, permitted the rise of poverty and homelessness on the streets of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, reduced the buying power of working men and women, and witnessed the decline of our industrial, natural resource and mining base, the unending tragedy of family farm foreclosures, an unhealthy dependence on foreign energy and foreign capital, and the increasing foreign ownership of our land and natural resources We believe that it is time for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, within a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility, to reassert progressive values and reinvest in its people, to invest in new priorities, in lifelong education and training, in targeted economic development, in a healthy small business community and in retooled <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry; that it is time for the broad revitalization of home town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, involving financial institutions in the provision of crucial credit by encouraging special commitments in exchange for bailing out those that are failing, reforming and expanding community reinvestment laws, and reversing the trend of financial concentration and deregulation, all combining to reverse the insecurity that has increasingly troubled our workers and their families in this rapidly changing society that has left some communities and regions behind. There is no good reason why the nation we love, the greatest and richest nation on earth, should rank first among the industrialized nations in output per person but nearly last in infant mortality, first in the percentage of total expenditures devoted to defense but nearly last in the percentage devoted to education and housing. We believe that government should set the standard in recognizing that worker productivity is enhanced by the principle of pay equity for working women and no substandard wage competition for public contracts; by family leave policies that no longer force employees to choose between their jobs and their children or ailing parents; by safe and healthy work places, now jeopardized by seven callous years of lowered and unenforced occupational safety standards for American workers; and by major increases in assistance making child care more available and affordable to low-and middle-income families, helping states build a strong child care infrastructure, setting minimum standards for health, safety, and quality, and thereby enabling parents to work and their children to get an early start on their education and personal fulfillment. We believe that the strength of our families is enhanced by programs to prevent abuse and malnutrition among children, crime, dropouts and pregnancy among teen-agers and violence in the family; by aggressive child support enforcement; and by emphasizing family preservation and quality foster care. We believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs more trade, fair trade, an administration willing to use all the tools available to better manage our trade in order to export more American goods and fewer American jobs, an administration willing to recognize in the formulation and enforcement of our trade laws that workers' rights are important human rights abroad as well as at home, and that advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs is not only fundamentally right but also economically sound. We believe that we can and must improve our competitiveness in the world economy, using our best minds to create the most advanced technology in the world through a greater commitment to civilian research and development and to science, engineering and mathematics training, through more public-private and business-labor cooperation and mutual respect, through more intergovernmental partnerships, and through a better balance between fiscal and monetary policy and between military and civilian research and development. We further believe in halting such irresponsible corporate conduct as unproductive takeovers, monopolistic mergers, insider trading, and golden parachutes for executives by reinvigorating our antitrust and securities laws, reviewing large mergers, and discouraging short-term speculation taking place at the expense of long-term investment.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: long-term investment.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We believe that the education of our citizens, from <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> to institutions of higher learning, deserves our highest priority, and that history will judge the next administration less by its success in building new weapons of war than by its success in improving young minds. We believe that this nation needs to invest in its children on the front side of life by expanding the availability of preschool education for children at risk; to invest in its teachers through training and enrichment programs, including a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to recruit teachers for tomorrow, especially minorities, with scholarships today; to commit itself for the first time to the principle that no one should be denied the opportunity to attend college for financial reasons; to ensure equal access to education by providing incentives and mechanisms for the equalization of financing among local school districts within each state; to reverse cuts made in compensatory reading, math and enrichment services to low-income children; and to expand support for bilingual education, historically black and Hispanic institutions, the education of those with special needs, the arts and humanities, and an aggressive campaign to end illiteracy. We believe that illegal drugs pose a direct threat to the security of our nation from coast to coast, invading our neighborhoods, classrooms, homes and communities large and small; that every arm and agency of government at every federal, state and local level _ including every useful diplomatic, military, educational, medical and law enforcement effort necessary _ should at long last be mobilized and coordinated with private efforts under the direction of a national drug `` czar'' to halt both the international supply and the domestic demand for illegal drugs now ravaging our country; and that the legalization of illicit drugs would represent a tragic surrender in a war we intend to win. We believe that this effort should include comprehensive programs to educate our children at the earliest ages on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse, readily available treatment and counseling for those who seek to address their dependency, the strengthening of vital interdiction agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION>, a summit of Western hemispheric nations to coordinate efforts to cut off drugs at the source, and foreign development assistance to reform drug-based economies by promoting crop substitution. We believe that the federal government should provide increased assistance to local criminal justice agencies, enforce a ban on `` cop killer'' bullets that have no purpose other than the killing and maiming of law enforcement officers, reinforce our commitment to help crime victims, and assume a leadership role in securing the safety of our neighborhoods and homes. We further believe that the repeated toleration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of unethical and unlawful greed among too many of those who have been governing our nation, procuring our weapons and polluting our environment has made far more difficult the daily work of the local policemen, teachers and parents who must convey to our children respect for justice and authority. We believe that we honor our multicultural heritage by assuring equal access to government services, employment, housing, business enterprise and education to every citizen regardless of race, sex, national origin, religion, age, handicapping condition or sexual orientation; that these rights are without exception too precious to be jeopardized by federal judges and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials chosen during the past years _ by a political party increasingly monolithic both racially and culturally _ more for their unenlightened ideological views than for their respect for the rule of law. We further believe that we must work for the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution; that the fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay; that our machinery for civil rights enforcement and legal services to the poor should be rebuilt and vigorously utilized; and that our immigration policy should be reformed to promote fairness, nondiscrimination and family reunification and to reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech, association and travel. We further believe that the voting rights of all minorities should be protected, the recent surge in hate violence and negative stereotyping combated, the discriminatory English-only pressure groups resisted, our treaty commitments with native Americans enforced by culturally sensitive officials, and the lingering effects of past discrimination eliminated by affirmative action, including goals, timetables, and procurement set-asides. We believe that the housing crisis of the 1980s must be halted _ a crisis that has left this country battered by a rising tide of homelessness unprecedented since the Great Depression, by a tightening squeeze on low - and moderate-income families that is projected to leave 7 million people without affordable housing by 1993, and by a bleak outlook for young working families who can not afford to buy their first home We believe that steps should be taken to ensure a decent place to live for every American. We believe that homelessness _ a national shame _ should be ended in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; that the supply of affordable housing should be expanded in order to avoid the projected shortfall; that employer-assisted housing and development by community based nonprofit organizations should be encouraged; that the inventory of public and subsidized housing should be renovated, preserved and increased; that foreclosed government property should be restored to productive use; and that first-time home buyers should be assisted. We believe that we can rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, creating good jobs at good wages through a national reinvestment strategy to construct new housing, repair our sewers, rebuild our roads and replace our bridges. We believe that we must pursue needed investment through innovative partnerships and creative financing mechanisms such as a voluntary program to invest a portion of public and private pension funds as a steady source of investment capital by guaranteeing security and a fair rate of return and assuring sound project management.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: project management.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We believe that all Americans should enjoy access to affordable, comprehensive health services for both the physically and mentally ill, from prenatal care for pregnant women at risk to more adequate care for our <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and other veterans, from well-baby care to childhood immunization to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>; that a national health program providing federal coordination and leadership is necessary to restrain health care costs while assuring quality care and advanced medical research; that quality, affordable, long-term home and health care should be available to all senior and disabled citizens, allowing them to live with dignity in the most appropriate setting; that an important first step toward comprehensive health services is to ensure that every family should have the security of basic health insurance; and that the HIV-AIDS epidemic is an unprecedented public health emergency requiring increased support for accelerated research on, and expedited <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval of, treatments and vaccines, comprehensive education and prevention, compassionate patient care, adoption of the public health community consensus on voluntary and confidential testing and counseling, and protection of the civil rights of those suffering from AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex or testing positive for the HIV antibody. We believe that the last seven years have witnessed an unprecedented assault on our national interest and national security through the poisoning of our air with acid rain, the dumping of toxic wastes into our water, and the destruction of our parks and shores; that pollution must be stopped at the source by shifting to new, environmentally sound manufacturing and farming technologies; that the federal government must promote recycling as the best, least costly way to solve the trash crisis, aggressively enforce toxic waste laws and require polluters to be responsible for future cleanup costs; that this nation must redouble its efforts to provide clean waterways, sound water management and safe drinkable ground water throughout the country; that our national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and coastal zones must be protected and used only in an environmentally sound manner; that all offshore oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas should be opposed; and that regular world environment summits should be convened by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to address the depletion of the ozone layer, the `` greenhouse effect,'' the destruction of tropical forests and other global threats and to create a global action plan for environmental restoration. We believe that all Americans, producers and consumers alike, benefit when food and fiber are produced not by a few large corporations and conglomerates but by hundreds of thousands of family farmers obtaining a fair price for their product; that the disastrous farm policies of the last seven years, despite record federal spending, have forced hundreds of thousands of families from their farms while others are struggling to survive; and that a workable agricultural policy should include supply management, reasonable price supports, soil conservation and protection of rural water quality, credit and foreclosure relief, the return of federally held foreclosed lands to minority, beginning and restarting farmers, the development of new uses and markets for American farm products, improved disaster relief, and the revitalization of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> through new sources of capital for rural business and new federal support for rural health care, housing, education, water supply and infrastructure. We further believe that no person should go to bed hungry and that we must renew the fight against hunger at home and abroad, make food available to those nations who need it and want it, and convene an international conference of food producing nations. We believe that a balanced, coherent energy policy, based on dependable supplies at reasonable prices, is necessary to protect our national security, ensure a clean environment, and promote stable economic growth and prosperity, both nationally and in our energy producing regions; that the inevitable transition from our present, nearly total dependence on increasingly scarce and environmentally damaging nonrenewable sources to renewable sources should begin now; that such a policy includes increased cooperation with our hemispheric neighbors, filling that <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, promoting the use of natural gas, methanol and ethanol as alternative transportation fuels, encouraging the use of our vast natural gas and coal reserves while aggressively developing clean coal technology to combat acid rain, and providing targeted new incentives for new oil and gas drilling and development, for the development of renewable and alternative sources of energy, and for the promotion of energy conservation. We believe that with these changes the country could reduce its reliance on nuclear power while insisting that all plants are safe, environmentally sound and assured of safe waste disposal. We believe that this country's democratic processes must be revitalized: by securing universal, same day and mail-in voter registration as well as registration on the premises of appropriate government agencies; by preventing the misuse of at-large elections, the abuse of election day challenges and registration roll purges, any undercounting in the national census, and any dilution of the one-person, one-vote principle; by ending discrimination against public employees who are denied the right to full political participation; by supporting statehood for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>; by treating the offshore territories under our flag equitably and sensitively under federal policies, assisting their economic and social development and respecting their right to decide their future in their relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; by empowering the commonwealth of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> with greater autonomy within its relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to achieve the economic, social and political goals of its people, and by giving it just and fair participation in federal programs; by assuring and pledging the full and equal access of women and minorities to elective office and party endorsement; and by minimizing the domination and distortion of our election by moneyed interests. We believe in a stronger <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ready to make the tough choices of leadership in an ever-dangerous world: militarily stronger in our overall defense and anti-terrorist capabilities and in the cohesion of our military alliances; economically stronger at home and in the global marketplace; intellectually stronger in the advances of our schools, science and technology; and spiritually stronger in the principles we exemplify to the world. We believe in a clearheaded, tough-minded, decisive <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy that will reflect the changing nature of threats to our security and respond to them in a way that reflects our values and the support of our people, a foreign policy that will respect our Constitution, our <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and our traditional democratic principles and will in turn be respected for its quiet strength, its bipartisan goals, and its steadfast attention to the concerns and contributions of our allies and international organizations. We believe that we must reassume a role of responsible active international leadership based upon our commitment to democracy, human rights and a more secure world; that this nation, as the world power with the broadest global interests and concerns, has a greater stake than any in building a world at peace and governed by law; that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it; and that to have reliable allies we must be a reliable ally.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: reliable ally.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We believe that our national strength has been sapped by a defense establishment wasting money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead of investing more in readiness and mobility; that our national strength will be enhanced by more stable defense budgets and by a commitment from our allies to assume a greater share of the costs and responsibilities required to maintain peace and liberty; and that as military spending and priorities change, government should encourage the conversion of affected military facilities and the retraining of workers to facilitate the creation of new forms of communication, space development and new peacetime growth and productivity. We believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, not by relaxing our vigilance on the assumption that long-range Soviet interests have permanently changed, not by toasting a tyrant-like <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining a stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat, by standing up to any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adversaries whenever necessary and sitting down with them whenever possible, by making clear our readiness to use force when force is required to protect our essential security commitments, by testing the intentions of the new Soviet leaders about arms control, emigration, human rights and other issues, and by matching them not merely in rhetoric but in reciprocal initiatives and innovation, which takes advantage of what may be the greatest opportunity of our lifetime to establish a new, mutually beneficial relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in which we engage in joint efforts to combat environmental threats, explore peaceful uses of space and eradicate disease and poverty in the developing world, and in a mutual effort to transform the arms race that neither side can win into a contest for people's minds, a contest we know our side will win. We believe in following up the INF Treaty, a commendable first step, with mutual, verifiable and enforceable agreements that will make significant reductions in strategic weapons in a way that diminishes the risk of nuclear attack by either superpower; reduce conventional forces to lower and equivalent levels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, requiring deeper cuts on the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact side; ban chemical and space weapons in their entirety; promptly initiate a mutual moratorium on missile flight testing and halt all nuclear weapons testing while strengthening our efforts to prevent the spread of these weapons to other nations before the nightmare of nuclear terrorism engulfs us all. We believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that recognizes not only the realities of East-West relations but the challenges and opportunities of the developing world; that will support and strengthen international law and institutions, promote human and political rights and measure them by one yardstick, and work for economic growth and development. We believe that we must provide leadership, compassion and economic assistance to those nations stunted by overwhelming debt, deprivation and austerity, and that we must work to promote active agreements between developing and industrial countries, and the major public and commercial lenders, to provide debt relief and rekindle and sustain economic growth and democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and the poorest continent, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which deserves special attention. We further believe that we must enlist the trade surplus nations to join with us in supporting new aid initiatives to fuel growth in developing countries that, though economically depressed, are rich in human and natural potential. We believe this country should work harder to stop the supplies of arms, from both East and West, that fuel conflict in regions such as the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Deeply disturbed that the current administration has too long abandoned the peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and consistently undermined it in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we believe that this country, maintaining the special relationship with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> founded upon mutually shared values and strategic interests, should provide new leadership to deliver the promise of peace and security through negotiations that has been held out to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors by the Camp David Accords and to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>, which calls for an end to the fighting, national reconciliation, guarantees of justice, freedom, human rights and democracy, an end to support for irregular forces, and a commitment by the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments to prevent the use of their territory to destabilize others in the region. Instead of the current emphasis on military solutions we will use negotiations and incentives to encourage free and fair elections and security for all nations in the region. We will cease dealing with drug smugglers and seek to reconcile our differences with countries in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, enabling the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries to focus on the pressing social and economic needs of the people of that region. We further believe in pursuing a policy of economic cooperation instead of confrontation with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and our other hemispheric friends; in helping all developing countries build their own peaceful democratic institutions free from foreign troops, subversion and domination and free from domestic dictators and aggressors; in honoring our treaty obligations; and in using all the tools at our disposal, including diplomacy, trade, aid, food, ideas, and ideals, to defend and enlarge the horizons of freedom on this planet. We believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that will promote human rights, human dignity and human opportunity in every country on earth; that will encourage free speech and association and decry oppression in nations friendly and unfriendly, communist and non-communist, that will encourage our European friends to respect human rights and resolve their longstanding differences over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>; that will encourage wherever possible the forces of pluralism and democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and that will support the struggle for human rights in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. We believe the apartheid regime in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be a uniquely repressive regime, ruthlessly deciding every aspect of public and private life by skin color, engaging in unrelenting violence against its citizens at home and promoting naked aggression against its neighbors in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. We believe that the time has come to end all vestiges of the failed policy of constructive engagement, to declare <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, to impose comprehensive sanctions upon its economy, to lead the international community in participation in these actions, and to determine a date certain by which <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> corporations must leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. We further believe that to achieve regional security in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, we must press forcefully for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence by calling for the end of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s illegal occupation, a cease fire and elections, must end our counterproductive policy in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and must offer support and further assistance to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and other frontline states. In sum, we believe it is time for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to change and move forward again in the interest of all its families _ to turn away from an era in which too many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children have been homeless or hungry and invest in a new era of hope and progress, an era of secure families in a secure <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in a secure world. We believe the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of opportunity for every citizen can be a reality for all Americans willing to meet their own responsibilities to help make it come true. We believe that governments at the national, state and local level, in partnerships between those levels and in partnerships with the private sector, exist to help us solve our problems instead of adding to them. We believe in competent, pragmatic governments, accountable to the people, led by men and women dedicated not to self interest but to service, motivated not by ideology but by American ideals, governing not in a spirit of power and privilege but with a sense of compassion and community. For many years, in state and local capitals across this nation, Democrats have been successfully solving problems and helping people with exactly this kind of innovative government. Therefore, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in convention assembled and united, the party of hope and change and fairness for all, hereby declares its readiness to end the stalemate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by challenging, encouraging and inviting the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people _ challenging them to do their patriotic best to meet their community responsibilities, encouraging them to protect and preserve their families, our most precious assets, and inviting them to join with us in leading the land we love to a brighter and still greater future of opportunity and justice for all.

<HEAD>COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We believe that it is time for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to meet the challenge to change priorities after eight years of devastating Republican policies, to reverse direction and reassert progressive values, to reinvest in its people within a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility. If we are seriously to pursue our commitments to build a secure economic future for all Americans we must provide the resources to care for our newborns, educate our children, house the homeless, heal the sick, wage total war on drugs and protect the environment.

 We further believe that our nation faces a crisis of underinvestment in our children, particularly in the early years of life. Strong, healthy babies with early opportunities that foster intellectual, emotional and physical growth begin school with an enhanced foundation for learning. There are few better investments for this country than prenatal care, infant nutrition and preschool education, and there are few more successful programs than WIC, <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, and prenatal care. We know what works; yet these successful programs have been starved for funds.

 Communist rebels rejected new peace talks with President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> as a `` farce'' Monday, charging her government and the military merely wanted to trap leaders of the 19-year-old insurgency. Self-styled communist rebels meanwhile killed a provincial official Monday and a guerrilla spokesman warned of more killings as long as the government fails, he said, to prosecute human rights violators in the military. The general command of the communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement sent by courier to news agencies, claimed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government lost its credibility following the collapse of peace talks last year Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has said she would agree to new peace talks if the rebels made the first move. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the 250,000-member armed forces would abide by her decision. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> earlier turned down the possibility of reviving the talks, saying it would only give the rebels time to regroup. `` The president has spoken,'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> told reporters. `` I do n't think there is anyone that will oppose any objective such as obtaining peace, but it must be peace with justice and honor. The rebel statement was in response to a call last week by the influential <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>' Conference of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> for the government and the guerrillas to call for a new cease-fire and revive peace talks. `` History repeats itself twice: the first as tragedy, the second as farce,'' the statement said. `` We can not ... respond positively to a call for a new cease-fire that will mean the annihilation of the revolutionary movement and its mass base. We have learned our lessons well from the duplicity of the Aquino government and its military establishment.'' The rebels accused the government of insincerity and charged that `` what the government and the military establishment sought to lay down was a trap that played on the good faith of the leaders of the revolutionary movement.'' About five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and dozens of its regional leaders were captured by the military in raids after the 60-day cease-fire lapsed in February 1987. On Sunday, the rebels' southern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> command said it was agreeable to peace talks in principle but claimed the government was setting unacceptable conditions. In a related development, police said two men who claimed to be communist guerrillas barged into a government office on Monday in <LOCATION> Lucena </LOCATION>, 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, and shot dead city councilor <PERSON> Donaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfaro </PERSON>, 54. <PERSON> Alfaro </PERSON> belonged to a government group organized to help the military curb rebel infiltration of local neighborhoods. <PERSON> Arnel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandoval </PERSON>, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Alex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boncayao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, justified the guerrillas' continuing attacks on police, soldiers and government officials by claiming the government failed to prosecute `` notorious police and military human rights violators.'' The brigade is a Manila-based unit of the rebel army that has claimed responsibility for killing more than 100 police, soldiers and officials during the past year. In <LOCATION> Bulacan </LOCATION> province, police Monday arrested two suspected rebels who killed a policeman a day earlier in <LOCATION> Baliwag </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. A gunman Monday fatally shot Vice Mayor <PERSON> Daud </PERSON> <PERSON> Talib </PERSON> on the island of <LOCATION> Jolo </LOCATION>, about 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, police said. The area is a stronghold of Moslem separatist guerrillas.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On the Sabbath, at <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> considered the week to come and led a crowd of 1,300 in a chant that had become his convention rallying cry. `` Never surrender,'' he implored. `` Never surrender.'' That was Sunday. On Monday the convention dawned and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> unveiled a new, more conciliatory chorus. He did not surrender, but with the gavel about to fall, he faced reality and _ to use <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' language _ agreed to let the quarterback call the plays. Following the unity news conference between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> led 2,000 supporters and delegates in quite a different cadence: `` Discipline, Details, Hope.'' The summit allowed both men to declare victory, and for once <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got in the final word. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, looking ahead to Wednesday night's presidential roll call, could not yet endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, explaining gracefully, almost sorrowfully, `` I'm still looking for a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> miracle.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' gentle rejoinder: `` I do n't think we're going to have a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> miracle ... we're going to have an Athenian miracle. Actually, it was something of a miracle to finally see these two fellows together after more than a month of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s patented `` creative tension.'' As expected, precious little was being said publicly about Monday's meeting. Were <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> chatting friendly-like about the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream and the need for Democratic unity, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suggested, or were they simply splitting up the spoils of Democratic patronage? Either way, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` There's no deal.'' No deal is a good deal for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Maybe it's even true _ although that seems farfetched. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> provided only one hint of his meeting-of-the-minds with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying `` When the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets on Friday, it will be more reflective of the new <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said _ maybe a dozen times a day for the last few days _ that he wanted equity and `` shared responsibility'' with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. To put flesh on the bone, his aides put a handful of demands on the table, according to reliable party sources who declined to be identified by name. The sources described several of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> requests as pretty routine stuff: A greater role at the <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION>. An expense-paid presence during the fall campaign. New language on some platform planks. `` If the man's got to travel, we're not going to let him fly commercial,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter who has been involved in the negotiations. `` Make no mistake about it. What <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> needs, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> will get.'' But then there was the explosive issue of transition guarantees. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> negotiators want the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> team to hire <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters for a hefty number of positions in the transition effort should <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> be elected in November. How many? One source shrugged and said, perhaps in joking, `` Half?'' Said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` It's not right to be in the seats on the floor tonight and not in the budget next January.'' This might not sit well with many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters who will want to think they are pulling the lever for Dukakis-Bentsen in November. `` Is <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> going to call the shots? If he is, there are a lot of Americans who are n't going to vote for this ticket,'' said Republican strategist <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> on Monday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> knows <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could make hay with an agreement to share the transition with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would never mention the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket; he'd call it the <PERSON> Dukakis-Jackson </PERSON> ticket at his first campaign stop in the morning and he'd add a last stop in the evening to do it again. He'd say, I'll tell you who's going to set up a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ me. Sources said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not present the transition issue in the face-to-face meeting; he knew, surely, that whether or not the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> demands were routine or outrageous, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could not be seen as giving in to them. He needs to exhibit leadership, not timidity _ it's a fact of life as the campaign moves from the Democratic convention to the general election campaign. Oddly enough, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> probably was in no particular hurry to sign onto a public deal with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> anyway. He has 1,100 partisans at this convention, many of them more ideologically motivated than he, and bargaining for spoils is not exactly something <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants to explain. A deal. No way, suggested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Using the same words he did in 1984 as he headed for a platform fight, he said on Monday: `` If you negotiate away your self respect, you lose before you get to the floor. We can afford to lose a vote. We can not afford to lose our self-respect.''

 When dry cleaning shop owner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Castiglione </PERSON> realized the robber shooting at the ceiling Monday was firing a harmless cap gun, she got in a few licks of her own. She hit the man repeatedly on the face and shoulders with a stapler before he fled. `` I was fed up,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Castiglione </PERSON>, 48, who has been robbed before. `` And when he shot the gun and I realized it was a cap gun, I became very angry.'' The man brandishing what looked like a real revolver entered the R.J. Valet Cleaners in downtown <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> shortly after noon. Ms. <PERSON> Castiglione </PERSON> said the man demanded money and began firing the cap gun. She pounded on him with the stapler, but when she slammed the cash register shut, some bills flew into the air. The man grabbed between $ 30 and $ 50 and fled, escaping in a car, she said.

<HEAD>Iranian Move Could Lead to Reduction in US Gulf Presence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prospect of an end to the Iran-Iraq war is raising the possibility that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be able to reduce its military presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, administration officials say. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> alluded to that possibility Monday after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to accept a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` We have always said that as hostilities end and as the war ends, we were willing to consider a withdrawal,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is on a weeklong vacation. Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> spoke in a similar vein last week when he said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence will revert to more `` normal and traditional levels'' as tensions in the area abate. It was just a year ago this week that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began escorting Kuwaiti tankers operating as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag vessels in the gulf, the key element of what has been a substantial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military buildup in the waterway. According to official figures, the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel in the region has increased from 2,000 to more than 15,000, while <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships now total 27, compared with six less than three years ago. The deployment has stirred intense controversy in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere, particularly after the extensive loss of lives in two instances of mistaken identity. When an Iraqi jet fired on the USS Stark in May 1987, 37 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were killed. And 290 passengers died on July 3 when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship shot down an Iranian civilian aircraft. As a show of regret, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> offered to pay compensation following the Stark incident, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did the same after the downing of the Iranian plane. The American commitment to the gulf has been costly in other ways. The deployment has forced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to postpone ship overhauls and to reduce some forces normally assigned elsewhere, including <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> called the Iranian acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution a `` major breakthrough'' that opens the way for an end to what has been the longest running large-scale war of the 20th century. They also said the Iranian decision could restore stability to the gulf region. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` do n't have a reading with any real definition'' on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s intentions, and he cautioned that ending the war `` is not going to occur overnight.'' An end to the conflict would remove one of three impediments to a more normal relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Diplomatic ties were broken in April 1980 during the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hostage crisis, five months before the Iran-Iraq war broke out. The other conditions the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said are necessary for a friendlier relationship are the release of the Americans being held hostage by pro-Iranian militants in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and an end to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s alleged promotion of international terrorism. Iranian officials have made several inquiries of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent months about improving diplomatic ties but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has not followed up on them except to ask whether the overtures were made by officials in positions of authority. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has said no response has been received. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> apparently decided to accept a cease-fire because of the country's declining economy and fading popular support for continuation of the war. Beyond that, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops have scored major gains in recent months, leaving the forces of the two sides deployed roughly along the international border of the two countries. The officials said this would enable the combatants to reach a final settlement without either being forced to surrender territory to the other.

 Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s conclusion that Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> probably violated tax and conflict-of-interest laws wo n't hurt <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> politically, a top aide to the vice president says. `` I would n't go as far as to say it's a dead issue, but it's not going to be a central concern, in my judgment, when voters go vote in November,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said Monday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides contend that, for all practical purposes, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ceased to be a major political liablity for the vice president, the certain Republican presidential nominee, when <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on July 6 announced he would resign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, troubled by the accusations against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, previously had sought to make ethics in government a major campaign theme, calling for a tougher conflict-of-interest standard for all officials. However, the vice president had insisted he would not comment on the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> matter until the release of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report. When that report was delivered on Monday, the vice president was not available for comment. He was in a remote part of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> on a 4 -LCB- - day fishing trip with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that began on Saturday Speaking on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said of the newly released report: `` It's not going to have anything to do with this election.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably willfully filed a false income tax return, failed to pay taxes on time and broke a criminal conflict-of-interest law. The independent counsel said he would not seek criminal charges against the attorney general, however. Meanwhile in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, one of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s more outspoken Democratic critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said he did n't believe <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report would have any effect on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' candidacy. `` I do n't think there is any partisan advantage or should there be a partisan advantage,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., whose <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> governmental oversight subcommittee investigated <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement with the scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't think <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is a partisan Republicans called for his resignation as well as Democrats,'' said <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, who was attending the Democratic National Convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the past has said that the attorney general should be held to `` a high ethical standard'' and that he found some of the allegations against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> particularly troubling. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, by resigning, took away the McKay report as a campaign issue. The official said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had n't been bombarded by questions on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> since the attorney general announced he would step down. Before then, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been asked at nearly every campaign stop whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should resign. When <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced he would step down as attorney general and said he was vindicated by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a terse statement: `` <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> did the right thing and I wish him well.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would deliver a major speech on ethics in government within the next few weeks. `` I do n't want to upstage him on it. The speech is n't complete.'' Campaign sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ethics proposals, long in the works, had been delayed to await the McKay report. In the past, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said the new code he will outline `` will help us avoid the excesses of the past.'' `` People should come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to serve, not to profit,'' the vice president said in a recent campaign appearance. `` When a congressman goes bad, or a member of the executive branch betrays the public trust, you know and I know that it hurts.'' Before <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced his plans to resign, two top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides _ pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> and former communications director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> _ said publicly that the attorney general had become a major campaign liability for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign aides said they had not heard from the presumptive Republican presidential candidate since before he began the fishing trip. `` He must be catching a lot of fish,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said. He planned reappear on Wednesday _ the next-to-last day of the Democratic convention _ with campaign appearances in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, and also was to campaign daily at least through Sunday.

<HEAD>EPA Said To Bow To Political Pressure In Oil Wastes Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> relied on `` solely political reasons'' to reject a staff recommendation that some oil and gas drilling wastes be more strictly regulated, an agency employee says. `` Politics overrode science and we've never done that before,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, assistant to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of the hazardous site control division. `` This is the first time in the history of environmental regulation of hazardous wastes that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has exempted a powerful industry from regulation for solely political reasons, despite a scientific determination of the hazardousness of the wastes,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> and another staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Sens. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., pressured the agency, as did the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> departments and some states <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrators deny their call was swayed by political pressure. The majority of an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> working group that studied the issue had recommended that a small volume of drilling wastes come under stringent regulation as hazardous. But EPA Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response, said in a June 30 report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they had decided that all oil and gas drilling wastes would remain exempt from hazardous waste rules <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said it was `` certainly a close call ... not an easy decision,'' but that his `` conscience is clear.'' So-called `` associated wastes'' account for 1 percent of the total volume of drilling wastes but contain highly toxic materials such as benzene, heavy metals and corrosive acids that are regulated as hazardous in other industries, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> staff said. It concluded the wastes pose a threat to the environment if not handled properly and that states are largely doing a poor job of enforcing existing regulations. A draft staff report said the cost to the industry to regulate those materials as hazardous wastes would have ranged from $ 200 million to $ 500 million a year. `` However, relative to total production and the total volume of product, the overall impacts on the industry should not be unduly burdensome,'' the report said. `` It would have been a fly in the economic health of that industry,'' said <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, a frequent public critic of top-level agency decisions. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> and officials responding to his accusations spoke in interviews last week. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> agreed with the staff position that many states do not adequately regulate drilling wastes, but said another layer of regulation was not the answer. Hazardous waste laws can be inflexible and are not necessarily appropriate for the nation's hundreds of thousands of oil and gas wells, he said <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> that although the working group had wanted to regulate the low-volume wastes as hazardous, `` we now feel that removing any portion of the exemption would be too disruptive and burdensome to both the regulated industry and the regulating agencies.'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said the costs would have posed a huge economic burden on an industry staggered by three years of low prices. Of the senator's push against the regulations, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said: `` If we'd do it again tomorrow, we'd do it just as strong.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, tapped by Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to be his running mate, said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision was `` by and large sound, though there are some areas that may require further clarification and explanation.'' <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> said additional regulations would have hurt people `` already on their backs economically'' and that states are doing a decent job.

<HEAD>EPA Names Six Sensitive Coastal Areas For Study</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has added six major estuaries to a list of ecologically sensitive coastal areas targeted for study on ways to improve their health and clean them up. Placed on the list Monday were <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Del </PERSON>.; the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Estuaries _ where rivers meet the sea, and fresh water mixes with salt water _ serve as the principal spawning grounds and nurseries for at least two-thirds of the nation's commercial fisheries and are home to valuable and diverse species of fish, shellfish and wildlife, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said They also are sources of `` irreplaceble recreation and aesthetic enjoyment,'' the agency said. `` Estuaries are clearly in trouble, threatened by toxic and bacterial contamination, industrial and municipal sewage discharges, agricultural runoff, oxygen-depleted waters and loss of fish and wildlife habitat,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regional administrator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Under the National Estuary Program, the bay studies are designed to come up with recommendations for long-term strategies for pollution control and resource management, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said the studies, which can take as long as five years, are a joint effort of the agency and state and local officials, with states contributing 25 percent of the costs. The estuary program was established as part of the Water Quality Act of 1987 to identify and protect significant estuaries. A dozen estuaries are targeted for priority in the program, including the six named Monday. The other six were included in the program last year _ Albemarle-Pamlico Sound, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buzzards </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; Puget Sound, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Effectiveness of U.S. Aid To Egypt Questioned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two government reports question the effectiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and cast doubt on whether the aid has brought about policy changes sought by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> study of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to seven countries, of which <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the most populous, concluded that the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> has had `` mixed success'' in encouraging foreign policy reforms. Another report, from AID Inspector General <PERSON> Hebert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckington </PERSON>, criticized the use of $ 1.5 billion worth of machinery and equipment sent to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> between 1975 and 1986. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> got $ 819.7 million in `` economic support funds'' from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in fiscal 1987, second only to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. AID spokesman <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said Monday that $ 115 million of the aid was transferred in cash to the government of President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. Most of the rest was spent on projects designed to raise the country's standard of living. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said the cash transfer to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was based on a document that described broad policy changes that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government expected from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> but gave no details on how progress would be measured. The report, dated June 29 and made public this month, added that while the document listed Egyptian policy reforms since the previous transfer, it did not explain their meaning or how they related to what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sought. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has not moved quickly enough to adopt the economic reforms necessary to address the numerous and costly inefficiencies that pervade the Egyptian economy,'' it said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in a comment included in the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, said there are countries where setting reform targets in advance will fuel political opposition on the grounds that foreigners are dominating economic policy. `` In some situations a less specific economic reform program ... may be preferable to a highly specific program with unrealistic expectations,'' <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for economic affairs, stated in the report. The AID report on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s use of U.S.-financed machinery and equipment blamed the inability of the Egyptian government, AID and contractors to coordinate procurement with actual construction. `` Large amounts were either not being used or used at levels much below what was anticipated,'' the report said of the equipment. The report, issued about the same time as the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> document, also cited `` the limited capability of government of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> entities to operate and maintain machinery and equipment.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> devoted his 30-year congressional career to working for a stronger defense, but it was n't until a Republican administration came into power that he saw his hawkish philosophy return to political vogue. `` I think that a lot of the difficulties that we have today on the subject of defense -LRB- are -RRB- primarily a matter of a generation gap,'' he once said. `` Those of us who ... watched the rise of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> recognize that military power is something that is very necessary to protect a free society. Costly and dangerous, but absolutely necessary.'' <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> strongly backed the Vietnam War and believed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have made a firmer commitment there. After the war, when defense became politically unpopular, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> stuck to his guns, going so far as to become the only <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> among the `` boll weevils,'' a group of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pushing for stronger defense. `` I've found in the last couple of terms that whenever I'm trying to get support on a particular measure, like not withdrawing troops from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or providing a more active response to the hostage situation, it was usually the Southerners who would line up in support,'' <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> said in 1980 <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>'s position got a boost with the 1980 election of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as federal spending shifted toward military buildup after years of what the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrat considered overemphasis on social spending. <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>'s son-in-law announced Monday that the 71-year-old congressman, a long-time asthma sufferer, wo n't seek a 16th term. The family spokesman, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, cited <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>'s health. Throughout his career, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> has favored most proposed increases in defense spending and new weapons systems, including the B1 bomber, MX missile and neutron bomb. He was a leading congressional opponent of a nuclear freeze proposal and has been wary of arms control agreements. But he considers himself a middle-of-the-road Democrat, and has voted for such `` liberal'' causes as a national minimum welfare payment, against an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution and, more recently, for economic sanctions against the South African government. `` The liberals think I'm too conservative and the conservatives think I'm too liberal,'' he once said. But <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>'s defense positions have overshadowed his other work in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Perhaps <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>'s biggest disappointment was in never achieving his ambition to be chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> voted out the armed services committee's elderly chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, D-Ill., but chose the much younger and less senior Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., over <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>, who was then the second-ranking In 1986, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> was among those who opposed <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> as the caucus voted not to make him chairman again. However, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> won the chair back in 1987, and <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> had to content himself with heading the subcommittee on procurement and military nuclear systems. Because of his role in procurement, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> was among those congressmen recently rumored to be targets of the ongoing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> probe. He has not been charged with any crime, however, and has denied any involvement in the investigation. <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> was born in 1916 in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, N.Y. He attended school in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION>. He holds masters degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Haverford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He was commissioned as an ensign in the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in 1942, and served in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> during World War II as a naval combat intelligence officer on the staff of Gen. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON>. He was twice awarded the Bronze Star and retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> at the rank of captain. A former mayor of <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1958. He was the first Democrat since 1916 to be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from what was then <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 32nd Congressional District. Despite several redistrictings by the Republicans to force him out, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> has returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with ease every two years from what is now the 23rd Congressional District. He has been dean of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> delegation since 1978. As <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION> mayor in the 1950s, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> fulfilled a campaign promise to clean up the city by leading a police raid on a gambling den in the shadow of City Hall. He also sparked an investigation that led to the resignation of the police chief. But because the pay from his official post was small, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> supplemented his income by becoming an announcer and newscaster for several local radio and television stations. He also appeared on TV as the character `` <PERSON> Sagebrush </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' who dressed as a cowboy and played harmonica. In 1962, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> attempted to shift his focus to statewide politics, seeking the gubernatorial nomination. But party leaders gave the nod to then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON>. In 1964, <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> thought he had a better shot at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, but his effort was thwarted when <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> entered the fray.

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has nothing but angry words for a $ 1.7 million investigation into his ethics that he believes both vindicates him and will allow him to ask the government to pay his legal fees. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> ended a 14-month investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> by issuing a lengthy report Monday while making no formal charges. But the report precipitated an immediate war of words between <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his lawyers and <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. After court personnel handed out 6-inch-thick piles of documents to more than 100 journalists who had waited in line as long as 2 -LCB- hours at the federal court building, the combatants began a string of news conferences at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> compared <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> to a `` hit-and-run'' driver for accusing the attorney general of crimes and then running away from filing charges. `` It was a cheap shot,'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said. He called the investigation `` a total bust, a colossal blunder'' and scoffed at the prosecutor's 814-page report, downplaying the length of his own filing which was nearly as thick but printed on only one side of each page. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said his rebuttal, with sections titled `` Fishing in Foreign Policy Water,'' `` The Empty Net'' and `` Procrastination is not Willfulness,'' was more readable than <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> accused <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> of stretching statutes `` beyond what any reasonable prosecutor would do,'' of trying to make an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> pipeline project look like `` the opening of a McDonald's franchise in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'' and of making groundless accusations to justify the high cost of his fruitless investigation. An hour later, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> held his own news conference and repeated for television cameras the accusations made against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in his report: that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> filed a false tax return, missed a tax filing deadline and dealt with two separate matters that might affect the telephone industry while holding stock in a local telephone company. In addition, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, both in the report and at the news conference, of insensitivity in dealings as a government official with his close friend, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. But <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he was using his `` prosecutorial discretion'' not to bring formal charges against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> because such offenses ordinarily would not lead to prosecution of a person who was not attorney general. He said neither <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> nor his wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, had a history of tax evasion and he had no evidence that the attorney general took any of the illegal actions for personal gain or that he deliberately lied. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> defended the high cost of the investigation. `` I did n't spend it personally,'' he quipped `` I feel confident we have not wasted any government funds, any of the taxpayers' money.'' Asked how he would respond to a lawsuit from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> if one were filed, he said, `` I've been sued before.'' Finally, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> strode into the same hall where <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> had just appeared, angrily defending all his actions _ and attacking <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. `` I'm glad that finally the long ordeal is over,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` But I'm outraged at the tarnishing of our system of justice that has gone on this afternoon and with the filing of this report by the independent counsel. `` I am appalled that <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> came in front of you and violated every principle of fairness and decency.'' `` I've always acted legally, ethically and properly,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said, `` and any implication by the independent counsel that I have in any way violated any law is absolutely false.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said it went against the American judicial system for a court official to publicly accuse someone of a crime and then not file charges. `` If anybody did that in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, they'd be fired,'' he said. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he would not disclose whether he would take any legal action against <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, but he said he would ask the government to pay his legal expenses which lawyer <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> said were approaching $ 250,000 six months ago. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he did n't know how much the total bill would be.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> still feels <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has been `` an outstanding attorney general'' despite an independent counsel's finding that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> likely violated tax and conflict-of-interest statutes. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Monday that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believes <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` will be able to look back with great satisfaction on the contributions he has made to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and to the administration of justice in general.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is vacationing with his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, at the couple's secluded ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, has never wavered in his support of his longtime <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> adviser and political confidant And the voluminous report by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, which said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> conceivably could have been prosecuted on a number of matters, did not change the president's thinking. `` The president is pleased that, after extensive scrutiny, the independent counsel did not charge the attorney general with any criminal wrongdoing,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at a briefing at an oceanfront hotel. His remarks closely paralleled the statement that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made in behalf <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> earlier this month when the attorney general pronounced himself vindicated because he was not indicted and announced he was resigning, effective in late July or early August. The Reagan White House seemed taken aback by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s announcement, even though it said the attorney general had alerted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> months earlier to the fact he did not plan to remain until the end of the administration next January <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> subsequently nominated former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> as <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s replacement, and the administration has said it hopes <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> can be confirmed easily by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. There have been no immediate problems on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, although the confirmation hearings remain to be held. In the lengthy report released Monday, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably violated the law in the sense that the attorney general failed to file his income tax form on time in 1985 and that the report failed to disclose a substantial capital gains income by the attorney general. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> likely could have been prosecuted for a violation of federal conflict-of-interest statutes for taking part in meetings regarding the telephone industry while still holding $ 14,000 in regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone stock. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said White House officials were in the process of reviewing the McKay report, but he said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his attorneys had released a document `` which refutes the issues at hand.'' Asked whether the McKay report in effect cast a new legal cloud over <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, the spokesman said, `` The attorney general has filed a lengthy statement saying no.'' Without commenting specifically on the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> matter, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, on the day his nomination was announced by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on July 5, said he would follow such a case wherever the evidence leads. There have been widespread reports that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is prepared to join the conservative-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a research organization, after he leaves office. There also have been reports that he might become a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a similarly conservative think tank. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was defending <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> through his spokesman Monday, the White House announced the resignation of a close associate of recently resigned chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had accepted the resignation of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, an economics adviser who is returning to private life The spokesman said <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> `` has been an integral part of the president's economic team, playing an important role in many major issues, including the trade bill, budget matters and general economic planning.'' He sought to minimize speculation that there is an exodus of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> associates from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, noting that the current chief of staff, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON>, is a close <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> friend. Both <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> communications director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON>, who had been <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s spokesman for years during <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s days in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, resigned last month <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he was leaving for personal reasons, including the health problems of his wife, Joy. <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON> said he wanted to accept a position at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee-Chattanooga </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Duberstein </PERSON> will hold a high-level meeting of senior <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aides here Thursday. `` It's just a planning meeting by the senior staff to go over the last six months, to talk about agenda and themes, issues, campaign activities, all those kinds of things,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A 14-month investigation into the financial dealings of <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> concluded that a real estate magnate and a confidant of the attorney general `` may have had ulterior motives'' in helping arrange a $ 40,000-a-year salary for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, in the final report on his investigation, also said he found no evidence to show that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` was aware of such motives.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, whose report was made public Monday, brought no charges against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> or anyone else. The 814-page report says that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> confidant <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> received a $ 200,000 loan from real estate magnate <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> this February, shortly before investigators looked into their roles in funding a job for <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. It was their involvement in arranging Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary on which <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> questioned their motives. In their rebuttals, attorneys for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> objected to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s references to their clients' possible `` ulterior motives.'' As for the loan, <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s lawyers said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said the money was needed for his legal fees because the government had frozen his assets. They said the loan was disclosed to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and the federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is under indictment for trying to peddle his influence with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said that in return for the $ 200,000, <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> received a promissory note from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and a deed of trust on real property owned by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. A separate agreement provided that <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> would advance <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` additional funds up to a total of $ 500,000 if a deed of trust in the amount of $ 525,000 were delivered to Mr. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said. This was one of several new elements turned up by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> in his investigation of an incident in 1985 when <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, head of a wealthy <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> real estate family, donated $ 40,000 for Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s salary. The money was to be paid by the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, where she had previously worked as a volunteer. The donation coincided with efforts by a <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> real estate partnership to renew a lucrative lease on office space in the Chester A. Arthur Building for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agencies. The lease was renewed at increased rent more than a year after the donation and the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership quickly sold the building for 60 percent more than it had paid for it about two years earlier. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> revealed that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> brought Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s desire for a paid job to the attention of the Benders. But <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he turned up no information that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was aware of <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s interest in the building or took any role in the lease renewal. In their rebuttal, <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s lawyers said he had only a 10 percent to 11 percent interest in the partnership. `` There is no basis in the report for the conclusion ... that Mr. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> may have had ` ulterior motives' in supporting the November 1985 contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which was used by that reputable charity to provide employment to <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s attorneys wrote. They said the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family foundation made the grant because they believed in Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s abilities to direct development of a job match program for MS victims. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said the reference to ulterior motives on <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s part is `` gratuitous and without any factual foundation.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also disclosed that Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> received $ 15,000 in advances on her salary in both 1985 and 1986. He said the society had no prior history of giving such advances and she testified she needed them to pay bills.

<HEAD>Chinese Loot Watermelons In Annual Summer Rite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of peasants rioted in a ripe watermelon field and hundreds of urban dwellers looted a melon stand, official reports said, in the latest replay of the melon madness that hits <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> each summer. Participants in similar melon-looting sprees last summer received heavy prison terms, and growers and sellers this year have resorted to hiring police guards _ apparently to little avail. Chinese eat millions of watermelons during the summer _ nearly at a rate of one a day per person in cities _ and some literally go mad over them. In one of the latest looting incidents, about 2,000 peasants swarmed onto a melon field in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province and snatched 500,000 pounds of the juicy fruit in raids July 8 and 9. The Legal Daily -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fazhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribao </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- on Monday carried a blurry picture of dozens of people running through the field, grabbing melons in both arms. It said police tried to restore order but were roughed up by the looters. The growers, 25 peasants who had jointly contracted to plant the land, `` could only put their heads down and cry in the fields,'' the national newspaper said. In a separate incident in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION> province, the Legal Daily said hundreds of people in <LOCATION> Songjianghe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> looted a melon stand over several days in early July, grabbing 60,000 pounds of melon. At first, the melon owner had hired `` protectors'' who fended off thieves, but three men beat up the protectors on July 6 and several hundred people began snatching fruit, the report said. Several suspected looters were arrested but all later were released without charges, it said without elaborating. In last summer's most spectacular melon riot, nearly 100 melon vendors raided a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> train depot where farmers had brought in melons under contract to other vendors. The raiders beat up some of the farmers and made off with 55,000 pounds of the fruit. Two of the thieves were sentenced to life in prison and six recieved two to 12 years in jail. Also last summer, more than 100 people in <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION> province jumped on trucks carrying melons into the provincial capital, <LOCATION> Jilin </LOCATION>, and stole 22,000 pounds. Farmers and bystanders who tried to protect shipment were beaten. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> authorities announced measures in June to ensure an adequate supply of melons to the city at controlled prices, partly in hopes of heading off violent grabs for the fruit. They lifted the usual ban on bringing tractors and horse-drawn carriages into the city center so that farmers could easily get the melons to market, and set up designated melon marketplaces. So far, no melon violence has been reported in the capital.

 The six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen wounded in an apparent grenade attack in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> are in very good condition following the weekend incident in which an explosive device was thrown at their automobile, the Pentagon says. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Monday released the names of five of six. The name of the sixth wounded man was not released because his family has not been notified, said Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The names of the five, their services, home bases and hometowns were: <PERSON> Elbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> specialist assigned from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and originally from <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> specialist, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, originally from <LOCATION> Ebensburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, originally from <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Keesler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, originally from <LOCATION> Gardena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> specialist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, originally from <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was treated and released Sunday and the other five were said to be in `` very good condition'' at the <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> Air Base in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The six were wounded in the parking lot of the Confetti discotheque in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, 125 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>. The disco is frequented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said no one had claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier reports said four men had been wounded, but doctors at <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> said another man was hit by sharpnel and a sixth had injured an ankle. The wounded men were among 150 servicemen on a one-day recreation leave from <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION>. Following the incident, all were recalled to the air base as a precaution, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire plan comes almost exactly a year after the start of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> convoy operation that led to a massive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval buildup and armed clashes with Iranian forces. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said they would adopt a `` wait and see'' position on whether, when and how the Persian Gulf-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet of about 17 ships would be affected, should the eight years of Iraq-Iran hostilities indeed be ended. As <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s surprise announcement was reported by its official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, the 48th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> convoy of 1988 and the 70th in the past year was en route up the gulf. A spokesman at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command headquarters in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti gas tanker Gas Princess, escorted by the missile frigate Fahrion, had passed through the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> `` without incident.'' Since the Stars and Stripes was first run up the mast of the renamed supertanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> on July 21, 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has sailed 42,000 miles, nearly equivalent to twice around the equator, protecting 11 `` reflagged'' Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attack in the gulf. For <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, `` Operation Earnest Will'' has guaranteed safe transit for millions of tons of oil products that otherwise might not have reached customers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. For the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, it has meant a grueling test of ships, sailors and technology in a twilight war where threats range from armed speedboats and underwater mines to fast-moving aircraft and dangerously deceptive signals on a radar screen. The escort operation got off to a shaky start when the 401,382-ton <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> hit a mine on the first northbound convoy. It is now semi-retired. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION>, based in the gulf since 1948, grew swiftly from about four ships to the present level, with ten more including an aircraft carrier in a support role in the Arabian Sea. `` A year ago nobody would have predicted we'd have 16 or 17 ships, helicopter carriers, minesweepers, or a lot of other stuff in the gulf,'' an officer said recently. Neither could it be known that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would sink or damage six Iranian vessels in a one-day missile war, or that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruiser would on July 3 shoot down an Iranian jetliner, killing 290 people. The Pentagon said the cruiser mistook the jetliner for an F-14 fighter jet. The incident is still being investigated. A second Kuwaiti tanker was knocked out of service for five months by an Iranian missile attack on <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s main oil terminal, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have had at least three other significant clashes with Iranian craft. About 100 commercial vessels were attacked in the past year, many while sailing to or from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> regards as <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ally in the war. But no U.S-flagged tanker has been molested during a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> convoy. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said its reflagging policy reflects a long-standing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to freedom of navigation and would blunt <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s effort to expand its influence in the oil-rich region. It has opposed a Soviet-backed proposal for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force to replace the seven foreign navies that together have about 30 warships in the gulf. Congressional opponents assailed the reflagging policy as ill-defined and risky, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> backers thwarted repeated efforts to invoke the 1973 War Powers Act, which would require <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal in 90 days unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed otherwise. By rough calculation, the reflagged tankers carry about 20 percent of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s total oil product exports of 600,000 barrels a day. About a third goes to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s retail outlets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the rest to regular customers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats say <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> officials have expressed satsifaction with the convoy operation and that deliveries have been smoother since January, when the convoys were increased in frequency but reduced in size, often to one tanker. The Pentagon estimates the cost of its expanded gulf force at $ 20 million a month. Officials say this has been reduced since <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> began providing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships with free fuel. Nine Americans have been killed in the gulf in the past year, all in helicopter crashes. The missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was nearly sunk by an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> mine, but officers say the crew's ability to save it validated lessons learned in the May, 1987 Stark disaster, when an errant Iraqi missile attack killed 37 crewmen on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate.

 Following are excerpts from the report of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, the independent counsel who investigated Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, and from a written response prepared by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers.

<BYLINE>1985 TAXES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 From <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report: `` The independent counsel has determined from the available evidence that a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated'' federal law `` by willfully filing a materially false tax return and that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated'' federal law `` by willfully failing to pay tax at the time required by law.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he was n't recommending prosecution, in part, because `` Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions were a one-time failure to comply in full with his tax obligation; they were not part of a pattern of disobedience to the tax laws.'' `` Based on the independent counsel's careful review of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s tax returns from 1981 through 1986, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> appears in all other respects to have complied with his tax obligations. There is certainly no rule of law, nor should there be, that excuses an isolated violation of the tax laws. However, the absence of a pattern of noncompliance is a factor that weighs heavily in the taxpayer's favor in the determination whether criminal penalties ... are the preferred remedy for offenses involving one item, or one closely related group of items, on one year's tax returns.'' From the response of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers: `` In an effort to justify the cost of such Herculean labors, Mr. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s staff ultimately seized on two matters that are said to have been discovered in the course of the investigation, and has, with regard to both, issued grossly unjust pronouncements. Mr. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> asserts that there were ` probably' violations of a conflict-of-interest law in the attorney general's conduct with respect t certain telecommunications matters in 1985-1986 and ` probably' violations of criminal tax laws in the October 1986 filing of his personal tax return for 1985. As to each of these matters, for a host of reasons, Mr. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concludes that ` prosecution is not warranted.' `` We agree, of course, that prosecution ` is not warranted' as to either of these two episodes. But the reason is more fudnamental than Mr. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s extended discussion warrants. There is no basis for prosecution because any responsible prosecutor would recognize promptly that there was no criminal violation in either event.''

 From the McKay report: `` During the period investigated by the independent counsel, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> preformed several official acts that benefited Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. These included acts that assisted <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and acts in furtherance of the <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> pipeline project.'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s official acts that benefited Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> began with his actions that assisted <ORGANIZATION> Welbilt </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- when he was counselor to the president. In 1981 and 1982, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> facilitated <ORGANIZATION> Welbilt </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to obtain a contract to manufacture small engines for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` In 1985, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> took actions that substantially assisted Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and others in connection with the proposed <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION> pipeline project.'' But he concluded that `` The independent counsel has determined that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> committed any such offense'' under bribery and anti-gratuity laws. The report notes <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> admitted helping <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, the firm he represented. But it adds `` there is no substantial evidence that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was motivated to take his actions by any consideration other than his friendship for Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. The evidence does not establish that he was even aware at that time of the nature or extent of Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s prospective financial interest in the success of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>.'' From the response of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers: `` Any sturdy soul who undertakes the arduous task of reading the entire report will see that it expressly vindicates Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on the allegations that initially produced the reference to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> _ i.e., charges relating to the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The report similarly exonerates Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on all the publicized allegations concerning the investment of his family funds with <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, on all questions relating to whether <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> ever provided unlawful benefits or gratuities to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, on all questions relating to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s financial disclosure reports, and on the matter of Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s employment with the Multiple Sclerosis society.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s cooperation if not his outright endorsement Monday as the 40th Democratic National Convention opened with a rousing keynote call to end eight years of Republican rule and `` get on with the future.'' `` This election is a contest between those who are satisfied with what they have and those who know we can do better,'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> told a prime-time audience as she kicked off the Democrats' four-day campaign rally for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and ticketmate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Nothing's wrong with you, that you ca n't fix in November,'' she said to roars of approval. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would `` unify this country and get on with the future,'' said the woman with the white hair and the salty Southern accent. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, she said in scorning the Republican opposition, `` Poor <PERSON> George </PERSON> ... he ca n't help it, he was born with a silver foot in his mouth,'' she said scornfully of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> watched the show on television in his hotel suite a few blocks away from the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> hall where the delegates gathered to do his bidding. His night comes Wednesday, when the nomination is sealed, and again Thursday, when he accepts the party's prize. The delegates convened a few hours after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met privately for more than two hours and emerged to say they had smoothed over the disagreements that marred the pre-convention week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is expected to campaign for the ticket this fall, and his supporters will receive greater standing in the party as part of the accords. `` We did not come here for fireworks. We came here for noble works,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Party officials said that as a result of the unity pact with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his supporters would receive close to half the 25 at-large slts on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as well as the resources to campaign on behalf of the ticket this fall. Unity was the official theme of the week. But network prime time was n't five minutes old before the lingering tensions of the primary campaign surfaced. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s delegates shouted rhythmically as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> began watching. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' the governor's majority delegates shouted back across the hall. Some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates said even though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were trying to make peace, they were ready to wage war off the convention floor, and their repeated chants were intended to be a message. `` We are trying to show we still support <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and also show the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> it should include us more in the power structure,'' said delegate <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> took the stage after humorist <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> opened the televised program by leading a group of elementary school students in a warbling rendition of the national anthem. `` In the key of G, the people's key,'' he said with practiced wry wit. Her first ovation, and it was a big one, came after <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> ticked off a litany of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration figures who proved to be unpopular with the Democrats. `` I want to announce to this nation that in a little more than 100 days, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorsuch </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush-era </PERSON> will be over,'' she said to sustained applause. She said, `` For eight straight years <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't displayed the slightest interest in anything we care about and now that he's after a job he ca n't get appointed to, he's like <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> discovering <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ he's found child care, he's found education. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> telephoned Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> at the podium after her speech to offer congratulations. `` What am I going to say on Thursday? You said it all,'' spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> quoted him as telling the Texan. Party sources reported a gentleman's agreement on platform disputes. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> agreed to withdraw 10 of 13 minority planks, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will ask his delegates to vote down his rival's call for higher taxes on the wealthy and no first use of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland will be debated, and is expected to be withdrawn without a vote, the sources said. The convention opened as a new poll pointed to a close contest against the Republicans. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> survey found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drawing 46 percent support to 45 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nationwide. The network said the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus five points. Only a fraction of the delegates were in their chairs when the opening gavel fell, but the floor began to approach gridlock as the parade of speakers went by. `` We're going to look good on television,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the convention chairman, said as delegates danced to a video presentation by entertainer <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON> _ and that was precisely what the party's image-makers had in mind. The convention cornerstone was laid at the end of the evening by former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who urged the delegates to capture the party's most elusive value: `` Unity, one more time, unity,'' he exhorted. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, beaten but unbowed after a gallant primary campaign, set a conciliatory tone in remarks to his delegates and said he was looking forward to helping the nominee `` win in November.'' `` God gave this gentleman a gift and we're going to use it,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would have his name entered into nomination for president on Wednesday night, but added he had no plans to contest <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for vice president, and would give `` no encouragement'' to others who might. The accords of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> provided an upbeat curtain-raiser for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' convention. Party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> praised all those who lost out to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ or almost all. There was no mention of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the long ago front-runner who twice entered the race and twice departed. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was in the convention city in the role of newspaper columnist and television commentator. Opening night showcased some Democrats little known on network television and some who were instantly recognizable. `` My name is <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and I am not running for president. Did you hear that <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' said the former president in a retort that served at once as a revised version of his 1976 campaign slogan and a jab at Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who likes to call <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION> Jimmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> _ and does n't mean it as a compliment. Carter no doubt liked the convention's initial results _ acceptance of delegate credentials without a challenge for the first time in a quarter-century. In her keynote address, Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> sounded the call for change that lies at the heart of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' drive to reclaim the White House for the Democrats. In a speech scripted for precisely 33 minutes, Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and _ lavishly _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and heaped scorn on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts and our minds and stir our very souls,'' she said. `` In contrast,'' she said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for eight straight years `` has pretended to us that he can not hear our questions over the helicopter noise.''

<HEAD>Rare Dolphins Said To Be Doomed Without Fast Help</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dolphin is rarer than the panda but also less famous and less cuddly and that means it may be doomed, says visiting American dolphin trainer <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Barry </PERSON>. The huggable, black-and-white visage of a panda looking out from World Wildlife Fund advertisements around the world has helped raise thousands of dollars to save the fewer than 1,000 pandas left in Chinese forests. But there are no international fund-raising efforts to save the 200 to 300 squinty-eyed, bat-nosed river dolphins. They are dying out as their only native home, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, becomes increasingly congested and polluted. That's where <PERSON> O'Barry </PERSON> comes in. The trainer of the world's most famous dolphin, Flipper, who starred in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television series in the 1960s, <PERSON> O'Barry </PERSON> met last week with Chinese dolphin experts in the central city of <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>. Now he is heading back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to try to launch an emergency campaign to save the dying dolphins. `` They're beautiful. They're bright and very friendly,'' he said in a telephone interview. But without quick action, he said, `` I'm afraid these dolphins may be doomed. <PERSON> O'Barry </PERSON>'s Chinese colleagues were more optimistic, but agreed speedy action is needed. `` The number of dolphins has reached a critical level,'' said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Renjun </PERSON>, an associate professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Wuhan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydrobiology </ORGANIZATION>. `` The dolphins can be protected,'' he said, but only with hard work and thousands of dollars that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> lacks. The <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dolphins are relatives of the common dolphin found worldwide. Like the common dolphin, they grow to more than seven feet and have a dorsal fin. Their snouts are narrower, `` like a small baseball bat,'' <PERSON> O'Barry </PERSON> said, and their skin is whiter. Both kinds rely mainly on sonar to find food and navigate _ and this is part of the river dolphins' problem. The <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, long a commercial thoroughfare, has become jammed in recent decades with boats whose engine roars confuse the dolphins' sonar. Scientists think the hum of propellers often lures dolphins to their death. Commercial fishing is depleting their food source, and many dolphins get caught in fishermen's hooks. Industrial pollution sickens those who survive. Only two exist in captivity, in a cement tank at the <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> institute. There, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> and about two dozen other researchers are trying to learn more about river dolphins, especially how to breed them. No river dolphin has ever been born in captivity. The team is trying to collect sperm from its 9-year-old male dolphin to artificially inseminate a 4-year-old female <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said is still two or three years from sexual maturity. <PERSON> O'Barry </PERSON> was skeptical about the effort. He said he watched the sperm-collecting efforts `` and they're not getting anywhere.'' What's more, he said, the concrete tank is not conducive to dolphin romance: `` Their sonar bounces off the walls and that's alien to them ... and they're not used to swimming in circles. <PERSON> O'Barry </PERSON> and the Chinese agree on the need to set up a sanctuary along the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> where the dolphins can live naturally but with special protections from fishermen and traffic. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said the institute has located a potential site upstream from <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> where many river dolphins congregate naturally. The project will cost as much as $ 81,000, but so far the institute has no money. Another dolphin expert, Dr. <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiya </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Nanjing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, has separately started building a large holding pond for dolphins in the channel between two <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> islands futher downstream in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> O'Barry </PERSON> was enthusiastic about both plans, and said he will ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that do business in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to help underwrite them. He also hopes to use his old <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> connections to organize a televised fundraiser for the dolphins. `` I think this is the last chance.''

 Here at a glance are key developments Monday regarding the investigation of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKAY </PERSON>'S CONCLUSION: Finishing a 14-month investigation, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> issued a report saying <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably broke two tax laws and twice violated a criminal conflict-of-interest statute. However, he told a news conference that `` I have decided that we will not prosecute'' _ a decision `` based on prosecutorial discretion.'' <PERSON> MEESE </PERSON>'S RESPONSE: <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declared that he was outraged and appalled by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s findings, saying that if <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers had issued such a document `` they'd be fired.'' Decrying `` the tarnishing of our system of justice,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> had `` violated every principle of fairness and decency.'' TAXES: <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said in his report that `` A trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated'' a section of the Internal Revenue Code by filing `` a materially false tax return.'' He said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his wife failed to report a net capital gain of $ 20,706 on the sale of $ 54,581 in securities in 1985. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably also violated a section of the Internal Revenue Code for `` willfully failing to pay tax at the time required by law.'' CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST: According to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably violated the conflict-of-interest law in connection with his holdings of $ 14,000 in regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone stock. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> owned the stock in 1985 and 1986, when he set in motion a review process that led to a reversal of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy on the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also found that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> participated in discussions of proposed legislation to shift regulatory responsibility for the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T from a federal court and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. CONGRESSIONAL REACTION: Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It appears from the special counsel's report the attorney general did not exercise good judgment in a number of instances. The attorney general has announced his pending resignation and I hope ... this report finally puts this matter to rest.'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that investigated <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, said of the McKay report: `` The findings I believe are devastating to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, to his claim that he has been ethical How anyone other than <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> could claim that this report vindicates him is beyond me.''

 Natural disasters killed 529 people and caused $ 540 million in damage in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the first half of this year, an official newspaper reported today. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily, quoting a <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, said floods, drought, landslides and cold spells also injured 11,588 people, destroyed 470,000 homes and affected 64 million of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1.07 billion people Disasters also damaged $ 2.4 million homes and killed 90,000 horses and oxen, it said. Most the deaths and injuries were caused by floods that ravaged large areas of southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> last month, washing away at least $ 1.1 billion pounds of grain. The report said 65.8 million acres of land have been affected by drought, which has dried up crops in 18 provinces in central, southern and western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Another 24.7 million acres has been hit by floods. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has about 296 million acres of arable land. The daily said the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had allocated $ 130 million in disaster relief. It did not give comparative figures for casualties and damage in 1987. In 1986, natural disasters claimed 5,381 lives, injured 40,396 and destroyed 2 million homes. The government that year spent $ 384 million to help disaster victims.

All 10 dancers were splendid. <PERSON> Ronda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nychka </PERSON> has an enticing solo in the first scene, `` The Prostitute and the Soldier,'' which ends with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Alleyne </PERSON> as the soldier walking away without looking back. He returns for `` The Soldier and the Parlormaid,'' an expansive, exuberant duet with <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasco </PERSON>. He struts away from that encounter. And so it goes, as we see the narcissistic Young Gentleman, the Young Wife, the Husband, the Sweet Young Thing and so on. The final scene has the Count -LRB- <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustyn </PERSON> -RRB-, after a duet of sophisticated decadence with the Actress, encountering the prostitute from the first scene. <PERSON> Tetley </PERSON> then runs his 10 scenes through again on fast-forward _ a few steps from each. `` La Ronde'' would be stronger without that. And he errs somewhat on the side of subtlety. The differences between scenes should not be as broad as burlesque, but sometimes the differences <PERSON> Tetley </PERSON> draws are so subtle that contrast is lacking. `` Blue Snake,'' choreographed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Desrosiers </PERSON>, seems overly influenced by performance art. Its most striking feature is its sets, with weird costumes coming in second. It is set in a jungle, with modern music by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. Dancers dressed as zebras in abstract black and white leotards cavort and undulate. Monkeys run about to strains of jazz. The face of a giant appears; his arms move in from the side walls, his hands gathering up monkeys and stuffing them through his open mouth. There is drumming, eerie music, people in black with tall dancecaps, three women in blue with gold quills down their spines, people with square pieces of cloth fastened to head, ankle and wrists so they look like flying kites, and people wearing gyroscopes on their heads. It ends with a long snake flying through the air. It's very visual, which must intrigue some audiences. We'd rather see a ballet

 A smoky fire erupted Monday night at the downtown <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building, burning offices on two upper floors of the 38-story tower before it was extinguished. At least two workers in the building escaped safely after the fire broke out about 8:20 p.m. No injuries were reported, said Battalion Chief <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Defeo </PERSON>. On May 4, the worst high-rise fire in the city's history killed one man and injured 40 people at the nearby First Interstate bank building. `` There were some lessons learned in the First Interstate fire,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, who told reporters that firefighters quickly raced up 34 floors to get to the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> fire before it could rage out of control. In the First Interstate blaze, firefighters had had difficulty reaching the flames. Monday's fire was declared extinguished shortly after 9 p.m., said fire spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>. About 75 firefighters were at the scene. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said he was working on the 35th floor when the fire broke out. `` I was in our law library doing some research, and I felt two explosions which I thought was an earthquake,'' he said. `` When I realized it was n't an earthquake, I went back to my desk and the fire alarm went off.'' `` I went and found a co-worker. We looked out one of the windows and saw flames coming up, and we got the heck out of there.'' The fire burned two offices on the 34th floor and 1 -LCB- offices on the 35th floor, said <PERSON> Defeo </PERSON>, adding, `` This was nowhere near the Interstate fire. We got it in time.'' Before the fire was controlled, a television news helicopter circled the tower and spotted flames coming from an upper-story office and thick smoke coming from other windows. The <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower is located within blocks of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building. A sprinkler system was being installed at the First Interstate building, but was not yet operating on the night the fire devastated the upper floors of the state's tallest skyscraper. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Handy </PERSON>, a 24-year-old maintenance worker, died after he became trapped in an elevator. Several people were trapped inside the smoke-filled building for hours as firefighters worked to rescue them. The <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building was equipped with sprinklers in the basement and on the 30th floor, according to Fire Department records. It was built before the 1974 city ordinance requiring sprinklers in high-rises.

 With enough cameras present to cover every conceivable angle of the Democratic National Convention, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> seemed as obsolete as the flash bulb. But there he was, pencils in hand, sketching the scene on his artist's tablet, recording the proceedings for time, rather than for the moment. `` I do this because an artist sees differently,'' <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. `` I see what all these cameras ca n't. I see around the corners. What I do is not just a snapshot. It's a statement, and the camera usually does n't make a statement.'' <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, has been lending his perspective to the political scene for three decades now. His work is being shown at the CNN Center adjacent to the Omni during the convention. While the convention buzzed around him, <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> deliberately outlined a picture, looking for nuances and special characteristics of this convention. He placed a computer terminal in the foreground, symbolizing the equipment used to count each state's votes `` I try to bring an element of humor to it,'' <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. `` This is a TV show and I make sure I show TV some way.''

Even though a plethora of fancy eateries surround the convention area, <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON>'s Kitchen has served a steady stream of customers. She's been going through a 10-pound crate of okra a day, and at least 30 pounds of chicken.

 Forget all the pomp and preparation, the careful creation of convention images for national consumption. For the raw guts of politics, check the podium schedule. From lowly House challengers to sitting governors, politicians are lobbying fiercely for a moment or two in the spotlight at the Democratic National Convention. The evolving schedule provides clear-cut evidence of the pressure, the winners and the losers. For instance, consider this year's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. On the schedule issued Saturday, they were allotted 10 minutes tonight for introductions. In a revision released Monday, the contenders were up to 19 minutes and brief remarks. True, they were scheduled for 4:50 p.m. _ but any exposure is good exposure for challengers fighting for recognition from the home folks who read the local newspaper and watch local TV. `` Podium time is a good boost for these candidates. They'll certainly be covered in their print outlets,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The success of her group sparked a competitive drive at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are co-equal branches of government,'' explained committee chairman <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, D-Ark. His tongue was in his cheek, but he made his point. The revised schedule showed Wednesday proceedings starting 39 minutes earlier than initially planned. More than half an hour was devoted to the House candidates. The House segment on the updated schedule was followed by an all-new governors' segment, as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> weighed in. The leaders of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> secured four or five minutes apiece _ a princely chunk in the fast-moving new world of abridged television coverage. `` People have been astonishingly cooperative about time,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've been able to persuade them that four minutes on the podium constitutes a major address.'' Other late additions to the schedule included introductions of others who ran for president, all of them except Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., who is not here, and former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who is here as a newspaper columnist and television commentator The new schedule set aside time for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, for introducing <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, and even for introducing someone identified as `` the Young Delegate.'' It appeared that <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the presidential nominee in 1984, was one of the casualties of the revised schedule. Designated to be introduced by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the initial program, he was nowhere to be found on the revision. `` You caught what must be either a typo or a lapse in the synapses of the press secretary,'' said <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was indeed introduced, at about 8:30 Monday night _ a half hour before network coverage began. Asked the meaning of this, <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> replied, `` Prime time was 8 to 11 last time I checked.'' There were some true casualties, or heroes, forced to sacrifice their precious podium time to the demands of the modern convention. Everyone presenting a section of the platform lost a minute; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., each lost four <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finance chairman widely considered a miracle worker, dropped from four minutes to two. And a videotape of praise for <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who calls the roll, got slashed from six minutes to three. The time pressure is such that <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> would n't even consider a reporter's question about the possibility of roll call rather than voice votes on platform amendments. `` I would n't want to speculate,'' he said, `` on anything that would keep the clocks from running on time.''

 Deep bitterness smolders among many of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s black delegates over what they see as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' `` slap in the face'' of their candidate and they say whether it hurts <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in November will be settled by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Even after the breakfast accord between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. speaks for many when he says: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not attractive, but I do n't think we can say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at any price.'' State Sen. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, echoes <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> _ and then some: `` At some particular time, dignity becomes more important than any election,'' he says. `` I'll give up anything for dignity, including life.'' But political activist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, draws the line at voting Republican. `` There's not a Democrat here who wants to see <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> elected,'' he says. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has as much obligation to get the Democratic ticket elected as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does.'' On the floor of the Democratic convention Monday night, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates chanted `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'' and said they were trying to send a message. `` I think we are trying to show we still support <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and also show the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> it should include us more in the power structure,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Associated Press reporters interviewed a sampling of black <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates on the potential November fallout from what many blacks call the insulting way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> treated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in picking a Southern moderate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, as running mate at the very time <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had started campaigning for the job _ and then failing to tell <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of that decision. Arthur Eve of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, deputy majority leader of the lower house in the state legislature, says his fellow black <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> delegates are `` outraged'' over a `` snub'' of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that was `` very deliberate and very planned.'' <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> `` Toby'' <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, a black legislator from <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, calls it `` a slap in the face,'' adding: `` You do n't have some underling contact Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>; you do it yourself.'' Dissents <PERSON> Cederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>: `` I do n't feel insulted and I do n't think <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was insulted. Nonetheless, he says: `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs to make an apology.'' Some black <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates say <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> retains enormous power because the signals he sends will decide whether blacks will vote in massive numbers for the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Painter <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 71, from <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, says he'll follow <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s cues `` Whatever way he goes, I'm with him 100 percent,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> says. Chimes in <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a state senator: `` Most of the delegates I know will stick with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> right down the line, wherever it takes us.'' `` A strong endorsement -LRB- of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> -RRB- would get me to support him strongly, but it has to come to that,'' says <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Adds <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Haywood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Camilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>: `` If he comes out enthusiastically for the ticket, then black voters will support it. But if he's lackadaisical, they will interpret it as meaning that it does n't matter if they vote in November or not.'' <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brace </LOCATION>, a black alderman from <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, says the way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> handled <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was an insult to `` black people in general,'' but he feels the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces will return to the fold. `` We'll win in November and we'll win with the black vote,'' he predicts. The interviews yield these additional impressions: _ Some see a Machiavellian duplicity in the way <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> let word slip out before notifying <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` He did it deliberately,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, relaxing during a ride on an antique railroad. `` He was trying to appeal to a certain segment of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters who would like that kind of thing. He was trying to ... say that he was n't going to be dictated to by the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters.'' Adds <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, 35, a community organizer from Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>: `` By choosing <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a statement to the conservative wing of the party.'' _ But some, like <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, pay grudging respect to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' pragmatism <PERSON> Rawlings </PERSON> says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has a tough balancing act to maintain.'' and adds that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would not want to leave the convention `` with the weight of a potential Democratic loss on his shoulders.'' _ Some black delegates say the incident displayed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' remoteness from black `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has to be more sensitive to the needs and concerns of black constituents,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.

 There's more than one way to sell a donkey. You can sling an elephant gun over his shoulder, name him `` Dembo'' and put him on a T-shirt. You can put him on a beer mug or a key chain, or show him kicking an elephant into the next county on the side of a coffee cup.

How are they selling? `` I do n't have any,'' he admitted. `` I saw the lady wearing one and I wanted her to stop and look at this other stuff.'' `` I've got <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> soda pop,'' shouted a vendor standing over an ice-filled cooler.

<HEAD>Heat, Drought Take Toll On Vegetable Yields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commercial vegetable farmers have boosted acreages from a year ago, but heat and drought are taking a toll of some of the crop yields, including peas grown for freezing and canning, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. Consumer food prices overall are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, with about 1 percentage point of the increase attributed to the drought. In 1989, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials say, the current drought losses may force up food prices an additional 2 percentage points, perhaps making a total increase of around 6 percent. Prospective acreage for seven fresh market vegetables was estimated at 272,100 acres, down fractionally from 272,790 a year ago, the report said Monday. Carrots and sweet corn declined, while other crops increased. Those included broccoli, cauliflower, celery, lettuce and tomatoes. The total for five major vegetables for processing was 1.35 million acres under contract to processors, a 2 percent increase from 1987. Increases were reported for snap beans, cucumbers for pickles and tomatoes, but there are fewer acres of sweet corn and green peas. Drought and heat have stressed a number of the crops that have not been irrigated, the report said. For example, in the category of sweet corn for fresh market sale, the report said that drought and heat have hurt the crop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, however, sweet corn `` has made good progress'' after being `` slowed somewhat by unseasonably cool weather.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the tomato crop declined due to drought, and `` yields will be affected severely if the dry weather continues.'' Looking at processing vegetables _ the canned and frozen kind that consumer will see at stores next winter _ the report said hot, dry weather has hurt yields of cucumbers used for making pickles and `` there is increased interest this year in fall planted cucumbers'' for processing. `` Production of green peas for processing is down 32 percent from last year, based on reports from processors,'' the report said. `` Hot, dry weather has reduced the crop expectation to 299,000 tons, compared with 437,000 tons last year and nearly 415,000 tons the year before.'' Drought in the northcentral states has cut the pea crop drastically, the report said. `` Minnesota yields dropped 45 percent as heat during bloom and filling devastated the crop,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> processors report yields at half last year's level. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states held good moisture supplies during the spring and are harvesting generally better -LRB- pea -RRB- crops than last year.'' The government's <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drought </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said last week in a report to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` fruits and vegetables and many other crops will be largely unaffected, even though production may be down in some areas such as the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> states.'' It added: `` These crops are produced over wide areas in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and are often irrigated. The sugar beet crop is expected to be down modestly while supplies of sweet corn, green beans, carrots, beets and tart cherries will also be smaller.''

 Sometimes old research, like yesteryear's fashions, makes a comeback, or at least is done up in new packages, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Back in the 1960s, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> peanut researcher <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pominski </PERSON> and others developed and patented a chemical-free process that removes about half the fat from raw peanuts, which then can be roasted and eaten as a snack food with about a third fewer calories than regular peanuts. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that the patent expired in 1983, but renewed health interest `` has helped bring new interest to the research.''

After that, the raw peanuts are soaked in hot water and then roasted for five minutes. `` Regular roasted peanuts will crumble if you squeeze them, but raw peanuts that are squeezed and then roasted do n't. They regain their shape,'' says <PERSON> Pominski </PERSON>. `` We like to say that raw peanuts have a memory.'' The agency said the lower-fat peanuts are sold by <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> under the `` Weight Watchers'' label.

<HEAD>Democrats Show Unity With Quick Adoption of Rules, Credentials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Democrats pointed to the quick adoption of major rule changes and the seating of more than 4,000 delegates without a fight as a sign to the nation of their commitment to party unity and hopes for victory in November. `` We decided to go down the road of cooperation and it leads to victory in 1988,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., told delegates on Monday at the start of the 48th Democratic National Convention Rules and credentials, constant points of contention for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, were resolved weeks before the convention and adopted without a single floor fight or nay vote shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> gaveled the gathering to order. The speedy adoption _ within 45 minutes _ broke a 25-year Democratic record of fighting. `` We are here to unite tonight,'' said <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvis </PERSON>, speaker of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> House and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Credentials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` I give you a report and there will be no minority report filed. Every single one has been unanimously approved of. Every single debate has been resolved.'' Negotiators for nominee-to-be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> reached agreements last month and the rules and credentials committees ratified the results to ensure a unified convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had enough delegates to win the nomination plus a 600-delegate cushion that allowed him to concede to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s demands for added delegate representation in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> `` Everybody had to swallow a little to win big,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Colo </LOCATION>., who served on the Credentials Committee `` We had 24 disagreements and we resolved every single one of those disagreements before we had a formal meeting,'' <PERSON> Irvis </PERSON> told the convention. `` We met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, without a single problem to resolve.'' And when the delegates responded with unanimous ayes to the credentials report, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> noted that it was `` the first sign of unanimity and unity.'' On the issue of rules, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agreed to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for a change in the delegate selection process for 1992 to make it more closely conform to the popular vote expressed at the primaries and caucuses. The new rules will reduce the number of `` super delegates'' _ elected or party leaders _ from 643 to 394, or 15 percent of the delegate total to about 10 percent. Super delegates are not bound by the results of their state contests. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> contended that his super delegate support, which was about one-tenth that of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, did not reflect the popular vote backing he received in some states. The rules also ban direct-election and `` bonus'' primaries, which had the effect of awarding delegates on a `` winner-take-more'' basis. In states such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, those systems enabled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to amass the delegates needed to clinch the nomination on the last day of the primary season. `` We worked out our differences in a spirit of compromises,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vick </PERSON>, vice chairman from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and head of the Rules Committee. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, mayor of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and representative of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces, said this year `` we worked together ... for a winning team.'' As he left the podium, Ms. <PERSON> Vick </PERSON> said, `` Thank you, Governor <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>,'' a reference to one of the other rule changes. The party will recognize the mayor of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, as a governor in the delegate selection process. The only requirement is that he be a Democrat.

<HEAD>Foreign Visitors Take In American Political System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreigners on hand for the Democratic National Convention are getting a rare look at politics American style and a sneak preview of what kind of foreign policy a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration might bring. `` It's fantastic to see the people from all these states ... it is very, very impressive,'' <PERSON> Molefi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pholo </PERSON>, an official from tiny <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, said Monday. Less impressive were temperatures that soared high into the 90s each day. `` Outside is utter hell,'' he said. `` Hot and humid _ We do n't have that in <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>,'' he said. Pholo is one of more than 300 foreigners from nearly 100 countries to visit the convention as guests of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a government-funded organization affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Money for the trip was raised privately, however. `` It is a rare opportunity for a Chinese to see your system,'' said <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hongqian </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Like others in this city for the hoopla, the foreigners were disappointed they were unable to visit the convention floor because space was so tight. Instead, most watched the proceedings on television. Nonetheless, they managed to get caught up in the excitement of the moment. `` There is an air of confidence -LRB- among the Democrats -RRB- that was noticeably absent at the last two conventions,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a Conservative member of the British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Blairgowrie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a fan of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said 1988 is his fourth Democratic convention. Even so, he predicted Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would win the election. `` They still have problems,'' he said of the Democrats. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, who is retiring as head of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed. `` I am impressed compared to four years ago,'' he said. `` They have gotten their act together.'' Steel was also impressed with the `` zap behind <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign. The issues that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> addresses are legitimate, he said. <PERSON> Raquel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, the wife of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, had the same impression. `` It seems like we have common problems,'' she said. `` Child-care problems, housing problems, health problems.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> acknowledged that democracy as an institution is not as healthy in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Generally, the international guests were eager to talk about the pros and cons of the democratic process, but <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON> of the international department of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was close-lipped. `` I'm sorry, I really ca n't talk with reporters,'' he said. <PERSON> Pholo </PERSON> said he was a less than impartial observer because of concern about Democrats' supporting a platform that calls for tough economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Pholo, principal secretary to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>'s cabinet, said his country is `` totally engulfed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' so sanctions against the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> regime would `` have a very deleterious effect on us.'' <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>, the institute's president, said the group's aim was to give leaders from abroad `` an in-depth exposure to the political system,'' and allow them a preview of what a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> foreign policy might look like. Human rights would play a much larger role in policy if <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins in November, he said. The foreign guests have received briefings from well-known Democrats like former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, the institute's chairman, and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., and toured <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s landmarks, particularly those connected with the civil rights movement They've also been wined and dined; one party for Africans and Frenchmen was hosted by businessman <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempelsman </PERSON>, a some-time escort of <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> with mining interests in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>.

 For Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, it was a good opening day's work at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> _ a `` no deal'' deal with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> coped with his only major convention problem without yielding on points his Democratic ticket can not afford to concede, and without the sort of confrontation that could have alienated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s largely black constituency. Indeed, his <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> summit meeting may have solved a problem for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, too, by providing the defeated presidential candidate with a graceful exit after his certain loss in the roll call that will nominate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday night. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> came away from a session that lasted nearly three hours on Monday saying that he intends to work for the ticket, that he wants to be supportive and complementary. He, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who is getting the vice presidential nomination <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also wanted, appeared together and said all the proper things. They talked about teamwork, a better relationship, understanding, trust _ and very few specifics. `` There is no deal and there is no fine print,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` That is not the way you win elections.'' Not with Republicans watching for concessions that would enable them to say that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had buckled under to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wing. `` Who is going to be the coach?'' asked <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> political adviser and now a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> `` truth squad'' observer in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Is <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> going to call the shots?'' <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> said that would turn off a lot of voters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in advance that he would be calling the Democratic plays. He did on Monday, with gestures and concessions to reassure the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wing. He conceded nothing of major significance. Party sources say the two camps reached an agreement on platform disputes, under which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will withdraw 10 of the 13 minority platform planks that were to be debated tonight. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will ask his delegates to vote down his rival's call for higher taxes on the wealthy and no first use of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland will be debated, and is expected to be withdrawn without a vote, the sources said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s major convention address also is scheduled tonight. There was another gesture in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' telephoned invitation to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to the peace summit before, not after, the challenger's own candidacy has ended. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is n't endorsing the ticket because he still is running against it. He said he's still looking for a miracle, and that when it does n't happen, his campaign will pass over into a new phase. That phase will get financial and staff help from the victors. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will have chartered airplanes for campaign missions in the fall. He got the same thing four years ago from the campaign of former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hinted at a role for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a future Democratic administration, calling him a great leader `` and we hope in January part of the American government.'' But campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said there was no agreement on a role for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or his people in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> transition or administration. He said that would flow from natural evolution in a cooperative, winning campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s camp was promised a bigger role on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but at the bottom, not the top. When 25 at-large members are appointed on Friday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters will get about a dozen seats. But they will not have one of their own installed as chairman or co-chairman to replace or to share authority with chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>. There will apparently be a new, top level voter registration position to be filled by a Jackson ally. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> representatives had agreed in advance to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> demands on another front _ changes in the way Democratic nominating delegates are elected. The Jackson-backed revisions, approved by the convention Monday night without dissent, have the effect of requiring that delegates be awarded more closely in proportion to the popular vote in primary elections. In addition, the rules cut back sharply on the number of convention seats set aside for party leaders and officeholders, and left uncommitted by the primary process. The idea was to create an independent bloc of office-holding delegates. The assumption was that they would align with the candidate most likely to win the general election. The 643 super delegates at this convention are for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 10 to 1. At the next convention there will be 394. `` We negotiated new rules for 1992,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. That makes no practical difference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. If he wins on Nov. 8, he will be up for renomination, and it will be no contest. If he loses, the 1992 field will belong to other candidates. One of them, surely, would be <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The Democratic National Convention opened with a smoking ban, a pledge to stay on time, some homespun politics and a child's view of the presidency. But unity? Not really. Supporters of the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, some wearing buttons reading `` Respect Blackocrats Or Else,'' waged a war of shouts on the floor of the Omni Monday night. They chanted `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, Jesse'' each time their candidate's name was mentioned, and audibly overpowered the refrains of `` Duke, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. The message was n't lost on the majority of delegates for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` They can have their time,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` When the whole thing is over, we'll be demonstrating together,'' predicted <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bielski </PERSON>. `` The party has received their message.'' The party also received a folksy Pledge of Allegiance from radio raconteur and author <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> and a group of first graders, as well as celebrity readings of children's essays on the presidency. If that were n't enough wholesomeness, the party banned smoking in the convention hall, driving smokers out to a hazy arena outer lobby. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Agostinelli </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, businessman was on the floor chomping on an unlit cigar. `` I do n't like it, but what are you going to do? I've been a cigar smoker for 35 years. It's tough,'' he said. <PERSON> Agostinelli </PERSON>, a visitor, not a delegate, said, `` I have n't had it lit since I got out of the car, but three people have come up to me and said, ` Would you mind putting that out?''' The Democrats offered everything from biographical videos of keynote speaker <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and former president <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to music videos of pop star <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamond </PERSON>. There was a brass band, enough celebrities to satisfy `` Entertainment Tonight,'' and plenty of corny provincialism _ like cardboard crab placards for the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> delegation. The opening affair ran a few minutes late, and there were a few awkward moments, like the 90 seconds the podium was empty after <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> was introduced. No matter. `` I feel like I'm on the brink of history,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, Md. `` This party's not used to not having fights,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> delegate.

 The Democrats tailored their convention to network prime time, all right, down to casting a new television star. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' keynote address was the highlight of the opening session of the Democratic National Convention on Monday night. The speech soothed fears, at least for the night, that television coverage of the event was going to be dull as dishwater after <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> patched up their differences Monday morning. The convention even ended virtually on time, running only about 10 minutes over the 11 p.m. EDT scheduled close. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' 30-minute address was down-home, funny and sentimental. It could have been a network sitcom. In fact, with her Southern twang, viewers tuning in for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Designing Women,'' which the speech pre-empted, might not have noticed the difference. Only CBS' <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> got to <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> for an interview after her speech. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said she `` did n't think my eye contact with the camera was all that great,'' but otherwise thought she did all right. Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s ascension to the platform _ this time he got prime-time treatment, unlike 1984 _ was an emotional high point, though his speech was lackluster after <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. Until <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' speech, the name of the game Monday night for the networks was get <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> even went on the air a half-hour earlier than the scheduled 9 p.m. to be first with live interviews of the two principals. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> stuck to its plan to open with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at 9. CBS started with a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> interview taped minutes earlier. Only <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> viewers saw the nice bit of Americana that opened prime-time coverage of the session _ <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> and a group of elementary-school children saying the pledge of allegiance and singing the national anthem. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> went a tad high on the cute-o-meter, though, with cutaways to <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> joining in. Despite a barrage of network interviews throughout the night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> revealed little about the behind-the-scenes bargaining that led to their reconciliation. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was admirably dogged, though. `` Sir, I can not turn this loose,'' he told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` You still have n't told me, you have n't told our viewers what you two agreed to.'' To no avail. Until the Dukakis-Jackson summit meeting and subsequent news conference on Monday, it seemed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s resentment at not being chosen running mate might turn into some newsworthy controversy at the otherwise well-planned convention. `` If it were n't for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, we would n't have anything,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Brit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> had said Sunday. `` Do you have a plane ticket to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>?'' quipped <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> on Monday. Things went smoothly Monday night for network floor reporters who had anticipated the worst in the small, crowded <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arena </ORGANIZATION>, though when <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> remarked that it looked reasonably roomy down there, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON> replied: `` There will be no walkout at this convention. It would take five pounds of axle grease to get anybody out of here.''

 CBS, in contract negotiations with legendary anchor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>, is being careful to make him feel wanted during the convention. During a weekend special, <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> made their first network appearance together since <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> suggested he would have fired Rather for causing the network to go black for six minutes last fall. Despite the tension, Rather was especially cordial, even shaking <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>'s hand and referring to him as `` colleague and mentor.'' On Monday night, <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>'s commentary led off CBS' convention coverage and closed it, though the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> affiliate and probably many others did n't come back for the wrap-up because the coverage cut into local news time. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> also has war horse <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevareid </PERSON> on hand.

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are not the only sought-after interviewees at the convention. There are dozens of local television stations at the convention, and the network anchors have at least a dozen requests each from local affiliates who want the big guy on the local news.

<HEAD>Final Days As Nominee-To-Be: Watching The Convention On TV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> escaped the crowds for a brisk `` power walk'' through a city park, then endured a gantlet of network interviews and technical glitches before settling in to watch the televised version of the convention that will nominate him for president. Awaiting his formal nomination on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> saw the opening night of the Democratic National Convention on a bank of color televisions in his penthouse suite at a hotel just blocks from the convention hall. He tuned in just as the keynote speech by <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> began, and he phoned her immediately afterward. `` What am I going to say on Thursday?'' he told her. `` You said it all.'' With the resolution of campaign tensions between himself and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> apparently out of the way, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was going today to the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Center and gravesite for a tour and speech Accompanying him were the slain civil rights leader's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dukasis </PERSON>' designated running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Following a relaxed schedule, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took top aide <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitropolous </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on Monday afternoon for some exercise _ despite the muggy, 90-degree plus weather. A former jogger who now prefers fast walks, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> carried four-pound weights in each hand and moved his arms vigorously with each step in what he calls a `` power walk'' exercise. They went to the park without the national press entourage that is otherwise ever present when he moves around the city, and they walked for three miles. `` We did n't see a single <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporter in the park,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deadpanned hours later, talking with aides and a reporter as he moved between suites at his hotel. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was joined in his private quarters by the speaker of his state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevarian </PERSON>, and he took a few moments to talk with top state aides back in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> by phone. `` Compared to the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, this is a day at the beach,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also spent time working on his nomination acceptance speech to be delivered Thursday night. He did n't plan to enter the convention hall until that night. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' three-hour meeting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> early in the day produced talk of party unity by both men. The main order of business for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' evening was the series of interviews he conducted with the four network anchors. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> each had their turn, using control rooms set up near where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and aides are staying. Aside from the expected questions about the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> settlement, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> faced some unexpected remarks _ like when <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> related the tale that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was so frugal he once took a piece of hard candy from his mouth before a speech, saved it and resumed enjoying it afterward. Off camera, he later explained that his motive was to avoid a mess: `` I did n't want to leave it there, so I stuck it back in my mouth.'' Before his <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> interview, however, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sat silently while technicians shouted back and forth over multiple audio lines about a sound failure that lasted right up to airtime. `` Why does n't he hear <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>?'' a control-room voice repeated. `` I'm sorry for all that,'' anchor <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said into <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' earpiece seconds before they went on live, his sound line to the governor restored `` I think it's designed to drive us all crazy 30 seconds before air.'' As the show came on, Mitropolous and other aides watched from a next-door bedroom that was converted into a control room. The anchor quoted an unidentified senior aide to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as saying, `` We want a convention that is organized, orderly and short _ just like our candidate.'' Stunned, the assembled aides groaned. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who is 5-foot-8, did n't flinch. `` He can take a punch,'' a producer for a rival network said later.

<HEAD>Carter Regaining Place in Democratic Spotlight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, shunned by his own party after a trying term in the White House that ended in a landslide defeat eight years ago, is edging back toward the spotlight. As his party's only living former president, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> received a warm reception Monday night after being introduced to the Democrats' national convention as `` a great American and a great Democrat.'' But he barely made prime time, for his appearance was the closing act for the opening night of the Democratic National Convention. Twice he dominated party conventions _ in 1976 when he went on to the presidency and four years later when the campaign ended in humiliating defeat. Delegates applauded for two minutes at the beginning and again at the end of a speech in which he warned the Democrats to set aside their propensity for internal battles. `` If I had to give you just one special message tonight,'' he told them, `` I would summarize it in a single word: unity.'' He urged the delegates to `` go forth from this convention united behind out candidates and our ideals.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> could still remember vividly the 1980 Democratic convention when he was nominated for a second term only after a bitter fight with Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. That convention ended with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> circling each other on the podium, the senator trying to avoid a peacemaking embrace with his victorious rival. The memory of the 1980 campaign in which Republican <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> carried 44 states to sweep <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> out of office and help propel the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sent <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> into a political exile during which he rarely appeared at party functions. He spoke on the opening night of the 1984 convention, but his appearance was little noticed in the acclaim given the keynote address that year by Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milledgeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, who was a member of the site selection committee for the 1988 convention, said people would ask when they heard the meeting might be held in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, `` What are you going to do about President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>?'' `` We're going to pull him out and put him on a pedestal and let everyone appreciate him like we appreciate him,'' she said, describing her reply. But the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> peanut farmer who burst from obscurity in 1976 to win the presidency still had to compete with the keynote speaker _ this time <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. And by the time he spoke, many of the seats that were filled for her speech had emptied. Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> reminded delegates of some of <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s finer moments. `` Let us remember him clasping the hands of <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Menahem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>, recalling the Camp David accords that brought peace between <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` He told the truth, he made his country strong,'' added <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>. Republicans ridiculed <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> for an administration during which Americans were held hostage in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and inflation and interest rates hit double digits. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues to push that image of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> years in his campaign, a tactic that the former president derisively noted Monday night. `` I have one announcement to make,'' he said. `` My name is <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and I am not running for president. Did you hear that, <PERSON> George </PERSON>?''

 Democratic keynoter <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> drew laurels _ and laughter _ for a speech that used an easy, homey tone and wicked humor to talk about what the Democrats can do for American families and what the Republicans have not. `` This Republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of a puzzle that ca n't fit together,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state treasurer said in her Monday night speech that departed in style and tone from the traditional stemwinder that opens political conventions. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, whose Democratic keynote address four years ago propelled him to hero status in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' effort `` great,'' adding: `` She lit their fuse tonight.'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who is <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' state treasurer and a 54-year-old divorced mother of four grown children, saved her most pointed quips for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee-to-be. The Omni audience interrupted the speech at least 50 times with applause and laughs. Afterward, delegates said they were taking their favorite <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' lines home with them. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to live for a long, long time with a silver foot in his mouth. That one will stick,'' said delegate <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of Grand Rapids, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The `` silver foot'' line, an instant classic among delegates, was interrupted twice in the midst of it and ended with a roaring response from delighted delegates. `` Poor <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said, grinning broadly. `` He ca n't help it He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was barbecued early and often by the treasurer from the state where he has a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hotel suite that he calls home. `` I am delighted to be here with you this evening because after listening to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> all these years I figured you needed to know what a real <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accent sounds like,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who plans a 1990 race for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> governor, said in an opening line that quickly got the crowd on its feet. Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> was emotional, too. She talked about a woman from <PERSON> Lorena </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who had written her a letter that complained that life has become difficult despite a family income of about $ 50,000. `` I believe people like us have been forgotten in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the mother of three said in her letter. `` Of course you believe you're being forgotten. Because you have been,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said, blaming the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. She excited both major factions at the convention by heaping praise on presidential nominee-to-be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and runner-up <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'' chant rang out after Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> called him `` a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts and minds and stir our very souls.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backers chanted `` <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>,'' when Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said the best traditions of straight-talking Democrats `` live today in <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' And she had warm words for another Texan, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' designated running mate. `` He knows how to bring us together by region, by economics, by example,'' she said of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` And he's already beaten <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a 1970 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Senate race. Delegates from around the nation, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself, called the <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> speech a winner. `` He said he thought it was great,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> said after talking by telephone to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He wanted to know what he could say now because I'd taken all his good lines.'' <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Shores </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, one of many delegates who said they knew little about Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> before Monday, said the speech `` caught our attention and our hearts.'' Delegate <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> said the talk even topped <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s 1984 keynote. `` I love hearing a feminist with a Southern accent,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rockne </PERSON> said. `` I had never heard of her,'' said delegate <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` You can become a star overnight in this ball game.''

<HEAD>Abortions Further Restricted at Military Hospitals</HEAD>

 Doctors at military hospitals will not perform abortions starting Oct. 1 unless the mother's life is in danger. Doctors have been barred since 1979 from performing abortions paid for by the government unless the life of the mother is endangered, but were allowed to perform so-called `` pre-paid abortions'' in `` certain countries in which quality medical care may not be locally available.'' A memo obtained Monday signed by Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for health affairs, changes the policy. It says `` it might suggest insensitivity to the spirit of the congressionally enacted policy of withholding government involvement in the provision of abortions.''

<HEAD>Poll Gives Dukakis Lead Among Hispanic-Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a 58 percent to 32 percent lead over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> among Hispanic voters, according to a poll released by a Spanish-language television network. The survey of 612 likely Hispanic voters, which had a margin of error of 4.7 percentage points, showed the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor held a better than 2-1 margin among Mexican-Americans and Puerto Rican-Americans, <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> said. But the vice president is favored by 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> voters _ a traditionally strong Republican community, the network said. Overall, 10 percent of the Hispanic voters were undecided. The survey was conducted July 1-13, using a combination of door-to-door and telephone interviews, <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> said. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> survey of 458 registered voters conducted Sunday, meanwhile, found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a dead heat among all voters, with 45 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 46 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The survey, with a margin of error of five points, found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> doing better with women than in past surveys and found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> receiving no immediate benefit from the selection of Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as a running mate.

 Here is a transcript of the keynote address as delivered by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> at the Democratic National Convention Monday night. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Buenas noches, mis amigos! I am delighted to be here with you this evening because after listening to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accent sounds like. Twelve years ago, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> woman, made the keynote address to this convention _ and two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But, if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> did everything that <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> did. She just did it backwards and in high heels. I want to announce to this nation that in a little more than 100 days, the Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-St ockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-George <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be over. You know, tonight I feel a little like I did when I played basketball in the eighth grade. I thought I looked real cute in my uniform and then I heard a boy yell from the bleachers, `` Make that basket, bird legs.'' My greatest fear is that same guy is somewhere in the audience tonight and he's going to cut me down to size. Where I grew up there really was n't much tolerance for self-importance, people who put on airs. I was born during the Depression in a little community just outside <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> and I grew up listening to <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> on the radio. Well, it was back then that I came to understand the small truths and hardships that bind neighbors together. Those were real people with real problems. And they had real dreams about getting out of the Depression. I can remember summer nights when we'd put down what we called a Baptist pallet and we listened to the grown-ups talk. I can still hear the sound of the dominoes clicking on the marble slab my daddy found for a tabletop. I can still hear the laughter of the men telling jokes you were n't supposed to hear _ telling about how big that old buck deer was, laughing about mama putting <ORGANIZATION> Clorox </ORGANIZATION> in the well when the frog fell in. They talked about war and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and what this country needed. They talked straight talk. And it came from people living their lives as best they could. And that's what we're going to do tonight. We're going to tell how the cow ate the cabbage. I got a letter last week from a young mother in <LOCATION> Lorena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and I want to read a part of it to you. She writes, `` Our worries go from pay day to pay day ... just like millions of others, and we have two fairly decent incomes. But I worry about how I'm going to pay the rising car insurance and food.

<TEXT>
 `` I pray my kids do n't have a growth spurt from August to December so I do n't have to buy new jeans. We buy clothes at the budget stores and we have them fray, and fade, and stretch in the first wash. `` We ponder and try to figure out how we're going to pay for college, and braces, and tennis shoes We do n't take vacations and we do n't go out go out to eat. `` Please do n't think me ungrateful. We have jobs, and a nice place to live, and we're healthy. `` We're the people you see every day in the grocery store. We obey the laws, we pay our taxes, we fly our flags on holidays. `` And we plod along, trying to make it better for ourselves and our children and our parents. We are n't vocal anymore. I think maybe we're too tired. `` I believe that people like us are forgotten in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Well, of course you believe you're forgotten. Because you have been. This Republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of a puzzle that ca n't fit together. They've tried to put us into compartments and separate us from each other. Their political theory is, `` divide and conquer.'' They've suggested time and time again that what is of interest to one group of Americans is not of interest to anyone else. We've been isolated We've been lumped into that sad phraseology called `` special interests.'' They've told farmers that they were selfish, that they would drive up food prices if they asked the government to intervene on behalf of the family farm, and we watched farms go on the auction block while we bought food from foreign countries. Well, that's wrong They told working mothers it's all their fault that families are falling apart _ because they had to go to work to keep their kids in jeans, tennis shoes and college. And they're wrong. They told American labor they were trying to ruin free enterprise by asking for 60 days notice of plant closings, and they're wrong. And they told the auto industry, and the steel industry, and the timber industry, and the oil industry, companies being threatened by foreign products flooding this country, that you're protectionist if you think the government should enforce our trade laws And they're wrong. When they belittle us for demanding clean air and clean water, for trying to save the oceans or the ozone layer, that's wrong. No wonder we feel isolated. And confused. We want answers and their answer is that something is wrong with you. Well, nothing's wrong with you. Nothing's wrong with you that you ca n't fix in November. We've been told _ we've been told that the interests of the South and the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> are not the same interests as the North and the Northeast. They pit one group against the other. They've divided this country. And in our isolation we think government is n't going to help us, and that we're alone in our feelings. We feel forgotten.

 Well, the fact is that we are not an isolated piece of their puzzle. We are one nation. We are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>! Now, we Democrats believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is still the country of fair play, that we can come out of a small town or a poor neighborhood and have the same chance as anyone else and it does n't matter whether we are black or Hispanic or disabled or a woman We believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a country where small business owners must succeed because they are the bedrock, backbone of our economy. We believe that our kids deserve good day care and public schools. We believe our kids deserve public schools where students can learn, and teachers can teach. We want to believe that our parents will have a good retirement _ and that we will, too. We Democrats believe that Social Security is a pact that can not be broken. We want to believe that we can live out our lives without the terrible fear that an illness is going to bankrupt us and our children. We Democrats believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can overcome any problem, including the dreaded disease called AIDS. We believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is still a country where there is more to life than just a constant struggle for money. And we believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must have leaders who show us that our struggles amount to something and contribute to something larger, leaders who want us to be all that we can be. We want leaders like <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts and open our minds and stir our very souls. And he has taught us that we are as good as our capacity for caring. Caring about the drug problem, caring about crime, caring about education and caring about each other. Now, in contrast, the greatest nation of the free world has had a leader for eight straight years that has pretended that he can not hear our questions over the noise of the helicopter. And we know he does n't want to answer. But we have a lot of questions. And when we get our questions asked, or there's a leak, or an investigation, the only answer we get is, `` I do n't know,'' or `` I forgot.'' But you would n't accept that answer from your children. I would n't. Do n't tell me `` you do n't know'' or `` you forgot.'' We're not going to have the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that we want until we elect leaders who are going to tell the truth. Not most days _ but every day. Leaders who do n't forget what they do n't want to remember. And, for eight straight years <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't displayed the slightest interest in anything we care about. And now that he's after a job that he ca n't get appointed to, he's like <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> discovering <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He's found child care. He's found education Poor <PERSON> George </PERSON>. He ca n't help it _ he was born with a silver foot in his mouth. Well no wonder, no wonder we ca n't figure it out. Because the leadership of this nation is telling us one thing on TV and doing something entirely different.

 They tell us, they tell us that they're fighting a war against terrorists. And then we find that the White House is selling arms to the ayatollah. They tell us that they're fighting a war on drugs, then people come on TV and testify that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> knew they were flying drugs into <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> all along. And they're negotiating with a dictator who is shoveling cocaine into this country like crazy I guess that's their Central American strategy. Now, they tell us that employment rates are great and that they're for equal opportunity, but we know it takes two paychecks to make ends meet today, when it used to take one. And the opportunity they're so proud of is low-wage, dead-end jobs. And there is no major city in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where you can not see homeless men sitting in parking lots holding signs that say, `` I will work for food.'' Now, my friends, we really are at a crucial point in American history. Under this administration, we have devoted our resources to making this country a military colossus, but we've let our economic lines of defense fall into disrepair. The debt of this nation is greater than it has ever been in our history. We fought a world war on less debt than the Republicans have built up in the last eight years. You know, it's kind of like that brother-in-law who drives a flashy new car but he's always borrowing money from you to make the payments. Let's take what they are proudest of, that is their stand on defense. We Democrats are committed to a strong America. And, quite frankly, when our leaders say to us, we need a new weapons system, our inclination is to say, `` Well, they must be right.'' But when we pay billions for planes that wo n't fly, billions for tanks that wo n't fire, and billions for systems that wo n't work, that old dog wo n't hunt. And you do n't have to be from <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> to know that when the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> makes crooks rich and does n't make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong, that it's a bum deal. Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm really glad that our young people missed the Depression, and missed the great big war. But I do regret that they missed the leaders that I knew. Leaders who told us when things were tough, and that we would have to sacrifice, and these difficulties might last awhile. They did n't tell us things were hard for us because we were different, or isolated, or special interests. They brought us together and they gave us a sense of national purpose. They gave us Social Security. And they told us we're setting up a system where we could pay our own money in and when the time came for our retirement, we could take the money out. People in rural areas were told that we deserved to have electric lights, and they were going to harness the energy that was necessary to give us electricity so my grandmama did n't have to carry that old coal oil lamp around.

 And they told us that they were going to guarantee that when we put our money in the bank, that the money was going to be there, and it was going to be insured. They did not lie to us. And I think one of the saving graces of Democrats is that we are candid. We talk straight talk. We tell people what we think. And that tradition, and those values live today in <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> knows that this country is on the edge of a great new era, that we're not afraid of change, that we're for thoughtful, truthful, strong leadership. Behind his calm there's an impatience to unify this country and get on with the future. His instincts are deeply American, they're tough and they're generous And personally, I have to tell you that I have never met a man who had a more remarkable sense about what is really important in life. And then there's my friend and my teacher for many years, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. And I could n't be prouder, both as a Texan and as a Democrat, because <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> understands <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ from the barrio to the boardroom. He knows how to bring us together, by regions _ by economics _ by example. And he's already beaten <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once. So, when it comes right down to it, this election is a contest between those who are satisfied with what they have _ and those who know we can do better. That's what this election is really all about. It's about the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream. Those who want to keep it for the few _ and those of us who know it must be nurtured and passed along. I'm a grandmother now. And I have one nearly perfect granddaughter named <PERSON> Lily </PERSON>. And when I hold that grandbaby, I feel the continuity of life that unites us, that binds generation to generation, that ties us with each other. And sometimes I spread that Baptist pallet out on the floor and <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> and I roll a ball back and forth. And I think of all the families like mine, like the one in <LOCATION> Lorena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, like the ones that nurture children all across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And as I look at Lily, I know that it is within families that we learn both the need to respect individual human dignity and to work together for our common good. Within our families, within our nation, it is the same. As we sit there, I wonder if she'll ever grasp the changes I've seen in my life If she'll ever believe that there was a time when blacks could not drink from public water fountains, when Hispanic children were punished for speaking Spanish in the public schools, and women could n't vote. I think of all the political fights I've fought, and all the compromises I've had to accept as part payment. And I think of all the small victories that have added up to national triumphs. And all the things that never would have happened and all the people who would have been left behind if we had not reasoned, and fought, and won those battles together.

 Here is a transcript of the speech by former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to the Democratic National Convention Monday night. When we left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 7 -LCB- years ago, I invited all my Democratic friends to come to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> to see us. But I never expected that you would all come _ and at the same time. Well, this is a grand gathering of Democrats. But there's going to be an even greater one in January when we all meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to celebrate the inauguration of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as president and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as vice president. Oh, yes, I almost forgot. I have one announcement to make _ which, like a lot of other things this year may come as a bit of a surprise to the incumbent vice president. My name is <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and I am not running for president! Did you hear that <PERSON> George </PERSON>? Well, I have to admit there are some parallels with both of our final candidates. I'm a Southerner, I'm a Baptist, some people even like to say I love to preach, and my political career was made possible by the civil rights movement. That does sound familiar. There have been a lot of comparisons made between <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and myself. But I know one thing for sure. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is also going from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to the White House. Our party has been blessed with good candidates this year. And not just this year. Would n't <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> have made a great president? <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has stirred the soul of our country, he's given hope to millions, and he's healed wounds that have too long divided us one from another. He is an inspired leader, he is destined for further greatness. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, we salute you. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ran a brilliant campaign of substance and respect for the intelligence of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. He'll be a great leader for our country. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> is being compared to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. He is from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. He has chosen a running mate from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. And he's going to defeat an incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deserves that comparison. But he reminds me of other great leaders of our party as well. Like <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, he's an idealist who believes we can be true to our own best selves in a brutal world Like <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, he's a tough fighter. Like <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, he's an innovator with the courage to experiment and the confidence to find solutions. And let's be clear about one thing: We want <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to be elected _ not just so Democrats can take office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but because we know that change is long overdue. We want a federal deficit brought under control. We want a coherent foreign policy. And we want to bring back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> people who are more interested in public service than they are in private gain.

 Each of us pauses on occasion to reassess our own lives: to look at what we have become, the mistakes we've made, and to decide what we would like to be. I think, as a nation, we make this same kind of reassessment when we elect a president. Now is the time to reconsider our opportunities and our challenges _ to make a change _ and to decide what we want for the future. Especially to decide what we want for the future. A democracy is always an unfinished creation. Each generation must rediscover the meaning of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s dream. Tonight I'm thinking not only about the next president, but about our nation's children and how they will live in years to come. <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> and I have six grandchildren. What kind of world will we leave to them and to other young people? In thinking about the past eight years and looking ahead, let's recall the words of a great American president, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> Listen to what he said: `` Governments can err. Presidents do make mistakes; but ... better the occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.'' For the sake of our children, for the sake of our future, we must melt that ice. It's time to reach out for the homeless, to families broken by drug addiction and disease. It's time to clean up those <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> scandals and build a lean, tough, competent military force. It's time to have a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that fights for civil rights. It's time to quit living on credit and expecting our children to pay the bills some day. It's time to tackle the continuing problems of poverty, of a decaying environment, of the bankruptcy of family farms. And it's time to invest in the education and care of our children. Because that's the kind of nation we are. That's the kind of people we are. In some ways, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a big family. A family does not ignore the sickness or pain of any of its children. A family gives all its members help and love. That is the kind of families we have _ and that's the kind of nation we want. And a good family plans for its children's future _ and that means education. Eight years ago, no American student was deprived of a college education because of financial reasons. But now, for many young Americans, these opportunities have been wiped out. Starting in 1989, that is going to change. We Democrats do not fear change. We welcome it. Because change means hope. Change means life. Above all, change means opportunity. And no changes are more profound than those taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The world is fascinated with the news from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made move after move that would have seemed unthinkable a decade ago.

 It is still too early to assess the permanence or sincerity of these changes. We must never forget that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s actions are designed to help his own country, not ours. Certainly the competition between our superpowers will remain. But it can become more peaceful and more constructive. And in that kind of competition, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has all the advantages. We have a free and creative system of government. We are strong economically. Our farm lands are highly productive. We espouse basic human freedoms and democracy. We are a religious people. We are on the cutting edge of technological and scientific progress. Our neighbors are our friends, and not our slaves. Building on these foundations, our next president must regain <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s world leadership as the acknowledged champion of peace, of arms control, of human rights, and of justice. The free world looks to us for leadership, but we can not lead by using military force to impose our will on other people. We can best fight communism in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by joining with other democratic nations to make sure that the Sandinistas and the Contras carry out all the provisions of the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> peace plan _ and that the people of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have freedom from both oppression and war. We have other responsibilities far from home. Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> is not just a weekend retreat; it is a symbol of the courage and determination of two great leaders _ an <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> and an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> _ to make peace. Arabs and Jews still cry out for peace, but without a strong and persistent involvement of the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they will not have peace. Starting in 1989, that will change. It's time to renew our environmental commitments. The greenhouse effect, the destruction of the ozone layer, acid rain are no longer just theoretical possibilities _ they are immediate threats to all of us. Beginning in 1989, a new Democratic president will work other leaders on earth to ensure our children, and to ensure us, a decent planet on which to live. This nation deserves a foreign policy based on the values that unite us as Americans _ a foreign policy that can win the support, for a change, of both political parties. The consequences of unilateral decisions made in the White House bring back to us vivid and unpleasant memories; <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines dying in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>; harbors illegally mined and Contras illegally armed; ransom paid to the ayatollah in weapons; appeasement in the face of apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Starting in 1989, that is also going to change. Ours is the strongest nation on earth _ but sometimes we forget what measures our strength. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is strong when we are for peace instead of belligerence. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is strong when we are the leading defender of human rights. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is strong when we reach out to the suffering. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is strong when we work with other nations to reduce nuclear arsenals and to curtail the world's horrendous trade in deadly weapons. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is strong when we protect the green planet that gives us life. My fellow Democrats, our party is best equipped to meet the challenge of change because we are the party of change. We are the party of diversity. Just look around this hall _ you'll see all the beautiful variety that makes <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong and special and great. Because we are so inclusive, many of the conflicts of American life are fought _ and creatively resolved _ within our ranks. That is our strength. But it is also our danger. That is why, if I had to give you just one special message tonight, I would summarize it in a single word: Unity. One more time. One more time so you wo n't forget: Unity. Let us go forth from this convention united behind our candidates and our ideals _ and with our eyes on the prize. United, united, we Democrats will bring a great future to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Our grandchildren _ and yours _ will be grateful. Thank you. God bless you. Good night. On to victory. Thank you.

 From triple-digit inflation to a crushing $ 104 billion foreign debt, President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> faces a series of challenges that would have made some of his 60 predecessors wince. Horrendous unemployment, a ballooning population and growing discontent with the political party that has run <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> since 1929 further threaten to make <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' inaugural term something less than a picnic in the park. By the time <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> leaves office in six years, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s population is expected to have grown by about 10 million to 91 million, all crammed in an area three times the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Unless he can reverse the trends, that growth will mean more people for fewer jobs. With about half the current population under age 16, it is estimated that by the time <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' term ends, about 1 million young people a year will be looking for work for the first time. A recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> showed that only 350,000 jobs were created last year, a drop from the previous year. Another study, by <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said roughly 28 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s labor force of 47 million people lack steady jobs and 14 percent are jobless _ a total of 42 percent. Inflation, which reached a 159.2 percent annual rate last year, has eroded the average purchasing power of wages by more than half. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> says one of his priorities will be to restore the value of earnings. `` We will have to provide that and also housing, education, health care and other basic services,'' not only to cut deficits but also for the 6 million new jobseekers who will emerge during his administration, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said in a recent interview with the television network <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION>. If foreign debt payments become too burdensome they will be renegotiated or suspended altogether, he added. A survey by the governing party think tank _ the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> _ indicates that gross fixed investment has been dropping by an annual average of nearly 5 percent, with a drop of 12 percent in 1986. For decades, illegal emigration of millions of Mexicans to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acted as an escape valve for the population problem. But a 1987 law in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that fines employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens could shut or narrow the aperture. As budget and planning secretary for five years in outgoing President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>'s administration, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> was associated with belt-tightening and other unpopular measures. Both the governing party's labor wing and its old guard strongly opposed his nomination. So <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is now busy trying to mend fences, especially with <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON>, the 88-year-old leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. The centrist <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, has won every major election since it was founded in 1929, its critics claim it often resorts to ballot fraud. Charges of vote fraud were louder than ever this year as the government delayed release of results until a week after the July 6 balloting, and then said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won with just over 50 percent of the vote _ 20 percent less than previous <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> presidential victories. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s patronage system still goes deep into the country's grass roots, but its power base has been eroding under pressure from growing forces on both the left and right Many say the party has been unable _ or unwilling _ to meet <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s increasingly greater demands for more orderly government, less corruption, greater economic development and more efficient state services. The disillusionment cuts across social and political lines. People are clamoring against everything from a self-muzzled press to deficient law enforcement to lack of environmental protection to neglect for women's rights. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> leftist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have been addressing these issues and picking up votes. For the first time in decades, the governing party's presidential candidate actually had to campaign on the basis of concrete solutions to specific issues, from smog in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the drug problem to a growing crime rate <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> acknowledges these challenges, saying reforms and modernization will be the priorities of his administration. He'll begin trying on Dec. 1, the date he officially takes office.

<TEXT>
 The 50th anniversary celebration of the `` War of the Worlds'' broadcast, <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>' radio play about an alien invasion that terrified <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, was launched with `` Martian punch'' and a song. Welles and his Mercury Theater created a sensation the night of Oct. 30, 1938, with their broadcast based on H.G. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>' tale of a Martian invasion of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Despite disclaimers it was fictitious, the realistic-sounding broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> created a nationwide panic. The `` invasion'' began at Grovers Mill, chosen at random by scriptwriter <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, and residents of the hamlet in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION> have been reminded annually of its dubious place in radio history. In the coming months, the group organizing the celebration hopes to remind the world of the broadcast, heard by an estimated 6 million people, and the role it played in redefining radio's power. The Fiftieth Anniversary Commemorative Committee for War of the <ORGANIZATION> Worlds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> began the festivities Monday with the debut of `` Over The Airwaves, The Ballad of Grovers Mill.'' The song, written locally, opens with a brief excerpt from the Halloween broadcast, then relates the blurring of the line between reality and fantasy that brought `` panic in the streets.'' `` On the other side of Grovers Mill, there's a pond where the water glows. What landed on that <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> site, I'm sure nobody knows,'' four women in leotards sang as reporters listened. The song is to be released to radio stations around the country this week, and will be the subject of a music video, according to the committee. Participants were offered `` Martian punch,'' an eerie green concoction of vodka, fruit juices and liqueur, with melon balls bobbing on top. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>, who was born 15 years after the broadcast, said he used to hear only secondhand accounts of the terror the show evoked, but says people are finally `` ` fessing up to being scared'' as word of his group's work gets out `` I think one of the acid tests of our credibility is we are finally getting first-person accounts from people who had the bejabbers scared out of them,'' said <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON>, director of pensions for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and a former mayor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>. According to news accounts of the'38 panic, thousands of people headed for the hills, causing massive traffic jams, and panicked listeners jammed phone lines to police. In Grovers Mill, farmers unfamiliar with local landmarks fired buckshot into a water tower, believing it was a giant Martian war machine. <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> said a man who was on a hunting trip in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when `` War of the Worlds'' was broadcast said some members of his hunting party grabbed their guns and headed home to fight the Martians. Others, deciding it was too late to save their families, headed for the Canadian border. By Oct. 30's closing ceremonies, the committee plans to have installed a bronze relief at the site of the Martian `` landing,'' depicting <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>, the Martians and an American family huddled around a radio. The sculpture is being funded with a $ 15,000 state grant. The group plans to sell souveniers, including buttons and bumper stickers warning `` the Martians are coming again,'' <PERSON> Forrester </PERSON> said. Also planned is a dinner to raise money for the commemorative effort, the restoration of the pond at the `` landing site'' and a scholarship fund named for scriptwriter <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, N.Y.

 Stock prices took the largest drop of the year Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the dollar also dropped sharply against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 251.67 points Monday, took another major drop of 513.09 points, or 1.89 percent Tuesday, closing at 27,149.03. It was the largest one-day decline of the index since December 26, 1987, when the index fell 587.50 points. In the foreign exchange market, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, a 1.75 yen winner Monday, closed at 133.85 yen, down 1.30 yen from Monday's close After opening at 134.30 yen, the currency moved in a range of 133.70-134 .38 yen The last time the Nikkei average posted such a sharp drop was on Dec. 26, when it had a 587.50-point decline for the entire session. Stock brokers attributed the sharp decline in the key market barometer to drops in steel shares following an overnight fall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They also noted that oil prices rose sharply in overseas markets because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s announcement that it would accept a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION>'s call for a cease-fire in its nearly 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` Steel shares which had been propping up the market could not hold their position any more and finally went down today -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- and that put the entire market on a decline,'' said <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` But shares directly related to the Gulf situation have not moved too much so far.'' Another broker at a major Japanese securities firm said the market has entered a transitional period. `` On today's -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- market, a 500-point drop is within the range of adjustment,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` From here, investors will find other shares which they can depend on in place of steel shares. Heavy electronic shares are likely to be a new target.'' On the foreign exchange market, the dollar opened lower and continued declining against the yen throughout the morning session. The dollar, which was up by 1.75 yen on Monday, opened at 134.69 yen, down from Monday's 135.15 yen, and traded mainly in the 133.95 yen to 134.38 yen range during the morning session. Currency dealers said the dollar declined mainly because of early morning speculation on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> would intervene in the market and sell dollars. `` The speculation lead to a one-sided selling of the dollar,'' said a exchange dealer at a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` And the situation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also helped the dollar go down further.''

<BYLINE>Hardliner Military Officer Wins Key Role In Contra Leadership

<TEXT>
 A controversial hardliner in the guerrilla war against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government has become the first military man to win a key role in the rebel leadership. Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, who survived an ouster attempt in April, joins a seven-member Contra directorate that oversees the U.S.-backed insurgency against the Sandinista government. The 56-year-old professional soldier, a former colonel in the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> under ex-dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>, was elected by a 44-2 vote Monday by an assembly of rebel delegates meeting here. Three of the 54 assembly members abstained and five were absent when the vote was taken on the second day of the assembly's three-day meeting in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> capital <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> ran unopposed as an independent candidate for a one-year term on the directorate, which sets overall policy for the Nicaraguan resistance. He pledged to unify the exiled movement, which has been split by infighting and has struggled to stay financially afloat since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> halted military aid in February. `` Today, more than ever, I offer my spirit and goodwill ... to strengthen our movement,'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> said. `` To our Marxist-Leninist enemy, we promise a hard battle.'' The Contras have been fighting a seven-year war to overthrow the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> insisted he would confine himself to military affairs. Although all seven directors have equal power under assembly rules, senior director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> had been widely regarded as the movement's de facto political head. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> was re-elected with 36 votes to 16 for his conservative rival, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>, with two abstentions. There had been some speculation that he could lose his seat in a power struggle with <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, 56, said he expected <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> to confine himself to military matters, and said he was satisfied with the election results. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>' position was strengthened with the defeat Monday night of incumbent director <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, who lost his seat by a 31-20 vote with three abstentions, to <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>, 42. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> tried but failed to strip <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> of his military command in April when <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> fired six regional Contra commanders for mutiny. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said talk of making <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> a defense minister for the directorate was a `` mask'' for the military chief's ambition to gain absolute control of the movement. `` I do n't think he has total control yet, but that is clearly his intention,'' <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said after the election. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>' closest ally on the directorate, <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, was re-elected, along with <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, who has supported the military leader's candidacy. The other newly elected directors were <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrey </PERSON>, replacing his sister, <PERSON> Azucena </PERSON>, who decided not to seek re-election; and <PERSON> Wycliffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, who fills a vacant seat representing the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miskito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> and Creoles.

 Rebels fired rockets into the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> this morning and one missile blast killed eight people and wounded nine, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It was the second reported bombardment of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in five days. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said rockets rained down on city streets and crossroads as people went to work. The only known casualty toll was from the rocket that exploded in the city's <LOCATION> Khairkhan </LOCATION> district, it said. On Friday, 21 rockets were fired into residential areas of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing 20 people, wounding 34 and damaging a mosque and other buildings, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported.

But <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, a rebel leader in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, denied that guerrillas target civilian neighborhoods and said the Soviets themselves might have staged the bombardment to sap support for the rebels. The Soviets began withdrawing their more than 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on May 15. Under terms of U.N.-brokered accords, all are to be home by February. Both Afghan and Soviet media have said the guerrillas are stepping up their military activity as the Soviet troops leave.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A man accused of killing four people and wounding five others with a rifle as he roamed his neighborhood, laughing between shots, was upset because his pregnant wife left him, friends and neighbors said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, 24, was charged Monday with two counts of first-degree murder, and other charges were expected, <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> was listed in critical condition today with six gunshot wounds suffered Sunday night when deputies returned fire, ending a 12-minute shooting spree that neighbors said was punctuated by <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>' laughter. `` Every time you'd hear a shot go off, he'd laugh,'' said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, who lives nearby. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>' family tried to have him committed to a mental hospital on Saturday after he broke one of his hands beating a wall, said his stepfather, <PERSON> Garis </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. But the family was told they would have to file an involuntary commitment petition with a magistrate in another county, and a sheriff's lieutenant said the commitment could wait until Monday, he said. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>' mother -RRB- talked to me Saturday for two hours and cried,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, a family friend who would give only his first name. `` She said, ` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, why ca n't they do something? Why ca n't they do something to stop him Why ca n't they do something before he does something?''' Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> defended the department's actions. `` If we made a mistake, we'll take the blame for it,'' <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> said. `` But I do n't think that's the case here.'' Several hours before the rampage began, neighbors said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> could be heard firing a gun in the field behind his small moped shop, as he frequently had done before. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, who lives across the road from the shop, said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> then ran up his driveway and banged on the door of Parks' house, shouting `` Come on out, I'm going to get you. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> fired his .22 - caliber semi-automatic rifle into the house, shattering an entry window, <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> Another bullet went through the entryway wall. Parks sent his wife and 15-month-old son into a back room while he called police. `` He was firing at everything that moved,'' <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> told The News and Observer of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. `` He was laughing real strange.'' Police said the gunman shot at cars driving through the two-block residential area in southern <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Three people were found dead in their cars near the shop and a fourth died at a hospital. One victim was a 16-year-old girl. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> said two patrol cars responding to the 11:32 p.m. call Sunday were hit by bullets. The deputies returned the fire, shooting the gunman.

 <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes conducted raids along the Iranian coast Tuesday, a day after <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> announced it would accept a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire to end the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed it shot down an Iranian F-14 in a dogfight and informed sources in the gulf said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might also have downed an Iraqi jet fighter. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military spokesman was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> as saying an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes shot down on Iranian warplane over the gulf near the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Ammiq </LOCATION>. The report, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said all Iraqi planes returned safely to base. But gulf sources said an Iranian F-14 had also apparently shot down an Iraqi `` There are a lot of planes in the air,'' said one source, insisting on anonymity. The targets were not immediately identified, he said. It was not known if any of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s tankers or oil terminals were attacked. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes had violated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s airspace in southeastern <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province. `` They were intercepted by heavy fire of the Iranian air defense gunners,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report said. It did not mention any destruction on the ground, but the agency usually reports bombing as air space violations. The apparent raids were mounted a day after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced it would accept a cease-fire resolution passed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> security council on July 20, 1987. The truce would not take effect until details were worked out `` within a week to ten days,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said on Monday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has regularly attacked Iranian shuttle tankers and key oil terminals in the gulf in an effort to choke off it's enemy's revenue-earning exports The last two reported Iraqi raids were on July 14. The sources said it was not immediately clear what type of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> aircraft were involved, but they are usually French-built F-1 Mirages armed with Exocet missiles and other aircraft that carry missiles and boimbs. The Iraqi air activity began about 8 a.m. -LRB- 1 a.m. EDT -RRB- and continued more than two hours later, said one of the sources, who are well informed on shipping activity in the gulf. An Iraqi aircraft was shot down over the central gulf, the sources said, apparently by one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s U.S.-built F-14 fighters, some of which are known to be based at <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION> on the Iranian coast.

 Flash floods and mudslides killed as many as 18 people and stranded about 1,000 on central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huashan </LOCATION>, one of the country's five most sacred peaks, according to reports today. The overseas edition of the official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Renmin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribao </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said soldiers were called in to rescue climbers and tourists, including an undetermined number of foreigners. Some people were apparently stranded on the mountain for up to three days. The report said torrential rains and hailstorms washed out paths and caused cave-ins on Friday and that almost all those on the 7,000-foot mountain had been evacuated by Monday. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, quoting <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province police, said 18 climbers were killed on the mountain, while the army rescued most everyone else who had been stranded. An official of the <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> province Foreign Affairs Office, contacted by telephone, put the death toll at 15.

<TEXT>
 A conservative Christian group says it jammed telephone lines at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> to protest `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' while another organization hopes to raise $ 10 million to buy the fictional film of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' life and destroy it. Universal received about 10,000 telephone calls Monday in response to a drive to flood the studio with messages seeking to stop the distribution of the movie, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. There was no independent way to confirm <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>'s statement, but the main number for <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, remained busy throughout Monday. A call to the switchboard normally goes through. `` I know that God protects his own reputation, but I feel it's the duty of Christians to speak out,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> machinist affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene, an evangelical denomination <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he feared moviegoers might see the film's message as a Christian one, even though director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> has emphasized the movie is fictional and not based on the Bible. Other Scorsese films include `` Taxi Driver'' and `` Raging Bull.'' The film, based on the 1955 novel of the same name by <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, depicts a speculative last temptation of a dying <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, who hallucinates that he abandons his godliness to live as a man and make love to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. Those who have seen a rough cut of the movie said <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> then decides to reject the temptation and fulfill his destiny as redeemer by dying on the cross. Christian leaders who viewed the film are divided about its meaning, while conservative groups who refused to attend a screening condemned it outright. The movie will be co-distributed by Universal and <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Odeon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for Universal refused Monday to comment on a demonstration held Saturday at the studio gates and another planned for Wednesday at the home of Universal chairman <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>. `` Opponents of this film are calling for its destruction. This is censorship,'' the studio said in a statement. `` People have a right to choose for themselves whether or not to see this movie and form their own opinions about it. The move stars <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON> as <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> <PERSON> Iscariot </PERSON>. Universal will proceed with plans to distribute the movie in September, the studio spokesman said. An offer to buy the film for $ 10 million and destroy it was made by the San Bernardino-based Campus Crusade for Christ. The organization, which spreads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gospel on college and universities worldwide, said it did not have the money on hand but would gather it through fund-raising. `` I anticipate that the money will be provided by concerned individuals across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> who will pool their resources in order to cover your costs,'' evangelist <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON> said in a letter sent late Friday to <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON>. `` Dr. Bright's rationale for the letter is in the sprit of Christian love and forgiveness. He has offered to help pay for Universal's decision to make a film that demeans <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' Campus Crusade spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Beehler </PERSON> said Monday.

<HEAD>Canada To Restore Diplomatic Relations With Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is restoring diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that were severed when <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials spirited six American diplomats out of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1980. The Canadian government said Monday it decided to revive relations after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> dropped a demand that it apologize for smuggling the Americans out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` There were no conditions. There was no apology,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official told a news conference. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. The agreement was reached before <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s announcement Monday that it would accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> closed its embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> after Ambassador <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> sheltered the Americans and then spirited them out of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the hostage crisis at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy that began in November 1979. Since 1980, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> maintained diplomatic contact through the <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, while the Iranian government was represented by a charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. Under an agreement reached in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> last week, ambassadors will be exchanged and a <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> reopened by October, officials said. In a formal statement, both governments said restoration of full diplomatic relations `` will lead to increased exchanges in all fields to the mutual benefit of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Sunday that moves to improve diplomatic ties did not mean <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was endorsing the present Iranian government. `` But they are a significant country, significant force in international events and it would be useful we think on the appropriate terms to have normal relations,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. He said talks on restoring relations began about a month ago, as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> resumed normal ties with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and increased contacts with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said this month that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would try to cultivate better international relations. Despite the eight-year diplomatic chill, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have remained trade partners and exchanged goods worth $ 228 million in 1987, including $ 83 million in Canadian wheat. More than 3,000 Iranians received immigrant visas for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1987.

Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was among those greeting the aviators at <LOCATION> Bankok </LOCATION> airport.

One of them, Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinnecker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was pregnant. `` This is going to be one strong baby,'' she said, gesturing to her belly before getting on a van to transfer onto the plane to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Steinnecker </PERSON>, 29, co-piloted the CT-39E twin-engine jet that made the emergency landing in the vicinity of the Spratly islands. The other aviators were the pilot, Lt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, 30, of <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and Petty Officer First Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neel </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy officials in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said the three were flying from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> when their navigational equipment failed and they could n't make a scheduled refueling stop in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. With only a little fuel left, they made a `` controlled landing'' in the sea.

The official <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the aviators were given good treatment and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> notified the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government.

 A church custodian was arrested in the kidnappings of two girls, including a 4-year-old missing for six weeks who was found boarded up beneath the church altar, police said. The girls were in good condition, and there was no sign they had been molested or abused, county sheriff's spokeswoman <PERSON> Tenise </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Monday. They were examined at a hospital and released to their parents. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, 32, was arrested Monday by <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> police and sheriff's deputies as he drove up to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>. He had no previous criminal record. Investigators traced his license plate on a blue sedan allegedly used in an attempted abduction Monday of a 6-year-old girl that was foiled by her 9-year-old sister and a witness who yelled at the man and followed the car, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. `` The key to today's success appears to be the very observant witness who got the license number,'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, who is deaf, directed officers to the girls' location, and police interrogated him through a sign-language interpreter, authorities said. `` He communicated with us by writing on paper,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON>, a police detective. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> faces charges in the kidnapping of <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> <PERSON> Talarico </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Muey </PERSON> <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Saefong </PERSON>, 5, and the attempted kidnapping of the 6-year-old girl, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> was abducted June 4 while she played with friends outside her <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> apartment. The kidnapping was featured on <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' program. <PERSON> Muey </PERSON>, who was abducted earlier Monday, was found in the back of <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>'s hatchback sedan, with tape over her mouth and around her legs, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> was found in a 5-by-5-by-2-foot boarded-up space with a dirt floor directly beneath the church's altar, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The space was furnished with blankets, stuffed animals, books, food, lights, a television and newspapers that contained articles about her abduction. `` It appeared that she was well taken care of,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` There was no apparent sign of molestation or abuse.'' Officers did not know long <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> had been at the church, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The church's pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Inlow </PERSON>, said she did n't know why the girl had not been discovered earlier. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> worked at the church as a part-time custodian. After they were rescued, <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Muey </PERSON> were taken to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where a spokeswoman said they were in good condition. They were released later in the evening. `` They seem to be fine,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. `` They are talking with their parents. <PERSON> Candi </PERSON> was exchanging giggles with her mother.

 Consumer prices jumped 19 percent in the past year, the government announced today, acknowledging the biggest such rise since <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> introduced market reforms a decade ago. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongji </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the economy's inability to satisfy consumer demand for the rise. But he said middlemen who hoard goods and control their distribution also are responsible. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> also told a news conference that grain production, stagnant for the past two years, is not expected to improve this year. He said workers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 32 major cities, including <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>, were hardest hit by inflation and that food prices increased the most. Prices last month were 19 percent higher than those of June 1987, he said. But Chinese economists do not consider that the country's inflation rate, which they calculate differently than in the West. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the annual inflation rate is calculated by averaging price increases over 12 months rather than measuring the gap between prices from a given date to the same date 12 months later. Using this system, <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said consumer prices during the first six months of this year were an average of 13 percent higher than during the first six months of last year. This is what the government considers the inflation rate. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says inflation was 7.2 percent last year and 11 percent in the first quarter of 1988. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not previously released an inflation figure calculated by the Western method, as is the 19 percent figure, so this could not be compared against last year. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said food prices during the six-month period were an average of 16.9 percent higher than in the same period last year, and clothing prices were up about 10 percent. Prices in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 32 major cities were an average of 14.4 percent higher than in the first six months of 1987, but were 19 percent higher in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and 20 percent higher in <LOCATION> Hefei </LOCATION>. In major cities, <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> said, wages of one-fifth of the population have failed to keep pace with inflation, leading to a decline in living standards. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> did not link the high inflation to the nation's 11 percent economic growth rate during the first half of the year and its 17.2 percent industrial growth rate. Some Chinese economists believe this pace of growth is fueling inflation by creating too high demand for raw materials, transportation and energy. Inflation is one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s biggest economic problems. Under the reform program introduced in 1978 by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is moving away from a system where the state sets prices and is allowing the market to determine prices. A two-tier price system has developed, with key items such as grain and pork sold both in state stores at artificially low prices and on the free market at prices set by supply and demand. Prices of many other goods, such as fruit, are completely decontrolled.

 A Coast Guard cutter searched off the Golden Gate today for eight crew members of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter that exploded over the open sea while on a training exercise, officials said. `` There's still no sign of survivors, but we're hoping and looking,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. The search was hampered by dense fog that reduced visibility to 150 yards. The MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter was 11 miles northwest of the Golden Gate and five miles off <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> when it vanished Monday in a burst of two explosions, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Search crews found scattered wreckage that included seven helmets, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said, adding that no survivors were expected. The cutter Blackhaw continued the search overnight with spotlights. Names of the missing crewmen were withheld until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had notified relatives. Crew members of the Northern Lights, a fishing boat, reported they heard two explosions about 11 a.m. `` and saw the helicopter disappear from the sky,'' <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> said. `` Initially we had some reports there were explosives on the helicopter. It turned out they were pyrotechnics _ flares _ and small arms ammunition, which poses no threat to shipping,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeze </PERSON>. The explosions also were seen by those on board the Lovely <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>, a salmon fishing boat. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Giddings </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> KGO-TV </ORGANIZATION> weatherman who was aboard the boat, said, `` All of a sudden, I saw a puff of smoke. ... Eleven seconds later, we heard the first explosion. Four or five seconds later, we heard the second explosion.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> closed the Golden Gate to ships for about half an hour after the explosions while two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopters and two <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> choppers joined the Blackhaw, two smaller <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> vessels and the Northern Lights in the search. The helicopter, which was conducting a routine mine countermeasure exercise, was attached to <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countermeasures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 15, based at <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> on the eastern shore of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>. The MH-53E Sea Dragon, along with its sister aircraft, the CH-53E Super Stallion, is the largest helicopter in the West, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The helicopter is 99 feet long with the rotors turning, weighs 73,500 pounds and can travel at 150 knots. The minesweeping version, the MH-53E, has a larger fuel capacity than the CH-53, allowing it to fly farther and faster. The MH-53E, manufactured by the <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, sweeps mines by pulling a `` sledge'' through the water, but it was not doing so at the time of the explosions, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said.

They are divided and different, but they must fight together to defeat the Republicans and -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the run to the White House.'' Corriere della Sera of Milan -LRB- conservative -RRB-: `` Behind <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s intemperances, and behind his rhetorical speeches there was a calculation: power for himself and for the blacks that in this convention are represented by a fourth of the delegates `` Not all the blacks are supporting <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but they are all looking for the confirmation of a national political power that they should get through their influence, though this power does not exist yet.'' <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Messaggero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>: `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> recognized that they need reciprocal support, but they did not announce the stipulation of a solid agreement. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does not like the Jackson-style, which fascinates crowds and which is more similar to a demagogue than to a professional of politics; and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does not like the coldhearted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who seems more a manager than a leader.'''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- government -RRB- `` Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' problems with Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s camp were being sorted out last night. The leader of the rainbow coalition had every reason to feel angry with Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for not personally informing him, in advance of the press, of his choice of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as running mate. `` Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has a large share of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters behind him, some 20 percent of them. Their voters may make or break the democratic candidate. However, in agreeing to make up, Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, shrewd as he is, is likely to exact a price from Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for his endorsement. `` The prize could be a package part of which may have to do with punitive sanctions against the racist South African regime. The two Democrats are both agreed anyway that more should be done by <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to bring about an end to apartheid. Their differences may be in how to go about it. Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s recipes can only be described as radical. `` By the same token, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' promise not only to intiate American sanctions upon his election but also to drag Mrs. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> into doing the same is certainly sending alarming signals to the British conservatives. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> can not afford to stand up to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` It is for that reason that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> should be working hard to modify her stance on sanctions. She can be counted upon to do something dramatic to pull the carpet from under Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' feet `` The most likely action she could take is to start a South African initiative of her own.''

 It was cash, cold and hard, and it nearly got tossed out in the trash _ all $ 15,122 of it. The money has been stashed in three freezers, wrapped in white butcher paper packages labeled `` cold compresses,'' by a woman who died in May. A volunteer for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> found the money, mostly in $ 20, $ 50 and $ 100 bills, while sorting through the contents of the freezers which had been donated by the woman's family. `` We had thrown them over on the floor because we could n't use them,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said of the `` cold compress'' packages. `` That money could have very easily been thrown in the trash can.'' The cash had been stored among the frozen food by <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonar </PERSON>, who died in May at the age of 77, and her husband, <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>. Relatives had earlier discovered about $ 400 in an envelope when an ice cube tray was removed. `` She had money in three banks and four savings and loans,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonar </PERSON>, a stepdaughter-in-law. `` So why she would go off and put some in the freezer I do n't know.'' The freezer money was turned in to police, who eventually traced it back to the <PERSON> Bonar </PERSON> family. `` We plan to give a reward to the person who found the money,'' <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonar </PERSON> said, `` and make a contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' The balance will go to Mrs. <PERSON> Bonar </PERSON>'s husband, who now lives with relatives.

 A woman who hid her pregnancy from her husband had only a short time to decide what to do when she gave birth unexpectedly and secretly in a jetliner restroom, her lawyer said. `` In 20 minutes, she had to make some decisions _ not only physically how to deliver a baby in a DC-10, but how does she resolve the dilemma she's created for herself by not telling anyone?'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Monday. `` -LRB- But -RRB- she never tried to harm the child. All she tried to do was hide the child the way she tried to conceal the pregnancy,'' he added. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, lawyer for <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, spoke at a news conference after a juvenile court commissioner ruled that her 5-day-old daughter would remain in the temporary custody of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> pleaded innocent last week to a felony charge of child endangerment. The 24-year-old woman, who is free on $ 50,000 bail, is accused of abandoning her newborn daughter under the sink of the jet restroom on a cross-country flight. Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bresee </PERSON> decided the infant will stay in a foster home at least until Friday, when county social workers present a report on the homes of LoCasto relatives as to their fitness as a home for the baby. But until then, the LoCastos will be allowed to visit their new daughter, <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>, under county supervision, <PERSON> Bresee </PERSON> ruled. In making her decision, <PERSON> Bresee </PERSON> rejected a plea by Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>, 26, to grant him custody of the infant LoCasto's right to his daughter is not in dispute, but the couple's decision to remain together was one reason for <PERSON> Bresee </PERSON>'s decision, his lawyer said `` They are determined to remain united as a family unit and have their daughter with them as soon as possible,'' attorney <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeley </PERSON> said. The LoCastos and relatives rushed out a back door of the courthouse and declined to talk with reporters. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it was still uncertain why his client denied she was pregnant `` to herself as much as others.'' The LoCasto had been having domestic problems at the time <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> was conceived, less than a year after the birth of their second daughter, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON>, now 18 months old, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The couple also has a 6-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Janine </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> denied she was pregnant when her husband asked, her lawyer said. `` Once having told a lie of that magnitude, it became more difficult to tell the truth,'' he said. `` As it became progressively more difficult to tell the truth, the lie got bigger, literally and figuratively.'' Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>, who had not sought medical care, was not aware she was about to give birth when she, her husband and two daughters got aboard a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Wednesday for a family vacation, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. After the birth, Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> told her husband she was sick, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The flight crew, seeing blood in the restroom, sealed it during the flight, and the newborn was found only after the plane landed in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The brown-haired, blue-eyed girl is now in a foster home. `` <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> is fine. She is healthy. She appears to be a normal 5-day-old infant ... suffering no ill effects of what occurred,'' said <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON>, the baby's court-appointed lawyer.

<HEAD>June Sees Partial Recovery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing construction partially recovered in June, rising 5.1 percent after plummeting 12.6 percent in May, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the increase, the steepest in four months, pushed construction activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.45 million units. Economists had been expecting the upturn because mortgage interest rates, which climbed steadily through April and May, eased as much as a quarter of a percentage point in June. However, interest rates began edging up again in July and most analysts expect the housing slump to continue through the end of the year. The sector this year has been one of the weakest in the economy, which has drawn its strength from exports and manufacture of equipment for businesses. During the first six months of this year, builders began work on 738,900 housing units, down 10.9 percent from the same period a year earlier. All of the housing strength in June came in a rebound in the construction of single-family homes, which jumped 10.2 percent to 1.1 million units after falling 8.9 percent in May and 6.7 percent in April. Apartment construction, which has been in the doldrums since the new tax law took effect at the start of 1987, fell 8.2 percent in June to 356,000 units. This followed an even steeper nosedive of 21 percent in May and a sharp jump of 37.5 percent in April. The June rate for buildings with five or more units was 296,000 units, the lowest in six years. Housing permits, considered a good sign of future construction activity, rose 3.7 percent in June following a 0.9 pecent drop in May. The June increase was led by a 17.6 percent jump in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, rebounding from a 22.6 percent drop in May. However, in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, which also suffered a 22.6 percent decline in May, housing starts dropped 3.7 percent in June. Construction activity rose 7.9 percent in the West and 2.9 percent in the South.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> park rangers say a vertical scratch has been discovered in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial that is deeper than scars detected earlier this year. The latest scratch, four inches long and an eighth of inch wide, does not touch any of the 58,156 engraved names. The highly polished granite wall is so hard that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said the damage only could have been inflicted deliberately. Park <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in a noncombatant role, discovered the damage Sunday morning but said he was not sure when the damage occurred. Officials said vandalism is a difficult security problem for rangers and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> because people routinely touch the wall and make rubbings of names. The memorial is the most popular in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and has been since it opened in 1982, attracting 12,000 to 15,000 visitors daily. `` The problem is the nature of the memorial,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scruggs </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial Fund that jointly administers the memorial with the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` What makes it successful is the feeling people get from touching it, from touching the names.

 About 2,000 Arab Americans have moved out of the occupied territories because the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising has threatened their safety and the education of their children, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said today. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON> said the 2,000 Arab Americans represent about one-quarter of those who lived in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> before the uprising began Dec. 8. On Monday night, some 3,000 Palestinians in <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION> village turned a funeral into an anti-Israeli demonstration after 17-year-old <PERSON> Admon </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilal </PERSON> was killed by a brick that fell from a fourth-floor army lookout post. Earlier in the day, <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> toured the <LOCATION> Kalandia </LOCATION> refugee camp north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, setting off a protest by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths who chanted slogans and hurled rocks at reporters. After <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Broek </PERSON> left, troops fired rubber bullets to break up crowds who raised outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and pictures of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Good said the main reason the Arab Americans are leaving the occupied lands is the `` unsettled conditions'' caused by the Palestinian rebellion. `` Many people are concerned about their children's education or about them being caught up in violence,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Israeli military administration closed Arabs schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for four months during the uprising and cut short the school year by about a month. The administration believes the schools are centers of unrest. Many of the 224 Palestinians who have been killed since the unrest broke out are teen-agers. Four Israelis also have died. <PERSON> Faris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouhafa </PERSON>, spokesman for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said some departing Arab Americans planned to return once conditions are calmer in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Bouhafa </PERSON>, who said his 8-year-old organization has 61 chapters and 20,000 members in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to expand the role of the group's east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> branch, which was established three months ago.

 A writer who had to borrow money for treatment after he was disabled in an accident received one of 31 <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> awards announced today and said he will use the money `` to pay the people who take care of me until I die.'' Fiction writer <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubus </PERSON> said he felt `` gratitude so extreme that I have n't recovered from it yet.'' Like other recipients, <PERSON> Dubus </PERSON>, whose latest book was `` The Last Worthless Evening,'' learned of his award last week. `` I've been using borrowed money for the people who take care of me,'' said <PERSON> Dubus </PERSON>, 51, in an interview Monday from his <LOCATION> Haverhill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, home. He was injured and had a leg amputated two years ago after he was hit by a car while helping another motorist. He said he plans to invest his $ 310,000 grant so that he will have enough money to pay for his treatment and caregivers for the rest of his life. <PERSON> Dubus </PERSON>, whose work has concentrated on discontented <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION>, has already won a Guggenheim grant, the PEN-New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Award for literary distinction and an award from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and Letters. Last year <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonnegut </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Updike </PERSON> and other authors gave a series of readings to help raise $ 100,000 for <PERSON> Dubus </PERSON>' treatment. Other MacArthur winners include a firefighter who studies the cultural history of fires, noted jazz percussionist <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> and the granddaughter of President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. Recipients of the awards, which range from $ 150,000 to $ 375,000, are free to use the money as they wish. Individuals are nominated anonymously for the fellowships _ they may not apply _ and a 15-member selection committee reviews the nominations. The <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors gives final approval of the winners. `` We believe that in enabling these extraordinarily talented individuals to discover and create free of financial constraints, the Fellows Program makes a valuable contribution to American scientific and cultural life,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbally </PERSON>, the foundation's president. `` The whole goal is to give you the freedom to develop your research in the way that you see best,'' added recipient <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtenius </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, an archaeologist and granddaughter of the country's 26th president. Ms. <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, 42, who won a $ 265,000 grant, has been studying ancient cultures of the tropical lowlands of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for nearly 15 years. `` We believe that we have found the earliest pottery in the New World in a site near the city of <LOCATION> Santarem </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' she said in a telephone interview Monday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where she is a visting researcher at the American Museum of Natural History. Other 1988 winners include novelist <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON>, whose works include `` Gravity's Rainbow''; <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> puppeteer who draws from Japanese and European traditions; and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Behar </PERSON>, an anthropologist from <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who studies Mexican sorcery and at 31 is the youngest recipient this year. `` I'm still in kind of a state of shock about it,'' said recipient <PERSON> Hipolito </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a private non-profit group that finds housing for low-income Hispanic families in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Housing or a home is the place where lives get built or shattered,'' he said. `` To the extent that a kid has a space, maybe even their own room, to study in ... to plan for the future, is a very important thing.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyne </PERSON>, 39, an environmental historian and professional firefighter, called his $ 250,000 award `` a bolt out of the blue.'' <PERSON> Pyne </PERSON>, who studies ways in which people have interacted with fire throughout history, figures he was selected for `` doing kind of original stuff, different kinds of things in environmental history.'' A total of 254 MacArthur fellows, ranging in age from 18 to 82, have been named since the program began in 1981. Fellows receive their grants in increments over five years, with the larger awards going to the older recipients. Winners also receive health insurance. The grant-making foundation is one of the largest private philanthropic groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> And </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> insurance company, established it shortly before his death in 1978. His wife died shortly thereafter. After he created the foundation, <PERSON> MacArthur </PERSON> told his board of directors, `` I figured out how to make it, you figure out how to spend it.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes raided a nuclear plant and other targets in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> today, causing deaths and injuries a day after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for ending the 8-year-old <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed it shot down three <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it downed two Iranian jet fighters. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the nuclear power station in the gulf city of <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION> was damaged in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raid, but the report from the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> did not provide details. The unfinished plant was bombed last November, and 11 people were killed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at the time claimed fissionable material was stored at the site, but the report was never confirmed independently. The Iraqi fighters also damaged a petrochemical plant and other industrial targets in <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The unfinished petrochemical plant is a joint Japanese-Iranian project. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> announced today it was willing to begin talks on completing the project. The Iranian agency said the Iraqis also launched air raids near the city of <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION> in the southwestern province of <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION>. `` They were intercepted by heavy fire of the Iranian air defense gunners,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said several people were killed and wounded in the Iraqi attacks. The <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military claimed it shot down two Iranian F-14 jet fighters, one in a dogfight over the gulf near the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Ammiq </LOCATION> and another over <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory in the northern oil producing city of <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION>. An unidentified military spokesman quoted by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> news agency said the warplane downed over <LOCATION> Kirkuk </LOCATION> `` tried to violate international borders to raid residential areas ... and our anti-air defenses shot it down.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Baghdad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> report, also monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, said all Iraqi planes returned safely to base. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified air force commander as denying any Iranian planes were lost. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shot down three Iraqi planes, two in dogfights over the gulf and one by anti-aircraft guns. It did not say where the third plane went down. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials in the gulf declined to comment on the reports. On Monday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> announced it had agreed to a year-old <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution for a cease-fire in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has claimed an estimated 1 million lives. The cease-fire would not take effect until details are worked out within a week to 10 days, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has regularly attacked Iranian shuttle tankers and key oil terminals in the gulf in an effort to choke off its enemy's revenue-earning exports The last two reported Iraqi raids were on July 14. The sources said it was not immediately clear what type of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> aircraft were involved in today's raids, but they are usually French-built F-1 Mirages armed with Exocet missiles and other aircraft that carry missiles and bombs. The Iraqi air activity began about 8 a.m. -LRB- 1 a.m. EDT -RRB- and continued more than two hours later, according to an informed source in the gulf. An Iraqi aircraft was shot down over the central gulf, the sources said, apparently by one of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s U.S.-built F-14 fighters, some of which are known to be based at <LOCATION> Bushehr </LOCATION>.

The inspection visit is one of the terms of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Dec. 8 by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The treaty provides for the elimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with ranges of 340 miles to 3,000 miles and includes stringent inspection provisions to guard against cheating. <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common is one of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missile bases in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The other is at <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Both bases are run by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel, but are technically <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases. <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common has 96 operational missiles and five back-up missiles, while there are another 16 operational missiles at <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military. At <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common, a customs and immigration post was set up to receive the Soviets and check the cameras, geiger counters and other equipment they were allowed to bring for the inspection. They are to stay overnight in converted servicemen's accommodations at <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common, and are to eat meals at a cafeteria on the base Under the treaty, the inspectors may check the missiles and their mobile launchers _ which are to be taken back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and destroyed _ but not the warheads. At the bases, the Soviets may also place security men at all entry and exit roads to ensure no missiles are surreptitiously moved out, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're entirely in the Soviets' hands,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` They will say where they want to go.'' The inspectors, who will be flown to <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common, will not be allowed to step outside the bases during their stay, which is expected to last up to 4 -LCB- days, or until the inspection is completed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers, mostly from an on-site inspection agency based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, will accompany the Soviets as they examine the missiles and launchers. Soviet inspectors first checked missiles in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on July 1 at two West German sites housing Pershing-2 rockets. The current inspections are part of a 60-day period of `` baseline inspections'' to determine the accuracy of data exchanged by the two sides. The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors are visiting 133 Soviet sites. So far, no violations have been discovered, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say, and the inspections are about 25 percent complete. The Soviets notified the British of their visit on Monday, officials said, under the 16-hour notice-of-inspection rule. In November 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Greenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> was the first Western European base to accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles under a December 1979 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance accord.

<HEAD>NYC To Lower Estimate Of Number Of Residents Infected With HIV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 City health officials have lowered their estimate of the number of New Yorkers infected with the AIDS virus by nearly half, to 250,000, according to a report published today. The new estimate is based mainly on a reduction in the estimated population of homosexual and bisexual men living in the city, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The new estimates were to be presented tonight to a panel headed by Health Commissioner <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. The Times attributed the 250,000 estimate to an epidemiologist who worked on the figures. The previous estimated number of infected New Yorkers was 400,000, or one in every 18 city residents. Then-Health Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sencer </PERSON> released that figure in 1985 and called it `` conservative.'' In the earlier projections, health officials estimated there were half a million gay and bisexual men in the city, with 60 percent believed to be infected. The new estimate is expected to be cut roughly in half, with the percentage infected to remain the same, the Times said. The number of infected intravenous drug users, who now account for more new cases in the city than any other group, is not expected to change. There is no known cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which is caused by a virus that attacks the body's immune system. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, deputy director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, told the Times he believes the figures undercount the gay population. `` Everybody knows that big cities, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in particular, act as a magnet and that there has been a great migration of gays,'' he said.

 Police arrested more than 100 anti-abortion protesters today, early on the second day of the Democratic National Convention. In midtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, blocks from the convention site, 134 people were charged with criminal trespassing, unlawful assembly or other counts after trying to block access to a clinic where abortions are performed. Police Maj. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnette </PERSON> said there was no violence. The protest started a third day of demonstrations at or near the convention. Until today's anti-abortion rally only one arrest had been reported. On Monday, black activists marched through downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to protest the way prospective Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has treated <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. But they got into a shouting match with a leftist black candidate over her suggestion that they bolt the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, gay rights activists staged a `` die-in'' memorial to AIDS victims while police thwarted a gay `` kiss-in'' on Monday. The march to protest the treatment of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was led by civil rights activist <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who led the group to a protest zone near the Democratic Convention hall. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has been an outspoken critic of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s in the past, but the banner in front of the line read, `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, we're with you in'88. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is still racist.'' The marchers were greeted by <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON>, an independent candidate on the leftist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> ticket, who accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of being a `` white supremacist candidate.'' Ms. <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> said she would hold a `` people's convention'' outside The Omni convention hall to offer herself as the best candidate for black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, however, urged the crowd not to turn its back on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and twice wrestled with Ms. <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> for control of the microphone, saying, `` We are not going to let anybody run us out of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' When <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> left, Ms. <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON> turned the microphone over to the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who called for justice for <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> teen-ager who says she was sexually and racially abused by six white men in <LOCATION> Dutchess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, last November. She appeared on the rally stage surrounded by her mother and a knot of supporters but did not speak. In another demonstration, about 20 gay men and lesbian women affiliated with a group called ACT UP, or AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, held a `` kiss-in'' in front of the Omni Hotel. Within minutes, about 80 riot-helmeted police, holding shields and chanting `` move, move, move,'' forced the demonstrators about 1 -LCB- blocks past the designated demonstration area, where they were taunted and spat on by groups of young men with shaved heads and combat boots. One bystander was hit in the head by a rock and was taken to a hospital for stitches, said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Saye </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Squatter </PERSON>, 19, hometown unknown, was arrested on a charge of aggravated assault for allegedly throwing a rock that hit the bystander, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Blount </PERSON> of the convention coordination center in charge of security. At the `` die-in'' memorial, protesters drew chalk outlines around others lying on the asphalt, while names of AIDS victims were chalked in and read over loudspeakers. In another protest, anti-abortion activists, displaying aborted fetuses to reporters and holding a banner branding <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` The Duke Of Death,'' and an anti-war group known as No Business As Usual. The No Business demonstrators, young people in ragged clothing, some carrying skateboards, chanted, `` Pro-life is a lie; you do n't care if women die,'' and other slogans Temperatures reached above 90 Monday and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials braced for a brisk week of treating heat exhaustion cases. About two dozen protesters succumbed Sunday, and 30 to 40 were treated Monday.

 Moslem Shiite tribesmen bombarded a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> town with rockets, howitzers and mortars for a third day today. Police said five people were killed and 25 wounded. The flighting raised the casualty toll to 11 dead and 45 wounded since clashes began Sunday between members of the <ORGANIZATION> Jaafar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> clan and other residents of the Syrian-policed town of <LOCATION> Qoubaiyat </LOCATION>, 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said residents of <LOCATION> Qoubaiyat </LOCATION> early today repulsed three major attacks by about 2,000 members of the <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON> clan. A cease-fire was called for 2 p.m., and police said the fighting abated after that time. The attacks were preceded by a fierce barrage from rocket launchers, howitzers and mortars, with shells slamming into <PERSON> Qoubaiyat </PERSON> at the rate of about 10 rounds per minute, added the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said several mortar rounds fell into the courtyard of the town's ancient stone church, causing some damage. The church houses six monks and 20 nuns, who were unhurt, he added. The spokesman said the clashes began Sunday, a day after armed shepherds from Qoubaiyat and the Jaafars engaged in a brief firefight over grazing rights in sheep pastures on the town's western edge `` Two people were killed in the original clash for pastures. But it seems the incident has developed into a Shiite-Maronite war,'' the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The residents of <PERSON> Qoubaiyat </PERSON> appealed to Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> for `` immediate intervention to stop the military offensive against our peaceful town.'' The appeal said there were `` a number of wounded people trapped in the town who need hospitalization.'' Qoubaiyat, population 25,000, is the fourth largest Catholic town in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Most of its younger men serve in the Lebanese army. The <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON> clan, estimated to number about 35,000 people, is based in the central <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on the western edge of the <LOCATION> Akkar </LOCATION> plateau, a region traditionally dominated by Maronite Catholics and Sunni Moslems. The police spokesman said the Syrian command in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> was `` in contact with representatives of the two sides to work out a lasting cease-fire.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 25,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> and north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 21-nation <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. About 15,000 Syrian troops also are deployed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the city's predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> southern slums.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign said today common ground had been reached with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' forces on most of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s minority platform planks but the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp will press floor debate on three issues Today's Democratic Convention session was moved up to allow more time for debate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> officials, in a written notice, said today there would be debate on three planks for which he had filed minority versions _ higher taxes on the wealthy, no first use of nuclear weapons and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-determination in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. However, they said they would not press the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> issue to a vote. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates were expected to easily defeat <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the higher-taxes and nuclear-weapons issues, but today's convention starting time was moved up from 4:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. EDT to allow time to air the issues. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign's major concession was to drop a call for a five-year freeze on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chief platform negotiator, told a news conference, `` <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has had a grater impact on this platform than any candidate other than a nominee in memory.'' She said of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland issue on CBS-TV today, `` Our supporters were anxious to have the issue debated, not necesssarily voted. ... What was sought was an agreement that would keep our party together and avoid the dissonance.'' But she said in regard to the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> plank that would pledge no first use of nuclear weapons, `` We are going to the floor on that. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has said it. It's much more in the American tradition to say that.'' Current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy would allow first use in the event of a Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign, in its written update, said, `` We have reached common ground on nine of the minority planks advocated by our campaign,'' including acceptance of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s minority plank on the budget. That plank says, `` Investing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and reducing the deficit requires that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and that we restrain <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending.'' Other <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> proposals will be included in the platform compromise language, including expanded support for prenatal care, <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> and education. The platform negotiators resumed their talks Monday after a six-day hiatus caused by tension between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign said that `` our major impact on the platform has been in the document itself -LRB- which -RRB- already reflects the guiding principles of our campaign: declaring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, our five-point program to fight drugs, political empowerment and many more.'' Campaign lieutenants negotiated late into the night over the details of resolving the minority positions <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wanted in the streamlined, 4,500-word platform. `` I expect we wo n't have a marathon session,'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, chairman of the platform committee, said Monday. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> says the platform, shorn of the usual special-interest rhetoric, is compact enough to fit on a poster. The agreement not to wage a drawn-out platform fight followed a Monday morning meeting in which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pledged party unity and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to increase <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s role in the party. The platform talks had been suspended last Tuesday when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> failed to give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> early notice of his selection of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as a running mate. Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said they anticipated some issues would be left to the 4,162 delegates to decide. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday night on the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>: `` There will be key planks to be debated tomorrow night. ... We are committed to having new budget priorities.'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a co-chair of the <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said early today he thought there would be just `` a slight floor fight.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said defense was where the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces had `` the chance to make the most inroads'' on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' majority. In a Platform Committee session in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> June 25, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces rejected several cornerstone <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign positions, including his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget freeze, Palestinian self-determination and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of no first use of nuclear weapons. Actor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Begley </PERSON> of television's `` St. Elsewhere,'' a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was among many delegates sporting `` No First Use'' stickers at Monday night's opening session. Other <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> minority planks called for full funding of Head Start and the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, and doubling the education budget. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> told the 751 labor delegates they were free `` to dance with the candidates you came with'' on platform fights. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has 291 delegates, voted Sunday to take <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s side on the education plank. The 4,500-word proposed platform is the Democrats' shortest in five decades. Borrowing a phrase from <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, it promises to reverse the `` voodoo economics'' of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, bolster programs for the needy and maintain `` more stable defense budgets.'' Tailored largely to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' specifications, it includes many of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s positions as well, including a condemnation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as `` a terrorist state. The platform is the main order of convention business today before a prime-time speech by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.

 The brown recluse spiders in the parsonage of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have become far too gregarious, and the congregation has decided to surrender. The Rev. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> moved his family out last week after finding the aggressive spiders crawling on curtains, laundry and bathroom towels. `` Most everybody we talked to had a relative or friend who had been bitten with serious repercussions,'' Glass said. However, he said the spiders left his family alone. The congregation voted to sell the house just after it paid an exterminator $ 4,725 to seal the house in plastic and fumigate it. Glass said the spiders survived 16 previous treatments. `` We feel like we definitely could get more for the parsonage after it was treated and we could say it positively was free of the spiders,'' Glass said. `` It would be a fire sale otherwise.'' Pest control company officials said three mild winters and this year's dry, hot summer have favored the brown recluse population. The spider's poison causes painful, itchy welts.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accused leaders of the Armenian unification movement of exploiting a territorial dispute to hide their hostility to his drive for reform, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The Soviet leader spoke Monday to the country's highest executive body, the Supreme Soviet, which rejected the movement to unite the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region of the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> republic with neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. He charged that leaders of the campaign were conservative and corrupt and had `` stuffed their wallets'' before he came to power, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said. An Armenian journalist said today that the campaign of civil disobedience was continuing in the southern republics despite the Supreme Soviet's decision Monday. Most of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s residents are Armenian, although the enclave has no common borders with <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Since February, Armenians have been waging a sometimes violent campaign for transfer of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, which is mainly Moslem and has had control of the disputed region since 1923. Many voiced hopes that the greater democratization and openness under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would lead to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s acceptance of their demands. In massive demonstrations that began in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, in late February, many participants carried portraits of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to emphasize their faith in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief But Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Presidium Monday that he favored `` the need to reaffirm the existing realities.'' He also said `` the so-called <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> issue was being used as a smokescreen by opponents of perestroika, by conservative and corrupt people who stuffed their wallets in the period of stagnation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported in its international English-language service. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s harsh remarks and the Presidium's ruling, which the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said was unanimous, seemed certain to fuel more unrest among Armenians, who consider <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> part of their historic homeland. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> today distributed the first detailed summary of the Presidium's decision, which said a change of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s status was impossible under the Soviet Constitution Under article 78 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the territory of a constituent republic may not be altered without its consent, the Presidium noted. `` A different decision would contradict the fundamental interests of the peoples of both republics, and cause serious harm to interethnic relations in the region,'' it said. The Presidium also ordered authorities in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to take measures to halt the strikes and the protest campaign sparked by the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> dispute. A journalist with the Gostelradio state broadcasting authority in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s capital, said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s refusal to change the region's status would not halt the annexation campaign `` The general strike is continuing,'' the journalist said. `` The Armenian people will continue their struggle for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> until the bitter end.'' The Presidium, which is headed by Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, has more than 30 members, including top leaders from each of the country's 15 constituent republics. He said he did not believe that <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s representative on the Supreme Soviet's Presidium had voted to keep <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. On Monday night, <PERSON> Mofsis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON>, an advocate of the unification campaign who lives in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, estimated the number of security troops patrolling the city of 1.1 million people swelled to 200,000 in the previous 24 hours. `` I knew earlier what the decision would be from the number of troops here,'' <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON> said. `` I knew there would be no compromise.'' However, a police officer at the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone today that there were no troops on <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>'s streets. `` Everything's quiet here; there are no soldiers, and everybody's working,'' said the policeman, who hung up before he could be asked his name. A general strike was called in May in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to press Armenians' demands over the annexation issue. A sympathy strike began on July 4 in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, but speakers at a weekend rally urged people to return to work in expectation of the Presidium meeting. Tensions caused by the territorial dispute also led to ethnic rioting in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> on Feb. 28. Officials said 32 people, 26 of them Armenians, were killed.

 Gun control opponents have gathered enough signatures to force a referendum on <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s new handgun control law, the secretary of state said today.

The legislation approved earlier this year bans the sale of cheap handguns and establishes a nine-member committee to decide what handguns may be manufactured and sold in the state. The legislation also reversed a state court ruling that people shot with cheap, easily concealable handguns sometimes known as `` Saturday Night Specials'' may sue the gun's manufacturer for damages.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman G.P. <PERSON> Cokinos </PERSON> watched in joyful reverie as a roomful of his fellow <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fund-raisers danced to a blaring band. `` I am having one of the finest times of my life,'' he yelled over the din. The <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign would n't have it any other way. The financial juggernaut of the primary season is greasing the wheels this week for a $ 50 million effort this fall by courting big money with a fervor rare in Democrats. `` I have 14 events today. Five dinners! And I'm trying to lose weight,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, mastermind of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> money machine. `` It's like a six-day party where everybody you ever met is there, and you're the host.'' This host wants the most. The Democrats long have lagged in fund raising, relying instead on their political networks. No more, said Farmer: `` We're going to create a level playing field with the Republicans for the first time in my lifetime.'' To even come close, the effort requires platoons of wealthy, motivated fund-raisers. So in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, with a barrage of celebrity-packed parties, the campaign is courting monied men and women for all they're worth. For starters, there are the 1,100 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backers who each raised at least $ 10,000, and some more than $ 50,000, in the primaries. There are old-line fat cats from the financial capitals. And there are scores of supporters of the vanquished Democratic candidates. `` They have taken all of the <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> people, all of the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> people,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Glicken </PERSON>, formerly a top money man for Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> campaign. When <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> dropped out of the Democratic race, <PERSON> Glicken </PERSON> said, he did n't call the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people. `` They called me.'' That kind of organization is Farmer's hallmark. Fund-raisers are thanked with notes, calls, personal visits. The campaign arranged their flights and hotel rooms for convention week. Each has a full schedule of strategy sessions. And there are the parties. `` There's something every day, social as well as business,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Salafia </PERSON>, a Lawrence, Mass, chiropractor. `` This is part of what <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s all about. He does n't forget people. He's not afraid to say ` thank you'.'' One of the first events, billed as a Greek festival, was a classic of political stroking. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't in town, but his son and daughter-in-law greeted the crowd at a downtown mall with the news that she was pregnant. Cheers. Then Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., announced, `` Actually, I'm Greek. More cheers. Then Alpha Omega Sound started spinning out the dance tunes. The costumed dancers of Troupe Hellas hit the floor. The wine and beer and soft drinks flowed. Heaps of souvlaki were served. Farmer worked the crowd. `` It is very pleasing to be made to feel a part of the family,'' said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> computer consultant <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> <PERSON> Srinivasa </PERSON>. `` I am not Greek. But I feel Greek here _ getting <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> food, listening to Greek music. They are turning us all into Greeks.'' Not that Indians wo n't do nicely. Two friends of Srinivasa, <PERSON> Rameshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Himmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulharya </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> said they'd raised $ 90,000 for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the Indian-American community. Chiropractor <PERSON> Salafia </PERSON> said he'd come up with `` sizable'' donations. <PERSON> Cokinos </PERSON>, an effusive <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, oilman, proudly pulled a photocopied $ 10,000 check from his wallet and said he'd raised more than $ 25,000 in all `` When <PERSON> Cokinos </PERSON> calls, they give me some attention,'' he said of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` They could not treat me nicer. I asked for some press credentials and they turned me down so nicely I was almost sorry I asked.'' As well as they've done for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, these men will have to increase their production vastly to reach the big leagues. Farmer so far has recruited 135 people to raise or donate $ 100,000 each for the general election. He wants $ 20 million from that effort. Another $ 20 million is supposed to come from 30 traditional fund-raising dinners that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will attend around the country. And $ 10 million is sought through smaller mail-in donations. The law says only that $ 8.3 million of the total can be used directly for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The rest of his `` hard money'' is $ 46 million in federal financing. The vast bulk of the cash that Farmer is seeking is `` soft money,'' earmarked for general party-building activities in each state. Party officials said Monday they already had collected $ 12 million toward their goal. While the Democrats like to stress their reliance on small donations, the focus this week is on the big-ticket givers. The poshest parties include one held by <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>, and another honoring former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is being hosted by longtime fund-raiser <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorenstein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. At each event, lavish or not, is the ever-attentive <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>. He even got in a plug at the biggest gathering of all, the convention itself. `` If you'll excuse me now,'' he told the delegates after a short speech Monday night, `` I have a few fund-raising calls to make for Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.''

 The families of three children killed when an elderly man's car careened onto a sidewalk have persuaded authorities not to prosecute the man.

<HEAD>Soviets Said Ready To Scrap Krasnoyarsk Radar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chief of Soviet arms negotiations said today the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> will scrap a radar station the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims violates the anti-ballistic missile treaty if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> commits itself to the pact for at least 10 years. However, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s disarmament section, repeated the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> is `` aimed at monitoring space objects'' and is thus not covered by the 1972 treaty The pact restricts both superpowers' defenses against nuclear missiles. Some advisers to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are said to be recommending that he accuse the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of committing a `` material breach'' of the treaty by operating the phrased-array radar station. They reportedly want him to abrogate the pact. Other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> advisers have suggested <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> try to persuade the Soviets to level the facility in the interest of preserving the ABM treaty. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a phrased-array radar is able to track many object accurately, meaning it could detect ballistic missiles and could potentially contribute to ABM battle management. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> told a news briefing that construction work at the radar station has been stopped as a sign of `` good will.'' `` This moratorium is still in force,'' said the diplomat, who once headed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> negotiating team at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms talks. Superpower representatives are now negotiating a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said Soviet envoys were seeking an agreement that would commit the superpowers to observing the ABM treaty for at least 10 years. He called that commitment `` the necessary element'' for reaching an accord on halving superpower strategic arsenals. `` In this framework we are prepared also for a radical solution to the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar issue raised by the Americans,'' <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> said. `` If an understanding to abide by the ABM treaty, as signed in 1972, is reached, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be ready to dismantle the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. The ABM treaty limits how fast and far the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can go in its search for a space-based defense against ballistic missiles. The so-called `` Star Wars'' program is being carried out under what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration describes as a `` strict interpretation'' of the treaty. A broader interpretation would provide more leeway, and scrapping the treaty would remove all legal restraints on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program, which the Soviets oppose as a new and dangerous turn in the superpower arms race.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is promising <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> a substantial role in the fall campaign and the money to carry it out, in what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters say is a step toward bringing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s constituency into the fold. Meanwhile, a senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide said today there was no tiptoeing around major issues when the two candidates finally met Monday to work out the agreement. `` I will say it was one of the most frank and candid discussions I've ever been involved in,'' said the aide, who commented only on condition his name not be used. `` It was a very open discussion with both sides agreeing, as the Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> put it, that it would serve no good to allow their ships to pass in the night.'' The aide said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, participated only in only last few minutes of the talks, but that the others made sure he agreed with everything that had been worked out. The bottom line from the meeting, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers said, was that the challenger will get the respect he thinks he earned in winning 7 million votes in the primaries and registering thousands of voters along the way. The two men, along with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, forged a unified front for the November election, publicly ending days of tension between the campaigns that followed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a week ago today _ and the governor's failure to give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> advance word. Today, at a civil rights breakfast, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` We ca n't just join the circle We got to keep pushing the circle back.'' Later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> worked privately, with advisers, on his convention speech for tonight. `` We're still trying to put it together,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, too, addressed the audience at the civil rights breakfast, praising <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for doing `` more on his own for the cause of freedom and justice, more than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been able to achieve in the last eight years.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also said, `` No one can doubt <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' commitment to civil rights; no one can doubt my commitment.'' In the Dukakis-Jackson news conference Monday and in a later briefing by their top aides, these details of the two camps' agreement were revealed: _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will keep much of his organization intact, paid for by party funds, and will continue to campaign for the Democratic _ His travel costs will be paid `` If the man's got to travel, we're not going to let him fly commercial,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a longtime <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter who has been involved in the negotiations. `` Make no mistake about it. What <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> needs, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> will get.'' _ Members of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s team will be integrated into the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign at all levels, although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> indicated it was not automatic everyone would have a job _ <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters will get close to half the 25 at-large members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to be appointed Friday, and a new <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> vice chair The dramatic news conference just hours before Monday's kickoff of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> came after a meeting that started with breakfast and moved in phases through a review of the campaign, discussion of the rift and then an agreement on a new relationship. Hours later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that while he would be involved in the campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> must reach out to his followers as well. `` Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> must convey to those persons that ... he cares for them, that they are on his agenda. When it is all said and done, the nominee must convince people,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Both camps said specifics are still to be worked out now that the principals have reached agreement on what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called `` a relationship of substance and support and candor.'' That was something the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces had said their leader was not getting from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in previous discussions, which were characterized as cordial but superficial. A top <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who attended the meeting with the candidates and with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said that although the candidates had met many times, `` I doubt very much whether any conversation of the depth of the one held this morning'' had previously occurred. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s close ally, Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the agreement would give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` more credibility'' with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters, but added, `` It remains to be seen whether the people who have been turned off over the past few days can be turned on again <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if his embrace of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> carried a risk of alienating some of the important conservative Southern swing voters that his campaign is seeking through the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` That never really has been a problem,'' he replied. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he wanted `` no salary, no title and no job'' out of the arrangement. He said he is better off not to take a formal position because then `` I would be in the employ. That's not a good role for me to play.'' `` He is going to be involved actively and fully in a way that will bring us together,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for registering `` more voters than anybody in this country.'' Pledging to work for the Democratic ticket, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not formally endorse the Dukakis-Bentsen team, saying he still plans to place his own name in nomination for president against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 More than 1,700 firefighters were winning the battle today against wildfires that have blackened about 50,000 acres in five Western states, but one of 54 Alaskan blazes that charred 675,000 acres forced crews to retreat into a river. `` We're holding our own,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday as a blaze in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>'s Teton Wilderness in northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> slowed after charring 14,000 acres in four days.

The fires in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, many caused by lightning, began as early as Thursday, but crews in most of the Western states reported progress in battling the wildfires. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, however, 54 wildfires had consumed more than 675,000 acres by Monday. Nearly a third of the acreage went up in a blaze near <LOCATION> Livengood </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. A 6,100-acre fire in central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Selawik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> jumped the <LOCATION> Koyukuk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, forcing firefighters to seek refuge on river gravel bars until the flames abated, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Waring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, 327 firefighters made extended fire lines around a 117,000-acre blaze, she said. Crews fighting the lightning-ignited fire in the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> forest have not been able to use bulldozers because the mountain region is a protected wilderness, limiting them to picks, shovels and backpack water tanks. Seven helicopters ferried in crews and equipment, and two fresh 20-member crews joined the fight Monday. To the north, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> monitored six fires covering about 11,000 acres near the nation's oldest national park. In <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s backcountry, campfire restrictions were imposed and some campsites were closed. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, two fires near <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> about 45 miles east of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> forced the evacuation of 20 homes Monday and destroyed a house and two outbuildings, said state forestry spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Heal </PERSON>, who put damage at $ 200,000. One fire was 65 percent contained after consuming 600 acres, while the other was contained after charring 53 acres, said Heal. About 10 miles to the southeast near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION>, 250 firefighters had a 400-acre blaze half contained after at least six air tankers attacked the fire, said forestry spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON>. Authorities said they suspected the blazes resulted from arson. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, bulldozers cut a mile-long path across a mountain ridge and firefighters lit backfires in century-old stands of brush to try to contain a 2,600-acre wildfire in the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasinato </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. About 650 firefighters from across the state and as far away as the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> struggled in temperatures in the high 90s. One firefighter suffered a broken ankle and another smoke inhalation, <PERSON> Pasinato </PERSON> said. Firefighters, aided by a seven-aircraft fleet of tankers and helicopters, hoped to contain the fire by this evening and to have it under control by Wednesday night, he said. In northwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, firefighters expected today to contain brush-fueled blazes that burned more than 20,000 acres. Firefighting was hampered by high temperatures and dry weather. The largest fire was the 15,000-acre `` I Do'' blaze seven miles southwest of the little town of <PERSON> Maybell </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. The fire got its name from the marriage of one firefighter over the weekend. Full containment _ establishment of a fire line around the blaze _ was predicted for 4 p.m. today, with control to come on Wednesday, she said. In southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, firefighters today stopped the spread of a forest blaze that broke out near the edge of the biggest of last year's devastating forest fires in the region. Although the blaze was small, 120 firefighters were rushed to the area to keep it from consuming tinder-dry timber killed in a fire last year. Three airplanes were called in to drop fire retardants on the blaze. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 32 state and local firefighters fought a 20 - to 40-acre fire on a mountain ridge west of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> At the western edge of <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, a grassfire started by a welding torch burned a $ 4,000 - $ 5,000 mobile home on a sales lot, said fire official <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Goheen </PERSON> About 15 fires in eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> were contained or controlled Monday, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>.

The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted through sexual acts or the sharing of hypodermic syringes.

 A fire that damaged two floors of a 38-story downtown bank tower was caused by vapors from a furniture refinishing project, officials said today. The blaze started Monday night on the 34th floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower and spread to the 35th, said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. He estimated the damage at $ 350,000. It forced the evacuation of two dozen workers but was quickly extinguished. `` It was accidental,'' said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` Chemical vapors made contact with an electrical outlet,'' causing a flash fire. Two of the 150 firefighters who responded Monday night were treated by paramedics at the scene for exhaustion and heat exposure, but there were no other injuries. Firefighters responding to the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> fire used lessons learned in a May 4 high-rise fire, which killed one person and injured 40 people as it tore through five floors of the 62-story <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower. Firefighters used advanced communications gear and left equipment at two staging areas inside the building instead of the one used during the previous blaze. They also lugged hoses and other equipment weighing as much as 100 pounds per person up the 34 flights of stairs until it was determined the elevators could be used safely, said fire Battalion Chief <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFeo </PERSON>. The fire, extinquished in 43 minutes, was contained to a pair of office suites on both the 34th and 35th floors, he said. Smoke damage in other areas of the floors was minor, said fire Inspector <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>. The cause of the fire was undetermined, and officials said they had not determined the dollar value of the damage. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> was doing legal research on the 35th floor of the building when the fire alarm went off Monday night. He said he immediately alerted a co-worker. `` We looked out one of the windows and saw flames coming up, and we got the heck out of there,'' he said. `` I was jumping three steps at a time,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, who was among about 20 asbestos removal workers on the 28th floor when he heard an evacuation call on an intercom. `` A few people were following and some stumbled and fell. I was on the 16th floor when I saw firefighters coming up the stairs.'' Like the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower, the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower was not equipped with sprinklers, officials said, although they were being installed. Both buildings were built before a 1974 city ordinance required sprinklers in high-rises.

 Investigators have yet to solve the slayings of two Navajo policemen who were shot, doused in gasoline and set on fire, a defense attorney argued as the federal trial of four tribesmen opened. `` If you think it's all going to be tidied up and you're going to know what went on _ you're not, because they arrested the wrong men,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugden </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> <PERSON> Atene </PERSON>, said in his opening statement Monday. <PERSON> Atene </PERSON>, 22; his half-brother <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Atene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Vinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedoni </PERSON>, 31; and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cly </PERSON>, 22, are charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of officers <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Begay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, whose charred bodies were found Dec. 5 in a burned-out police truck in a remote canyon in southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. In his opening statement, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walz </PERSON> said the killings occurred after the officers arrived the night of Dec. 4 at a party and bonfire near <ORGANIZATION> Gouldings </ORGANIZATION> following a high school basketball game. A month earlier, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> arrested <PERSON> Cly </PERSON>, who threatened him in front of a witness, <PERSON> Walz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walz </PERSON> said the two officers were beaten and shot in the back, then were taken in their police trucks to Copper Canyon southeast of <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. They were placed in one of the trucks, which was doused with gasoline and set on fire. <PERSON> Walz </PERSON> said prosecution witnesses would testify that <PERSON> Cly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bedoni </PERSON> got into a fight with <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> at the party, subdued him and took him behind his truck, where he was shot. <PERSON> Walz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bedoni </PERSON> was seen after that shooting with a gun hin his hand, and was seen pointing a gun at <PERSON> Begay </PERSON>, who had been summoned to the scene. All four defense attorneys maintained their clients were not at the crime scene, and said prosecution witnesses' reliability would be an issue. The trial is being held in federal court because the killing occurred on an Indian reservation.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Protesters bombed railroad tracks and halted a train carrying 1,200 workers to jobs today, <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> police said, as a communist-led labor federation began a two-day national strike against government economic policy. Strikers in the capital blocked key highways with burning garbage and leftist guerrillas sparked a blackout in the highlands, but there were no early reports of violent clashes between police and strikers, officials said. Police said a train carrying workers to their jobs in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chosica </LOCATION>, 25 miles to the east, was halted midway when saboteurs blew up a small section of track. The train stopped before reaching the damaged track and there were no injuries. The 48-hour strike was called by the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers to protest government-approved increases of between 20 and 100 percent for food prices. They also protested rising inflation, expected to hit 400 percent this year. The organization, which claims more than 1.5 million members, said two-thirds of the nation's seven million workers were joining the two-day walkout. The strike, the third against President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, was declared illegal by the government. Dozens of armed police were deployed on transit buses to ensure that workers reach their jobs. Traffic in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> flowed smoothly but was lighter than normal with fewer buses on the streets. A spokesman at the capital's international airport said flights were normal. Maoist guerrillas blew up power pylons and caused a blackout in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, as the strike there paralyzed most business activity, police said. Radio Programas, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading news station, reported the strike slowed commercial activity in the provincial capitals of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Arequipa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Puno </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>. There were no serious reports of violence in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> early today, but reporters said police fired tear gas to drive off small pockets of protesters who attempted to block key arteries into the capital with burning garbage. The nation's largest mine workers federation began an indefinite strike Monday, which has slowed or halted most mine operations across the country, strike officials said. It was still unclear in the capital today how effective the strike was in closing factories and halting economic activity. On Monday, police said leftist guerrillas exploded a car bomb in front of the military's joint command headquarters in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, wounding three people. Police said a student protester was shot dead during a demonstration at <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> medical school Monday but circumstances surrounding the death were unclear.

The letter is nearly long enough to wrap around the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, according to a statement issued by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, R-Calif., who organized the signature drive Among those signing the letter was former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, one of the principals charged in the Iran-Contra scandal. The letter was put aboard a commercial airliner Monday and is expected to arrive Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> for delivery to the crew and officers aboard the San Diego-based ship, which has remained in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A300 was shot down. All 290 aboard were killed in the July 3 accident, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said was a case of mistaken identity. The letter was hand painted on a poster approximately 12-feet-square. The signatures, many accompanied by personal messages, were scribbled on rolls of 3-foot-wide butcher paper. The letter said: `` To Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and the crew of the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, the citizens of our home port <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> show our strong support to you as you strive to do your duty to God and country in troubled waters far from home. You have our best wishes during a difficult time and we pray for fair winds and following seas in the future. Good luck and Godspeed.'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said the signature campaign was conducted over the weekend in various spots around <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of support,'' he said. `` In one weekend almost 10,000 people took the time to stand up and be counted for the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is expected to end its six-month deployment and return to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in October.

 The government on Tuesday lifted a decades-old ban on the publication of literary works by about 120 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> writers who defected to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the Korean War, government officials said. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Culture-Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the action was in line with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s continuing efforts to reconcile with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and promote contact between the two Koreas. The literary works were written before the authors defected, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had banned their publication under its anti-North <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> policy. The government action left only five writers on the blacklist, including <PERSON> Paek </PERSON> <PERSON> In-jun </PERSON>, a former South Korean film scriptwriter who currently serves as head of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, the officials said.

 A unit in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has launched an ethics inquiry of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the lobbying group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION> disclosed today, and the 814-page report of independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> will provide the basis for the review. Common Cause had pressed for the examination on July 6, asking that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> look into whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> may have violated a 1965 executive order spelling out standards of ethical conduct for government employees. `` We have initiated an inquiry into your complaint and we will advise you of the results upon its conclusion,'' <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said in a one-paragraph letter to Common Cause, which publicly released copies. Common Cause also asked <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> to examine whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated provisions of a federal law, the code of ethics for government service. Common Cause filed its request the same day <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> referred his lengthy report detailing <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a step that was expected to lead to an inquiry by <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>'s office. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said `` there's no question I'm vindicated'' of charges of wrongdoing despite an independent counsel's conclusions that he probably broke two tax laws and twice violated a conflict-of-interest law. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> mounted a strong counterattack to the report by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, saying the report's accusations against him absent criminal action were `` absolutely wrong and it's absolutely unfair. The attorney general, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' said <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> found <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had no criminal intention to violate the law. `` When there's no intent to violate the law, there can be no violation,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` Intent is an absolutely critical ingredient and when that is absent ... then there ca n't be any violation of the law.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that when the report is seen together with the response of his attorneys, `` when you look at all the facts, you see that in fact I am vindicated. ... There's no question I'm vindicated. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said Monday that `` the toughest calls we made were not to proceed'' with criminal charges against the attorney general. `` It was not a close call to find that there were probable violations,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said on the `` MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' public television program. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>, probably violated two sections of the Internal Revenue Code by failing to report and promptly pay tax on a net capital gain of $ 20,706 on the sale of $ 54,581 in securities in 1985. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> filed an amended return on Feb. 6 of this year, `` shortly after the scheduling of the grand jury appearances for the Meeses' accountants'' in connection with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s criminal investigation of the matter. The Meeses paid $ 2,875 in overdue federal tax payments and interest with the amended return, and, according to <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, apparently may owe an additional $ 600 because of an error made by his accountants in underestimated capital gains. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said, `` we had a situation where there's no pattern of violation of the tax laws'' and that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` in effect, you might say, is a first offender.'' Saying he was outraged and appalled by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s findings, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that `` in every matter under investigation by the independent counsel ... I have always acted legally, ethically and properly, and any implication by the independent counsel that I have in any way violated any law is absolutely false.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers had issued such a document `` they'd be fired.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tax lawyers <PERSON> Cono </PERSON> <PERSON> Namorato </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Timbie </PERSON> offered their opinion, at the request of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, concluding that `` the ... facts do not describe a violation of any criminal provision of the Internal Revenue Code.'' The tax lawyers said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> candidly disclosed the securities transactions to his accountant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON>, and that he followed <PERSON> McKean </PERSON>'s advice on how to file a return in the absence of the necessary records needed to compute the original cost of the securities. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report found that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably twice violated the conflict-of-interest law in connection with his holdings of $ 15,000 in regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone stock. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> owned the stock in the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies in 1985 and 1986, when he set in motion a review process that led to a reversal of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> also found that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> participated in discussions of proposed legislation to shift regulatory responsibility for the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T from a federal court and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our conclusion was that although there was a probable violation, there was no venality involved,'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was not lining his own pocket, so to speak. Had he not participated in these matters, the decisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> probably would have been the same.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers have characterized his meetings with executives of four regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies which were seeking a reversal in <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy in 1985 and 1986 as courtesy calls, but <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> disagreed. `` The common theme was to protest the restrictions imposed'' on the companies under the consent decree `` and to advocate that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> improve the situation,'' said the independent counsel's report. `` The meetings ... can not be characterized as non-substantive. At the same time, according to witnesses at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, nothing of significance resulted from the meetings.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> participated in the matters after signing an agreement to transfer the regional telephone stock to his financial manager, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, who is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> scandal. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had pledged to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of Government Ethics that he would sell the stock in 1985. He said he signed the transfer agreement because he could n't find the stock certificates, reclaimed the stock from <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> last summer and then sold it. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Weingarten </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney who offered a legal opinion at the request of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers, said he concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` believed that he had made a bona fide transfer of the stock in question to Mr. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'' and that the evidence therefore `` would not be sufficient to support a ... prosecution.'' The independent counsel's report also dealt at some length with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s activities on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> and a $ 1 billion Iraqi pipeline project, but concluded there was no evidence that his actions were for personal gain. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s report indicates `` the attorney general did not exercise good judgment in a number of instances. The attorney general has announced his pending resignation and I hope ... this report finally puts this matter to rest.'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that investigated <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s involvement in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, said of the McKay report: `` The findings I believe are devastating to Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, to his claim that he has been ethical How anyone other than <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> could claim that this report vindicates him is beyond me.'' <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said his investigation had cost some $ 1.7 million as of the end of June. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said he intends to seek reimbursement of his legal costs from the taxpayers, which, since he has not been indicted, he is entitled to do under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. Those legal costs are expected to exceed $ 250,000, based on estimates on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s newly issued financial disclosure form for 1987. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s investigation has been completed, but is not necessarily closed permanently. Last December, <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said it was possible an investigation of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> might be revived in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> matter, depending on the outcome of the prosecution of longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> confidant <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> as well as <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> consultant <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. All three are under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal and invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe. Two defense attorneys in the McKay probe referred to the possibility the investigation could be revived in connection with another matter, the $ 40,000-a-year job for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> said he found serious conflicts in the testimony of key witnesses concerning the extent of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s involvement in the effort to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> to underwrite a job for Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, and lawyers for the foundation urged that the report therefore not be made public. `` It appears that no final conclusions with respect to'' that matter `` will be made public until such time as <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> becomes available as a witness,'' said the brief by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyers <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanzer </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> believes his ethics problems are fading into the background as he takes the gavel at the Democratic National Convention, but Republicans are continuing to pester him about the issue. A conservative Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> group, Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, filed a new complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as the convention began, and a Republican `` truth squad'' hit <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> at a news conference in the convention city. `` I think it's devastating to have <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the platform,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON>, R-Tenn. `` I think that if they had any way to get him off the platform without embarrassing him, they would. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> offered a spirited self-defense in an interview Monday. `` So what?'' says <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` I think that's basically the attitude of the public.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was formally installed as convention chairman Monday night and is scheduled to deliver a 10-minute speech tonight that will boast of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' accomplishments this year under his leadership. As he wielded the chairman's gavel, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> seemed as at ease as if he were in his home perch, presiding over the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. After one interlude when delegates danced to a rock' n' roll tune, he encouraged the audience in The Omni arena: `` We're going to look good on television tonight.'' The mood seemed far away from some Democrats' pre-convention worries that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s problems might taint the proceedings and tarnish the image the party is trying to project in its bid to regain the White House. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> hit team, said the silence on the conflict-of-interest allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not mean the issue had evaporated. He said Republicans would rather focus on their charges that Democrats are trying to hide from their liberal records. `` That message has overshadowed <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s problems,'' <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON> said. He hinted that harsh criticism of outgoing Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> in an independent counsel's report Monday may also have blunted the issue. `` There's enough sleaze to go around, and I think everybody's trying to stay away from that,'' <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON> said in an interview Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, has used <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s problems as a theme in campaign speeches but has eased the attacks since <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> announced plans to resign. `` I'd say before it's all over there will be a few more shots taken at <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman. Easing the attacks `` does n't mean he's out of our crosshairs.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the Citizens for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> effort to revive the ethics issue would backfire. The group's complaint filed Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> charged that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used a book he wrote as a way to circumvent limits on campaign contributions. `` It is an absolutely baseless, politically motivated effort,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` The obvious repetition of the very same baseless things reveals the bankruptcy of their claims.'' He said the complaint was obviously timed to embarrass him at the convention. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he had not shied away from the convention podium because of the criticism. `` Nobody likes for people to be saying unkind things about him,'' he said. `` But the only way around it is right straight through it. I will be stronger because of it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee has been probing charges that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made unduly large royalties on his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' The book was printed by a longtime campaign contractor for the speaker and edited by a member of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s congressional staff. Also under investigation are charges that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly intervened with federal regulators on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businesses. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, said he believes the panel will appoint an independent counsel soon and complete its investigation relatively quickly. `` At most, they have half a dozen people to talk to. A trip to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> -LRB- where the book was published -RRB- would do it,'' <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was quiet on <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s 70th birthday, showing once again the government's ability to defuse potentially explosive events and its refusal to bow to world opinion Dozens of governments _ including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ appealed for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release. Thousands of people held rallies in world capitals to mark the birthday Monday of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader who has been imprisoned since 1962. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> even the pro-government, Afrikaans-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION> said it now would be better to free <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> rather than further enhance his stature as a martyr. But the government responded in its customarily blunt fashion: no birthday celebrations and no freedom for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> until he renounces violence. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s birthday passed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> without a major public celebration or an outburst of violence. `` This day turned into what the government wanted to be made of it,'' the leader's wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, said Monday. The government banned all celebrations, including concerts, festivals, sports events and even a private tea party. More than 30 people involved in organizing the events were detained. The Southern African <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said government authorities `` were making themselves look quite ridiculous.'' But Minister of <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stoffel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merwe </ORGANIZATION> said Monday on national television, `` No matter how much international pressure is brought upon us ... we must do what is right from our own perspective.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said that `` as far as the government is concerned, -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mandela </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- punishment has already been met.'' But he added that political and security considerations keep the black leader in prison. `` His imprisonment serves to ensure that this type of -LRB- political unrest -RRB- does not recur in the society,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said it was unlikely her husband would be released soon. `` There appears to be no climate in the country for the release of <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` There does not seem to be anything on the cards for the next few years.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said she was disappointed with the bans placed on the events planned for her husband's birthday. But she said it was wrong to interpret the day as evidence of the government's ability to stifle black resistance. `` We wanted this to be a peaceful day,'' she said. `` It's our own way of focusing on the crimes of apartheid.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was jailed in 1962 for inciting unrest and fleeing from the country. While serving a five-year term, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the government. The government maintains that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> must renounce supporting violence before he is freed. He has said he will do so only if the government lifts its ban of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and dismantles its policy of apartheid. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for varying periods of time since the government imposed a nationwide state of emergency in June 1986. All leading anti-apartheid organizations have been banned, including the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which is the main guerrilla group fighting the government. Since the government silenced 17 leading anti-apartheid groups in February it has not tolerated even relatively minor demonstrations.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, seen by some as a conservative counterpoint to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, played up his civil rights record today, saying `` no one can doubt'' his commitment to that cause. On a day that began with a salute to the civil rights movement, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, saying he `` has acted more on his own for the cause of freedom and justice, more than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been able to achieve in the last eight years.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> continued to brush aside any differences between him and the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, stressing their common views on such issues as civil rights. `` No one can doubt <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' commitment to civil rights; no one can doubt my commitment,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a civil rights breakfast hosted by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Later, he told <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> delegates that the convention is showing unprecedented <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> unity. `` As I visited with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> this morning, as I talked to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> time and time again yesterday and I listened to -LRB- keynote speaker -RRB- <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> last night, I have never, never seen this <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> more united than it is now,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. In a series of television interviews earlier today, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> emphasized his civil rights credentials. `` I can say I've been fighting for civil rights as far back as the ` 40s,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm no latecomer to that process. ... I would n't be sitting here today as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate if I did n't have a civil rights record. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's record on some issues is at odds with stands now advocated by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, including aid to insurgents in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and support for the tax cuts advanced by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981. On <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> acknowledged differences but added, `` There are a lot more similarities than you have in the way of differences.'' On the major theme of the Democratic campaign, he said, he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are together. `` We are talking about economic growth, jobs, education, health care, housing.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spent a good part of Monday wooing delegates who do n't know him or his record Some found their fears about him evaporating. `` He does n't frighten me,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshel </PERSON>, minority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` You do n't expect him to be a loose cannon. That's the kind of thing you're looking for: stability.'' `` He's smooth, like pouring honey, and I mean that in a complimentary way. If he walked on water, he would n't stir it,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschbach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> legislator. Some delegates made no secret of their disappointment in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice for a running mate. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters threatened to challenge <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, but such talk may have been muted by the outcome of Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Dukakis-Jackson </ORGANIZATION> meeting, which ended with pledges of unity. Aides say <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did not take part in the talks between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, although he did have two candid telephone conversations with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> last week that aides say enabled <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to establish a good rapport. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> after one call that `` you understand grits talk,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Devore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> arrived in time fr the trio to hold a press conference Monday. Afterward, he told a meeting of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> delegates `` I just left a meeting with Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and we have put it all together.'' He was well received by the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> crowd, despite their hopes that <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> would get the nod for the ticket's No. 2 spot. <PERSON> Meshel </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader, called the choice `` very practical.'' `` When you analyzed the political landscape, it seemed more important to have <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in terms of winning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> than it was to have <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> ... because I think we're strong in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Meshel </PERSON>. At the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> delegation, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was greeted by an ovation but also some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> placards. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters said later they were still committed to their candidate, but that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> should not take it personally. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> assemblyman from <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, said he remained concerned about what role <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will have in the campaign, but called <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s civil rights record `` very distinguished.''

 The Iran-Iraq war could be halted within a week, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> predicted after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire plan. But the belligerents were fighting again today. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes attacked a nuclear plant and other Iranian industrial targets today, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said a day after reversing itself in announcing it would accept a year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a truce in the 8-year-old war. The conflict has killed or wounded an estimated 1 million people. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it shot down three Iraqi jet fighters today and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it downed two Iranian warplane. But both sides claimed their planes all returned safely to base. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> also said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air raids near the city of <LOCATION> Ahvaz </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Khuzestan </LOCATION> province killed and injured an unspecified number of people and inflicted some damage. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which already has accepted terms of the resolution, on Monday expressed skepticism about its rival's abrupt about-face. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> said the reversal may have been prompted by `` tactical reasons'' _ <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s recent battlefield defeats _ rather than by a desire for peace. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s economy has also suffered deeply. World leaders generally praised <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s announcement and expressed hope it would lead to an end to the conflict that has endangered commercial shipping in the gulf's busy waters and heightened the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the region. In light of today's fighting, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> leader `` considers the continuation of hostilities in the area a clear sign that the cease-fire should come into place as soon as possible, and he is extremely anxious that this should be the case.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told a news conference Monday he would assemble a 10-member team and another force of at least 250 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers to monitor a prospective truce. `` If I'm lucky, I may have a cease-fire in a week to 10 days,'' he said. The Peruvian said he also would dispatch <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> teams to both countries at the end of the week to work on an early prisoner exchange. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, whose peace mission to both countries in September ended in failure, said acceptance of the resolution by both combatants is a breakthrough. `` The resolution is a peace plan,'' he said, `` and it covers all aspects. If it is fully implemented, I think it means an end of the conflict.'' The <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government, battered by a string of recent military defeats and seeking a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> call for the withdrawal of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from the gulf, said Monday it would accept the truce resolution without condition. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s scheduled meeting this morning was called off and no explanation was immediately forthcoming. However, the members of the council held private talks late Monday and early today. The council was to hold private consultations this afternoon on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire plan. It was also scheduled to discuss a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship's downing July 3 of an Iranian airliner, which killed 290 people. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> contends the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in the gulf made the disaster inevitable, but has been unable to collect enough votes to condemn <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the plane was shot down in self-defense because the crew of the USS Vincennes thought the A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> was an Iranian jet fighter. During debate last week, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and others all told <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that its failure to accept the cease-fire resolution caused the hostile atmosphere that led to the jetliner disaster. Security Council Resolution 598, which was adopted July 20, 1987, demands an immediate cease-fire in the war, a troop withdrawal, a prisoner exchange and the creation of a comprehensive peace plan. It also calls for formation of an impartial commission to determine responsibility for the conflict. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in September 1980 after several border skirmishes. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met separately Monday with Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> and Iraqi Ambassador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>. There was no word on the results of the talks. President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in his letter to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> accepting the resolution, cited the airliner downing and said the gulf war is `` engulfing innocent civilians. `` In this context, we have decided to officially declare that the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ because of the importance it attaches to saving the lives of human beings and the establishment of justice and regional and international peace and security _ accepts the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution -RRB-,'' it said. Despite accepting the resolution, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military command said its troops would remain at the front. <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, Iranian parliament speaker who was promoted to military commander-in-chief by <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> last month, said in an interview on Iranian television Monday that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> had decided to accept the truce. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been saying that it would not accept the resolution unless <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were branded the aggressor in the war.

<HEAD>End Of Iran-Iraq War Would Be Bad News For Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The world may celebrate the end of the Iran-Iraq war, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not. Prominent Israelis say the 8-year-old war nearly eliminated the possibility of united <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> military action against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but peace in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> could make <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s huge military machine available for such a campaign. `` The moment this army becomes free there's a fear of war,'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yehoshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, a former head of military intelligence, said Tuesday on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON> said in an interview: `` As long as the gulf war was raging, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could rest assured that the chances for a war here were almost nil. This security bonaza which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> enjoyed up to now is probably coming to an end.'' <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, retired from the military, is an analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Statements of government leaders have been cautious, but often laced with suspicion. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> he did not believe <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was eager for a new war `` in the immediate future.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> faction of the coalition government, told reporters: `` We must be very cautious from this moment.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s political rival, declared: `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has built a very large army with over 50 divisions, with an air force ... The question is whether it will turn to rehabilitating its country or be tempted to recapture its standing in the Arab world -LRB- by attacking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' The daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> generals plan meetings this week to assess the possibility of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> turning its military forces against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It quoted unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources as suggesting official concern that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> might increase support for <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, its guerrilla ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and encourage attacks on northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Largely because two hostile regional powers were fighting each other, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been able to reduce annual military spending by $ 600 million in the past three years. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> moved closer to moderate <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> during the war and sent word through diplomatic channels that it would abandon opposition to a negotiated settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Analysts in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> feel peace could change all that. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s peaceful intentions are considered suspect because of its history of sending troops to fight in past <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> wars, including three of its seven army divisions in 1973. `` I do n't remember positive statements,'' <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> said. `` I remember all through the years that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was a country which never signed a cease-fire with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> took part in all the wars so far.'' Expensive new defenses may be needed to counter the threat of chemical weapons and long-range missiles widely used in the Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are considering a $ 1.3 billion program to develop the Arrow, a missile designed to bring down incoming rockets carrying chemical or conventional warheads. <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, a leading military commentator writing in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, criticized <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders for not taking advantage of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s new moderation. `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was ready for approaches on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s part,'' he wrote. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was willing to act as a bridesmaid. Due to one excuse or another most of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leadership totally rejected this possibility.'' Some observers feel <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also missed a chance to develop a diplomatic initiative with moderate <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> while much of the Arab world was preoccupied with the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. Instead, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sold weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Although the extent of the dealing is unknown, the sales reflected the predominant Israeli view that non-Arab <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> posed less of a threat than <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a traditional enemy. `` We had an interest in selling for economic reasons and because we were worried about the fate of 30,000 Jews still living in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, not to mention <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> being an enemy,'' said <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimrodi </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> arms dealer and former Mossad intelligence official. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Alpher </PERSON>, acting director of the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that one beneficial effect of peace in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> could be a slowing of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> arms race. `` Countries like <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> that have been seeking missiles and state-of-the-art combat aircraft will perhaps scale down their arms purchasing, maybe not tomorrow but after a few years,'' he said.

 A public school teacher was only doing what the doctor ordered when she took a day off and played golf, a review panel decided in granting her request for sick pay. `` We find it unbelievable,'' said school district attorney <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who last week filed a request for a rehearing in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

The district sought to have her suspended for 10 days for unprofessional conduct for abusing the sick leave policy and for denying she had spent the day playing golf. `` We did n't feel that going out and playing golf is adequate medical therapy,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON>, the district's director of certificated personnel.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, speaking at the ninth anniversary of his leftist government, said today that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has been socialist since 1979. `` There were expectations on this July 19 that we were going to declare outselves socialists,'' the president, wearing a plaid cowboy shirt, said in the nationally broadcast speech. `` They have n't understood yet that we are socialists, and there's socialism in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since 1979. It was believed to be the first time that he or any of the <LOCATION> Sandininista </LOCATION> leaders described themselves as socialists. Recently Sandinista leaders have said that the country had a mixed economy with socialist orientation. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> spoke to a crowded stadium in the central city of <LOCATION> Juigalpa </LOCATION>, 85 miles east of the capital. He also urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to renew bilateral talks, last held in 1984, to normalize relations. The president called on the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, to reopen stalled discussions on a definitive cease-fire. He also said government troops would extend a truce until Aug. 30. The current cease-fire was due to expire at the end of this month. The anniversary marks the day <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas arrived triumphantly in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital, after a 1 -LCB- - year civil war that ended four decades of dictatorial rule by the Somoza dynasty Troops on Monday conducted searches at roadblocks along the road to the site of the festivities in <LOCATION> Juigalpa </LOCATION>, 85 miles east of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> banned alcohol sales for 24 hours in <LOCATION> Chontales </LOCATION> province, where anniversary festivities also are being held. The measures followed three days of military exercises that ended Sunday. The armed forces, using tanks, helicopters and guns, joined civilians to act out air strikes and land attacks. Also Sunday, thousands of youths attended dances to celebrate the `` Day of Happiness,'' marking the day in 1979 when President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> left the country. The celebrations come as a quick and permanent end to the government's 7-year war with the Contras remains elusive. Negotiations broke down in June for a lasting peace to the conflict that has claimed 26,000 lives. The rebels in recent weeks have staged almost daily ambushes despite a cease-fire agreement signed March 23. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday five rebels had been killed in two attacks on troop positions. The statement said rebels kidnapped 10 civilians Friday and Saturday. The government last week expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven other American diplomats. It accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy of being behind a plan to incite domestic unrest. Also last week, courts sentenced to six months in jail three dozen opposition figures who attended an anti-government demonstration that police broke up with tear gas and beatings. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also shut down the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station and a private news show and suspended the only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, for 15 days. Citing economic reasons, the government nationalized the largest private enterprise, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> sugar refinery. Lawmakers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are discussing resuming military aid to the Contras, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off in February in hopes the Sandinistas would deliver on promises of democratic reforms. The government claims most of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s problems center on the war with the Contras, which it says has caused $ 3.6 billion in damage to the economy. The threat of renewed fighting means thousands of displaced people can not return home in north and central regions. Meanwhile, the unpopular military draft continues. The war has stifled promises of social programs. Scores of schools and clinics built after 1979 have been destroyed. The country's more than 3 million people suffer shortages of rice, beans, water and gasoline. Most of the blame has been placed on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which financed the Contras, cut off economic aid in 1981 and established a trade embargo in 1985. But the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> express pride in having survived to their ninth anniversary without the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion they have always said they expect. On Monday, a cartoon in the Sandinista newspaper Barricada depicted a baseball game, the nation's most popular sport, between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. It showed a score board noting 9-0 and a disheveled Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>.

Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said he hoped that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would not be `` tempted to try to limit presidential power.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said that `` divided, shared and countervailing powers are the hallmarks of our system _ by design of the founding fathers. Weakening the presidency also weakens the country.'' The national security adviser did not say specifically what improvements had been brought about in administration dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on foreign affairs issues, nor did he touch on the ongoing dispute with some lawmakers over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s failure to invoke provisions of the War Powers Act giving <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> a say in the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military force in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> did say that the executive branch `` has an obligation to keep its own house in order. There must be an adherence to law and to the Constitution, and a willingness to consult and deal openly and respectfully with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, taking legislative leaders into its confidence on the most sensitive matters.'' `` I believe this administration, after the aberration of Iran-Contra, has re-established and enjoys such a coherent and cooperative process internally,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` It has served the president and the country well.'' Two White House aides, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, were ousted in the fall of 1986 as the Iran-Contra affair became public. It involved the clandestine sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the subsequent diversion of proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has persistenly maintained that no laws were broken, even though congressional investigations and hearings produced evidence that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were widely deceived by administration figures. North goes on trial Sept. 20 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on an array of charges related to the arms-to-Iran affair.

<HEAD>University Farm Research Left High and Dry in Drought</HEAD>

 In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, years of genetic work on new strains of corn and soybeans withered in the field. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, crop failure halted research on stalk rot and other corn diseases. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a parched pasture killed a grazing test and put 67 cows on the auction block. Across drought-scorched sections of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, universities have abandoned or cut back on millions of dollars worth of experiments aimed at breeding tastier, healthier crops and beefier cattle. `` It not only wipes out the whole year, long-range research may be ruined, which means we'll have to start over. It may have effects that carry over for years,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgardt </PERSON>, director of agricultural research for <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in arid <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. However, researchers who study drought hope to learn lessons which will help during the next dry spell. `` We're getting information we would n't otherwise get. It enhances our stress testing,'' said plant physiologist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who is experimenting with genetics and cross-breeding for drought-resistant sorghum. <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> scientists were breeding disease-resistant soybeans and hardier corn, but the hot, dry weather destroyed crops and produced no seeds from the test strains. <PERSON> Baumgardt </PERSON> estimated the loss in the millions of dollar, plus the time invested in selecting the best varieties from year to year. `` All the progress we've made up to now is being set back two to five years. Genetic studies are being devastated,'' <PERSON> Baumgardt </PERSON> said. A staggering combination of dry weather and high temperatures has created drought conditions in parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South that are the worst since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. It's a double blow for the agriculture schools, which also sell crops and livestock to help support research programs. At <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, plant pathologist <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipps </PERSON> canceled five experiments using plowing methods and crop rotation to stem root rot, stalk rot, leaf disease and other corn disorders. `` All my corn plots are shot,'' <PERSON> Lipps </PERSON> said. `` If you have no corn, you have no way of assessing your yield or crop development. You have no data. It wipes out a year's worth of research.'' At another <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> experimental station in <LOCATION> Custer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, performance trials on hybrid corn and fertilizer are worthless because the thirsty crop is so meager. `` About all of our projects are terminated or soon will be,'' said <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, assistant manager of the farm station. `` You chalk it up to experience and hope it does n't happen again for a long, long time.'' In the hybrid test, 240 types of corn from various seed companies are planted side by side at random to give farmers an unbiased comparison on yield and sturdiness. Only 25 percent to 30 percent of the seared stand is growing. `` We've essentially lost a lot of the corn. All the rain in the world is n't going to help it,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said. Each year, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> showcases its work on field crops day, taking farmers and dignitaries around its bountiful fields in wagons. But not this year. `` Instead of taking people on wagon tours, we may have speakers under shade trees talking about the drought. There's nothing to show them,'' said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, 67 head of hungry cattle were auctioned in the second year of a three-year grazing study because the pasture burned out. Researchers wanted to see what types of grasses would add the most beef to cattle, so feeding them grain would have defeated the experiment. `` The grasses quit growing,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>, superintendent of an experimental station near <LOCATION> Calhoun </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` The drought has been so severe we ran out of cattle feed. There was nothing else we could do really.'' In another <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> experiment, agronomy professor <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> plowed under two fields of soybeans after a test for herbicides failed. The reason: it was too dry for weeds to grow. `` It just means starting over next year,'' <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> must spend an extra $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 to feed livestock because the grazing range and school-grown hay and grain are so skimpy. Tests were also cut back on plots that are n't irrigated. `` In some cases, we'll lose a whole year's work. You never make it up. That's a year's progress in scientific development,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, associate director of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>'s agricultural experiment station.

<TEXT>
 Maronite Catholics in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Tuesday repulsed fierce attacks on their town by Shiite Moslem gunmen, and police said five people were killed and 25 wounded in the fighting. The attacks raised the casualty toll to 11 dead and 45 wounded since fighting began Sunday between the <PERSON> Shiite </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON> clan and residents of the Catholic town of <LOCATION> Qoubaiyat </LOCATION>, 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the provincial capital of north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said residents of Qoubaiyat repulsed three attacks Tuesday by 2,000 Jaafars before a cease-fire was called. He said the Jaafars launched the attacks with a fierce barrage from rocket launchers, howitzers and mortars. The shells slammed into Qoubaiyat at the intensity of 10 rounds per minute at one point, the spokesman said. He said several mortar rounds fell into the courtyard of Qoubaiyat's ancient stone church, causing some damage. But the six monks and 20 nuns sheltered there were not hurt. The <PERSON> Jaafar </PERSON> clan, estimated at 35,000 people, is based in the central <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on the western edge of the <LOCATION> Akkar </LOCATION> plateau, a region traditionally dominated by Maronite Catholics and Sunni Moslems. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains 25,000 troops in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 21-nation <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenaan </PERSON>, chief of the Syrian army's military intelligence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, drove to Qoubaiyat shortly after midday to supervise implementation of the cease-fire. The Syrian army is to control `` a buffer zone separating Qoubaiyat's fighters from the Jaafars,'' the spokesman said. He said the clashes started Sunday, one day after armed shepherds from Qoubaiyat and the Jaafars engaged in a brief firefight over sheep grazing terrain in the hamlet of <LOCATION> Shanbook </LOCATION>, on the town's western edge. `` Two people were killed in the original fight for pastures. But it seems the incident has developed into a Shiite-Maronite war,'' the spokesman added. Tuesday's attack on Qoubaiyat shattered a Syrian-sponsored cease-fire declared on Monday. Qoubaiyat, population 25,000, is the fourth largest Catholic town in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. About one-fourth of <PERSON> Qoubaiyat </PERSON>'s residents serve in the Lebanese army.

 People the world around are following events at the Democratic National Convention here, but their interest level often is tied directly to their distance from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We're watching from afar, figuratively and literally,'' says <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Champey </PERSON>, a reporter covering the convention for the French television station <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinq </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, of the Australian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, says his countrymen are interested but not intensely so. `` We're just concentrating on the highlights, things like the platform and the Jackson-Dukakas fracas,'' he says. On the other hand, the Mexican and Canadian reporters at the convention are giving their readers a blow-by-blow account. They say the folks back home are especially eager to know what positions the Democrats will take on issues such as acid rain, trade barriers and funding for the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The Democratic platform hints of being very protectionist on trade issues, which could hit us hard,'' says <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carreno </PERSON>, a Washington-based correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carreno </PERSON> says he thinks most Mexicans would rather see a Democrat become president this time around. `` If the Republicans win, it probably will mean political problems for us,'' he says. `` If the Democrats win, it may mean economic problems but nonetheless, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> people, for one reason or another, tend to think the Democrats are better for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Then, too, most Mexican Americans lean toward the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> of the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> also say they think the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> people want to see a Democrat in the White House next year. `` People in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> think it's time for a change, says the Toronto-based <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>. `` There's an intense interest in this convention and in how the election works out in the fall; we'll be covering it all the way.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> estimates as many as 3,000 foreign reporters are covering the convention. They say 319 foreign news organizations from 51 countries have registered to attend the big show at the Omni. Many of these reporters are especially interested in <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Carreno </PERSON> calls `` easily the best-known <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politican in the world, after <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> of VG, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, says he has interviewed members of the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, many of whom are of Norwegian descent. But he says his readers also are very interested in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention activities. `` Norwegians like the fact that he speaks about racism and challenges the establishment,'' says <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON>. `` Also, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s social programs reflect the thinking of many people in our country He'd be a mainstream politician in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>.'' No so in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've been focusing on Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and whether he will be able to win,'' says Fu. `` This convention is a big story in our country because it touches foreign policy and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which has been a good friend to us.'' For <PERSON> Ingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of the East German wire service <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, a big problem has been explaining the convention process to his readers. `` I'm describing the debates and touching on the issues,'' he says. `` But frankly it's hard for our people, as it is for many Americans, to see a real difference in your political parties.'' Many of the foreign journalists file their stories at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> foreign press center. They complain of being stuck in motels far from The Omni and of the lack of access to the convention's leading figures, who are dominated by the domestic media. For <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON> of the daily newspaper <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, major problems have been the language barrier and grasping the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nomination process. `` I've been concentrating on the Hispanic caucus,'' she says, speaking in halting English. `` This is my first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> convention and it's so different from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where the same party has been in power for 59 years and everyone thinks the presidential election is just for show.

 A federal magistrate has given the government 10 days to appeal his order releasing three search warrants and other documents related to an investigation of alleged fraud in Pentagon procurement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON> on Monday directed the public release of the warrants used to search the homes of a senior <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> procurement officer and two consultants, as well as the inventory of items taken by agents. <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON> said the more sensitive affidavits used to support the request for the warrants could remain sealed another 45 days. Also Monday, the government released documents in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> showing that wiretaps were used to gather information on <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. No details of the wiretaps were disclosed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> ordered the release of four search warrants at the request of The Los Angeles Times and other media organizations who sought to unseal affidavits supporting the warrants. The government said it would also release a description of all premises searched, but three attorneys representing unidentified employees of the defense contractors objected on grounds that disclosure might lead to identification of their clients. Meanwhile, The <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Courant argued in papers filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, that documents related to <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, should be unsealed. The Courant asked for the release of warrants and other documents related to a June 14 of Norden offices and <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and a June 15 search of the <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> home of senior vice president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapinac </PERSON>. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>, a combat systems manufacturer, is suspected of benefitting from inside information to build a battlefield communication system for the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, according to other documents already released in the investigation. The probe centers on allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning bids worth billions of dollars. `` The very scope of -LRB- this -RRB- investigation ... has overriding and broad public interest,'' <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON> said, suggesting the public would be better served if news stories on the subject were based on the legal documents instead of rumor. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> where the probe is centered, said no decision had been made on whether to appeal <PERSON> Kenkel </PERSON>'s decision, which requires the unsealing of the warrants and inventory documents within 10 days if no appeal is filed. The request to unseal the documents was made in a petition filed by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which argued that a month already had passed since the documents were put under seal and there has been considerable public interest in the investigation. Federal prosecutors argued that disclosure of information contained in the documents would hinder their continuing investigations. The documents, including the list of items taken by police, `` would give a broad outline of what the government is looking for, what the government has found and more important what the government does n't have,'' <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON> said. He suggested that other targets of the investigation could use the information to fashion future testimony or to destroy documents. The documents involved pertain to <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, deputy assistant <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secretary in charge of buying tactical command, control and communications systems; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanda </PERSON>, a defense industry consultant; and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Seelmeyer </PERSON>, the operator of an air charter service and former congressional staffer involved in defense appropriations.

 <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> `` Tip'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker who not long ago was the leading voice of the Democratic liberal wing, said Tuesday the party had been too liberal for too long and applauded efforts to bring the party closer to the political center. `` We really got too far off to the left, to be perfectly truthful, and I was one of those who were out there,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` For years, the old liberal wing of the party tried to control the party lock, stock and barrel, and because of that we lost an awful lot of people,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat said. `` Politics is the art of compromise. You have to have a voice on both sides.'' Today, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is much more diversified. `` We have everybody from every element _ economic-wise, ethnic-wise, regional-wise, and that's the way it was back in the'30s when we were developing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, 75, who retired in 1986 after 50 years in politics, the last 34 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is here as a superdelegate from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Speaking informally to reporters at a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> delegation breakfast sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said he is confident <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would win in November `` I have never, at least in 28 years since <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, seen the party as united as we are right now,'' the former speaker said. `` There's no question this ticket is going to bring us victory.''

<HEAD>Outside the Convention: Filtering Out All That BS (Blue Smoke)</HEAD>

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is due in court Wednesday morning back home in <LOCATION> Stuart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, but he thought it important that he be here to peddle his unique product at the Democratic National Convention. The product, to put it delicately, is a filter to keep `` from being choked to death by verbal and visual pollution.'' Its name has two initials that could stand for Beneath Sanity, but they do n't. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> could be found on Day Two of the convention hawking his product in a block-long parking lot near the convention hall set aside for speech-making. A sort of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Hyde Park. `` This convention is all Beneath Sanity,'' said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a lawyer. He used the initials, but this way it gets cleaned up. His filter was n't needed right at that moment. The speaker at the mike was addressing an audience of 17, outnumbered better than two-to-one by 40 portable johns and more than evenly matched by more than two dozen bored, hot, riot police. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> is an oddity among the 35,000 people attracted to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the convention because he does n't want to get into The Omni, which he regards as a megasource for Blue Smoke, which is also not the words he used. `` I'm trying to avoid it,'' he said. `` My filters would stop me at the door.'' The filters, according to the instructions, work best when placed between the user and the source of the pollution. Its uses include filtering out `` politicians saying they are for the common man'' and `` lawyers asking you to trust them.'' Ten bucks, but free to reporters looking for Bully Stories. While <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> was touting his product, a mock trial was being held for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the city-provided podium. `` Repeatedly, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> disobeyed the law,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>. `` The facts speak for themselves and they make a liar out of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' Her reasoning is that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who is chairman of the convention, took foreign policy in his hands by negotiating with Central American leaders to advance his own peace plan and violated campaign finance law by having associates buy his autobiography. A young man named <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> stepped forward. `` I represent <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and the evidence is so overwhelming, my client pleads guilty and we throw outselves on the mercy of the court.'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chairman of the right-wing Young Americans for Freedom. He came to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, he said, because `` the streets are full of red flags and communists.'' The trial ended with the `` judge'', <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgadio </PERSON>, shouting into the microphone: `` I ask for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to come forward. I seek any delegate within the sound of my voice to come forward and defend <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>.'' Nobody came. `` It's a crying shame,'' said <PERSON> Delgadio </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Tuesday praised <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator tapped for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> running-mate spot <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wanted, as a person who has a perceptive understanding of how to reach out to minorities. When <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and presidential nominee-to-be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for their summit meeting on Monday, the senator immediately grasped the focus of the situation, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a brief interview. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> what they had discussed regarding the relationship they had agreed upon. They told him they wanted him to join them and speak to a news conference in an effort to put out a public message of Democratic unity. `` What was significant was his perception, his understanding of what had to be done to broaden the base for inclusion,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Coming out of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where you have to reach out to become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, you necessarily have to deal with the blacks, browns, the farmers and ranchers, the workers,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Your orientation becomes inclusive and expansive because it is the only way to win.

<BYLINE>GOP Squad Sees Democrats ``in the Twilight Zone'' with Platform

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Democratic platform is a gloomy document that does n't acknowledge there are `` good times in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Republican critics charged Tuesday. `` Last night I listened -LRB- to the speeches -RRB- and I also read the Democratic platform. Frankly, I do n't know what country they're talking about,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, head of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> `` It seems to me they're either deceiving the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people or they're in the Twilight Zone somewhere.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is pulling together to help perpetuate the fraud,'' said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. `` That's the traditional philosophy,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. `` It is the tax and spend wing that is in control. They have written a platform that attempts to hide that.'' On the day the convention took up the platform, a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> `` truth squad'' took aim at the document, arguing that it demonstrates that certain nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is cast in the traditional liberal mold. `` They can hide from the ` L' word all they want,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` It's a fact of life. There is a fraud being perpetuated on the American public.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif., said Republicans must make it clear that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is cut from the liberal mold, despite his efforts to dodge the label `` His history has been a history of public service that involves tax and spend,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> intends to be a party without principle practicing the politics of deception.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> argued that while Democrats are trying to soft-pedal the question of tax increases, they would be inevitable in a Democratic administration. `` I know you ca n't do all those things the Democrats here in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> are talking about without raising taxes,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` I think somebody ought to make that point and I think the Democrats ought to be held accountable for it.'' Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON>, R-Tenn., attacked <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who chairs the Democratic convention and is under investigation for allegations involving a book written by a staffer `` I think it's devastating to have <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the platform,'' <PERSON> Sundquist </PERSON> said. `` I think if they had any way to get him off the platform without embarrassing him they would.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> squad tried to turn the selection of conservative <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for the No. 2 spot on the ticket to Republican advantage, suggesting there's a philosophical split and remembering earlier <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> criticisms of `` ultraliberals.''

 <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, newly elected to the rebels' directorate, is portrayed here as the man personally responsible for murdering civilians and the epitome of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-Sandinista policies. Leftist government publications constantly refer to the 56-year-old former colonel's position in <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s national guard to evoke the memories of an often brutal dictatorship deposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> nine years ago `` Somozista Guard Controls The Directorate,'' read a headline Tuesday in the Sandinista newspaper Barricada. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Believes In A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Somoza </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>, also pro-government. State-run television showed pictures of <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> in his uniform during the 1978-79 revolutionary war combined with shots of bodies of burned babies. He is described in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> pawn and the head of the mercenaries, as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> call the rebels. The rebels, or Contras, have been backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since they began fighting the government in 1981. Recent <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> bulletins reporting military actions by the Contras begin: `` Mercenary groups loyal to the Somozista ex-colonel ...'' <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, the military chief of the Contras, was elected Monday to the political directorate of the exile <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> which was meeting in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The election marked the first time the rebel combatants have had direct representation on the political directorate. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> was one of the founders of the first rebel groups in 1981 and then of the Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Contra fighting force, whose core is disgruntled former guardsmen. He is known among his followers as Commander 380, a reference to his number at military school. He graduated in 1952. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> also studied military engineering in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and spent time at the School of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The former colonel took part in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions against the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in 1965. From 1976 until the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in 1979 he served as <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>'s military attache in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Nicaraguan <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> joined with southern front groups and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> Indian rebels in 1985 under the name the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> and was known by its Spanish acronyn as <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>, which means one. But the varied Contra groups never were seen as united. The only thing they have agreed on is that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, whom they view as hardened Marxists, must be ousted. The Contras reorganized again in 1987 as the Nicaraguan Resistance. Representatives of that group, made up of politicians, most of whom live in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, signed the March 23 cease-fire agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> after three days of meetings at the southern border post at <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>. The Contras in recent weeks have staged scores of attacks in violation of the cease-fire. The leadership claims that the actions are by individuals acting on their own. The rebel ranks suffer deep splits. In May a group of seven Contra field commanders were expelled from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for speaking out against <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. Contra leaders, who remain loyal to <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> would lose his position on the directorate because he backed the young officers against <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> was voted off the board Monday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> believes Democrats _ and media representatives _ are rather voracious consumers, it seems. The group predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> would produce $ 60 million for the local economy _ half of it in direct spending by visitors, and another $ 30 million in rollover spending by local businesses and employees. The chamber figures, for example, that each of the 35,000 visitors estimated to be here for the political gathering will eat and drink his or her way through $ 300 over five days, and spend $ 86 a piece at retail stores _ not counting T-shirts purchased on the street. Democrats are doubling up in hotel rooms, the chamber says. A figure of 17,200 rooms was used in the calculations, at more than $ 100 a night each. All told, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is counting on $ 857 from each of the 35,000 people. So are the estimates coming true?

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> proposal to end hurricane reconnaissance flights as part of a belt-tightening plan would strip coastal areas of their most reliable early-warning storm defense, forecasters said. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials have decided to eliminate the WC-130 flights that complement weather satellites and land-based radar used to track storms in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>. `` We feel strongly that the aircraft reconnaissance is important to us,'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the National Hurricane Center, said Monday `` When you get down to warning the coastal population, we feel that we need the precise information of the aircraft.'' Weather satellites provide a broad picture, <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said. `` But when we get down to actually trying to measure the wind velocity and the pressure, we feel that the aircraft can best do that.'' The proposal to end the reconnaissance flights would take effect Oct. 1, 1989, just after the height of next year's <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Hurricane Season. It would save about $ 25 million a year, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Baseball's All-Star Game on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was the top-rated television program last week, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s loyal couch potatoes kept the peacock No. 1 by coming back for second helpings of popular shows. Despite what some fans considered a dull 2-1 victory by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, the All-Star Game had a rating of 20.5 and 36 percent of the Tuesday night viewing audience, according to figures released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. It was the best rating for the game since 1985, said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for research. The All-Star pre-game show also did well, placing 11th for the week with a 14.6 rating. The only other original programming in the top 10 was <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes.'' The rest were <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reruns: `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` A Different World,'' `` Night Court,'' `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>,'' `` Cheers,'' `` Amen'' and `` The Abduction of <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>.'' For the week ending July 17, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won with an average rating of 11.8, followed by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> at 10.5 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> at 9.6. For the 43 weeks of the current season, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> leads at 15.1, followed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> at 12.7 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> at 12.6. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. Among the big three networks, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had the week's least-watched prime-time program, a preview of the Democratic National Convention which attracted a 4.4 rating. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had the top-rate evening news program with an average rating of 9.1, followed by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> at 9.0 and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> at 8.7.

<HEAD>Ben-Shalom Asks Judge To Assist Her Re-Enlistment</HEAD>

 Nearly a year after she won reinstatement, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON> asked a federal judge Tuesday to prohibit the Army from denying her re-enlistment because she is a lesbian. `` I do n't want to stand up waving a banner and screaming ` I'm gay. All I want is to serve the country I love and to be a good soldier,'' <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON> said after the court hearing. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON>, 40, who won reinstatement last year after a federal appeals court ruled that she could not be discharged for admitting her homosexuality, said she was informed she will not be allowed to re-enlist when her term expires Aug. 11. Her attorney, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berigan </PERSON>, asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> for a temporary injunction preventing the Army from considering her sexual preferences when deciding on her request to re-enlist. He also sought a permanent injunction that would effectively end the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on homosexuals. `` She has been denied solely because of her sexual preference and if the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is denied to consider that issue then I'm confident she will be re-enlisted ... She is an outstanding soldier,'' <PERSON> Berigan </PERSON> told the court. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said he would try to rule on the preliminary injunction before Aug. 11 and then move quickly to consider the other motions. <PERSON> Berigan </PERSON> said he was appalle that <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> regulations ban admitted homosexuals from re-enlisting even if there is no proof _ as in this case _ that any homosexual acts were performed in the service. `` Here is an individual who has received nothing but high accolades from her superior. She gets along with everybody and her homosexuality has not been a problem and I do n't see any reason why she should n't be allowed to re-enlist,'' <PERSON> Berigan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berigan </PERSON> cited a February ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> which extended the Constitution's equal protection clause to protect homosexuals from government discrimination. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, said the 9th Circuit case has been scheduled for rehearing and that three other federal appeals courts have upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s ban on homosexuality. He said courts have allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to arrest soldiers for homosexual conduct and if `` they are allowed to arrest someone for homosexual conduct then certainly they can deny someone a job because they are homosexual.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> believes homosexuals are not only a risk to national security, but undermine discipline, morale and recruiting. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> to consider precedents in which courts have decided against involving themselves in internal matters because `` they found the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is better left to make its own decisions.'' <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON> enlisted in the 84th Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserves </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 and was promoted to sergeant in 1976 before she was discharged later that year after she told a superior she was a lesbian. She appealed her discharge and in 1980, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> ruled she could not be discharged for admitting her homosexuality. The decision was appealed and <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON> was prohibited from finishing her three-year term until August 1987 when a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> upheld the lower court's ruling that she was protected under the First Amendment. The appeals court ruling did not address the issue of re-enlistment.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' peace accords with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> marked a fair conclusion of their political jockeying, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> now should yield to his party's nominee-elect, some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates say. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> likes the center stage and that's fine,'' said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolberg </PERSON>, speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this point, however, we're in the process of having <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> become the captain.'' <PERSON> Stolberg </PERSON>, like several other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates interviewed about the <LOCATION> Dukakis-Jackson </LOCATION> truce, expressed no resentment at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s demands for influence for his supporters within the campaign and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` Everybody's doing what you would expect them to do _ posturing for position,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` It's typical, what you'd expect of bargaining,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, Ill. Some delegates said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took advantage of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to notify him of his rejection as vice presidential running mate last week, when Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was selected. But they did not fault <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s approach. `` Tactically last week <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> an opportunity, and we all seize our opportunities politically,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Treacy </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` When someone does something that's not by the book, you seize the moment.'' While the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gaffe gave <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` something of an upper hand,'' <PERSON> Treacy </PERSON> said, `` he has to remember who the nominee will be.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met Monday and emerged pledging cooperation. Aides said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s gains included about half of 25 new <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> seats, campaign jobs for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s aides and rules changes for 1992. The delegates expressed satisfaction with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' effort. `` He's not allowing himself to get jerked around. There's definitely an attempt at it, but it's not successful,'' said <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> `` There was a little bit of games-playing,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` I do n't think it's going to hurt the fall campaign.'' Other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates were sympathetic to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s purposes. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> had to make a point,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president pro tem. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said she was not bothered by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s name being placed in nomination Wednesday night; `` That's what he ran for.'' But she, like other <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates, also said the time was at hand for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to drop his candidacy and take up the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cause. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>, in the next couple of days, has his last moments of negotiating the role he's going to play,'' said <PERSON> Stolberg </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker. `` After that point, he's one of the lieutenants in the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, and I think he's going to be an important one.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s squeaky-clean image has been shaken by accusations that a top <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> lobbyist bought meals for legislators and paid for travel in a possible violation of state law. Some legislators and others say the the infractions are minor _ one of the meals cost $ 5 or $ 6 _ especially when compared to states with a greater history of government scandal. But the state director of <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>, the self-styled citizen lobbying group, said <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> should judge itself by its own standards, not by those of states where such infractions would barely leave a ripple. By <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> standards, he said, `` we've got some problems here.'' <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s lobbying law, believed to be tougher than most, prohibits public officials from accepting anything of value from lobbyists, except limited campaign contributions after June 1 of election years. Common Cause is pushing for an even tougher law. Lobbyist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON>, a former state senator, filed lawsuits last week in a so-far unsuccessful attempt to stop <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> from publishing an article about his lobbying practices that he contends were based on office files taken by a former employee. The article is to appear late this month in August editions. <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON> also asked for a state investigation into his activities, predicting it would show he had violated no laws. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office disclosed it already was investigating. And state Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanaway </PERSON> said Tuesday he would launch an investigation, after Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> announced he would drop his probe to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest or political use in his bid for the Democratic nomination for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON> contributed to <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>'s campaign for secretary of state in 1986 and the two are acquiantances. `` It's like a witch hunt,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, whose name has not been linked to any questionable activity. `` We've all been tarred and feathered already and there's not a heck of a lot that's come out.'' <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON> had a reputation as a clean politician when he was in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, especially after waging a campaign against secrecy in government. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Millikin </PERSON>, a Madison lawyer, said he thought the incidents did n't amount to much, `` It's friendships, a few nights in a hotel room, a few drinks.'' But <PERSON> Millikin </PERSON> said that means a lot in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` The citizens expect a clean government,'' he said. `` It certainly had the appearance of impropriety. If what you read is true, people in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> are n't going to like it.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauda </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> director of Common Cause, said the incidents are serious for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, whose reputation for honest government dates to the turn-of-the-century Progressive movement. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> has n't had a major government scandal this century, since Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> `` Fighting Bob'' <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> ended the railroad lobby's stranglehold on the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1903. The state secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> says he is a distant relative of the former governor. `` We're not quite as clean as people would like to have you believe,'' <PERSON> Hauda </PERSON> said. `` You have to judge things based on community standards, just like obscenity. Based on <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s standards, we've got some problems here. <PERSON> Hauda </PERSON>'s group said <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON>'s wife, attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rottier </PERSON>, gave thousands of dollars to more than 30 legislators' campaigns, which she defended as her right. <PERSON> Hauda </PERSON> argued that was a method used by lobbyists to circumvent lobbying restrictions. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> has not said what its article will say, but some legislators have admitted taking favors from <LOCATION> Goyke </LOCATION>. State Rep. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> accepted a $ 5 or $ 6 fish dinner from <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otte </PERSON>, a former legislator and employee of <LOCATION> Goyke </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a former state representative, failed to report $ 247 in air fares for members of his family accepted from <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON>'s clients, to a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> health-care conference at which <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> spoke. Several legislators attended a <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packer-Chicago </ORGANIZATION> Bears game in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, possibly at <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON>'s expense. State Sen. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Sistine </PERSON> acknowledged accepting two nights of lodging in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> during his honeymoon as a present from <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON>'s wife, a family friend. <PERSON> Goyke </PERSON> says he intends to reclaim his image. `` I believe in being a nice guy. I like the legislative process. I respect it,'' he said. `` I think that we have a very, very clean state, I honestly do.''

 A leftist guerrilla group claimed responsibility Tuesday for an attack that injured six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. In a communique distributed to local newspapers, the <ORGANIZATION> Cinchonero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> said the `` Lempira Command'' attacked the soldiers in `` memory of the first Honduran war chief who led an armed resistence against foreign invaders.'' The six soldiers were in good condition Tuesday at <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, headquarters for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON> said. They were among a group of nine soldiers who were leaving a discotheque in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, 125 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, in a rented van Sunday when assailants hurled a grenade and opened fire on them from another vehicle. One of the six injured was treated and released Sunday. The other five were hositalized. `` As long as there is a <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> military and Nicaraguan counterrevolutionary presence here there will never be peace,'' the guerrilla group's communique said. `` Said peace will not be achieved while the puppet army defends the rich exploiters of our people.'' `` We tell our peole that the gringos are not invincible, bullets also pierce them, which has alrady been demonstrated by the heroic peoples of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' it said. Col. <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> <PERSON> Soleno </PERSON>, commander of the Honduran army's 105th infantry brigade in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, said on Tuesday officials had no leads in the case. `` We consider the attack an isolated action whose investigation will follow the course of the law to provide tranquility to the citizens,'' <PERSON> Avila </PERSON> <PERSON> Soleno </PERSON> said. However, newspapers reported Tuesday that the secret police had arrested six people in the case. Military intelligence sources said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION> to work on the case. The Cinchonero guerrillas emerged in 1979 as the first armed group of the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has operated underground since it was founded in 1950. <PERSON> Lempira </PERSON> was a Maya Indian chief who fought against <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> conquerors. Authorities blame the group for more than 10 terrorist attacks againt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, the hijackings of three commercial airliners between 1979 and 1983, and the kidnappings of businessmen. President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday the government was worried about the attack. `` We believe that action apparently is part of a destabilizing plan of the international left.''

 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday that they have ruled out vandalism as the cause of a 4-inch scratch on the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial and that the damage has been there since the wall was built. `` We were greatly relieved to rule out vandalism,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She said the hairline scratch, which is 4 inches long and an eighth of an inch wide, was made when names of fallen servicemen were sandblasted onto one of the wall's 121 granite panels. The engravers decided to finish the job without removing the scratch, <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said. The scratch was discovered on Sunday by a park ranger. `` It's such a shallow mark, it was nearly invisible,'' <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said. `` Unless the light is right, it's very difficult to see. I'm sure that's why it was n't discovered before. The memorial, which includes the names of 58,156 military personnel known to have been killed in the Vietnam War, opened on Veterans Day 1982. It quickly became the most popular monument in the nation's capital, and now attracts 12,000 to 15,000 visitors daily. Two months ago, the memorial was scratched and defaced by vandals. More than $ 80,000 has been raised through private donations to repair that damage, although work has not yet begun, <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> paid out nearly $ 60 and a lesson in human nature to students in his remedial math class this summer. In return, he got his students' attention, and that was worth every penny, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> says.

The students were told they would be paid up to 20 cents per day, depending on attendance, behavior and performance. `` It gives them a purpose for being here. Students have to have goals to achieve, and this gave them something as a goal,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. The change in attitude was almost immediate. `` They were aware of it when I put their name on the board -LRB- for misbehaving -RRB-. They knew they were losing money,'' the teacher said. Payday was Friday, the end of the term. Students were paid $ 4.70 down to $ 1.70. No one got the maximum $ 5 for the six-week session. `` They left a little richer than they came in, in one way or another. If that makes a lasting impression, then it was worth it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jackson Delegates Cool To Jackson-Dukakis Solidarity Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is a notable lack of enthusiasm among <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers about his solidarity agreement with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even as they express hope the relationship could bring tangible victories in the future. The official <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign line on the <LOCATION> Jackson-Dukakis </LOCATION> agreement is a positive one _ emphasizing the agreement in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will involve <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his staff in the general election, providing resources for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to campaign for the Democrats. But many <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters, who wanted their candidate on the ticket, are disappointed in the agreement, campaign aides acknowledged. `` The important thing here is that <PERSON> Reverend </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who was disturbed over feeling that he was not being properly courted by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people, is now satisfied,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>. But even among some who were putting out the positive `` spin,'' there was at times as much resignation as enthusiasm in the reaction, and acknowledgement that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s constituency might not buy into it. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the agreement would give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` more credibility'' with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters, but added, `` It remains to be seen whether the people who have been turned off over the past few days can be turned on again. `` There is nothing really to be happy about,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a key <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser. `` The only thing we have gained is entering an atmosphere where -LRB- the two campaigns -RRB- can work out a strategy to win,'' in November. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said that was how it should be among members of the same political party. So the Jackson-Dukakis arrangement really puts them at what he considers the starting gate. For that reason, he said he would hardly consider Monday's agreement a victory. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has mentioned the agreement only fleetingly in speeches since he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced it, focusing instead on his future agenda and the issues he has highlighted throughout his campaign. In answer to the question `` What did <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> get?'' some of his supporters see only crumbs from the agreement announced with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` The only thing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave up was the opportunity to lose,'' without <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support, said <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>. As to the agreement that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> staff members would be integrated into the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> team, <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said, `` I do n't see why if you sacrifice your advisers and time'' to help another candidate, `` that this is a great accomplishment.'' Officially, key advisers say the new attitude and respect shown by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is what is most important and specifics can follow from there. The future will tell if the new relationship pans out into real access and influence by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' politics, they said. `` We have to take him for his word that he will include <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a very substantial and meaningful way,'' said Assemblywoman Maxine Waters of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. An aide to one <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> congressional adviser said his boss was `` very disappointed'' and felt the concessions to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were not particularly meaningful. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> agreed to push for legislation on a number of issues he already supports _ tougher sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, statehood for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, simplification of voter registration, and greater commitment to minority business set-aside programs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also won party rules changes so he can get nearly half the 25 at-large members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and a new <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> vice chair. `` So what?'' said the congressional aide to all of the above. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> noted, however, that, `` People do n't realize you do n't get anything at a convention unless you win.'' And, he added, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` did n't really need anything,'' because he has an enthusiastic following and can go his own way outside of traditional political bargains. A close <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> confidant, former <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration official <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, refuses to entertain talk of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> losing anything in light of what he has accomplished with his campaign. Looking out on a street lined with about 250 cheering people who gathered Tuesday to wait for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> outside a small, unannounced breakfast speech, <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> insisted, `` He won. There are no advance people putting this on.'' And he said of the convention, `` They do n't give out door prizes down there.''

 The derailment of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train near <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, occurred last October after a workman failed to restore a track switch to its proper position, a federal investigation concluded Tuesday. The two locomotives and 11 of 14 passenger cars of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Zephyr'' collided with maintenance equipment on a side track, injuring 15 crew members and 107 of the 230 passengers aboard The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> concluded in its report on the Oct. 12, 1987, accident that a laborer who had used the maintenance equipment had parked it on a siding, but failed to return the switch for through-traffic use. Blood and urine samples from the <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Northern Railroad workman later showed small traces of marijuana, but the levels were so small that the board could not link drug use specifically to the accident. The board also blamed the crane operator and a track forman for failing to check the switch and criticized the management of the <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the track, for inadequate training of maintenance crews and not reducing the track speed in the work area. The safety board also said that a signal banner at the switch, which would have warned the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> engineer that he was about to head onto a track siding, was so rusted that it was difficult to see. The <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train, traveling about 60 miles an hour, went onto the side track and plowed into the equipment, which included a maintenance crane and three flat cars, the safety board said. The eastbound Zephyr was traveling on the westbound track at the time of the accident because a stretch of the eastbound track had been closed for repairs. The board also said that the severity of some of the passengers' injuries was increased because items like television sets, coffee makers and seat cushions broke free inside the <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> cars during the accident

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a spirit of unity, yields center stage tonight to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for a speech certain to ignite a thunderous rally at the Democratic National Convention. He'll deliver `` an upbeat speech,'' Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, predicted today Democratic leaders including <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the man who got the No. 2 spot <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sought, were all emphasizing harmony today. Before <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> goes on, delegates will debate three platform planks that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wants changed, but agreements to disagree without anger apparently have been worked out. `` I think it's going to be a good debate, but I do n't think it's going to be divisive and I do n't think it will be rancorous,'' Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter closely involved with platform deliberations, said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> Today's convention starting time was moved up from 4:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. EDT to allow more time for debate, but then was pushed back to 4:15 p.m. because so few delegates showed up. While unity was the convention byword, there was trouble on the streets on the third day of demonstrations. Just blocks from the convention site, police arrested 134 anti-abortion protesters at a clinic where abortions are performed. They were charged with criminal trespassing, unlawful assembly or other counts. Until today, only one arrest had been reported. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visited the gravesite of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and praised the slain civil rights leader as `` a man of action, a man of inspiration. He cared very deeply about some basic human values.'' King's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` We wish you well in this effort because we are counting on you to set things right again.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>, showed no concern about platform differences being aired on televison tonight. `` If they bring these issues to the floor, well that's the way conventions are supposed to go,'' he said. Asked on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> if he expected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s address to have a theme of unity, he said, `` I certainly expect it will be an upbeat speech.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the runner-up reluctant to quit, was given 28 minutes _ starting at 10:21 p.m. EDT _ to address the 5,372 delegates and alternates, following a video tribute to his campaign and his cause. `` The tone has to do with bold leadership,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, previewing his remarks. `` That's what we need: new direction, sound ideas and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must never surrender to be bigger and be better.'' Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will have their names put in nomination for the presidency but it will be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who stands at the podium Thursday night to claim the prize. With his rival wielding overwhelming power, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> struck a gentleman's agreement on platform disputes, agreeing to withdraw 10 of 13 minority planks he championed. His biggest concession was dropping a demand for a five-year freeze on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. Party sources said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would instruct his delegates to vote down <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for higher taxes on the wealthy and no first use of nuclear weapons, and that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> homeland would be debated and then withdrawn without a vote. In a convention fine tuned for television viewers, the Democrats set aside their customary wrangling over rules and credentials _ adopting reports from those committees in a blink of an eye _ and brought forth humorist <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Keillor </PERSON> and a bevy of elementary-school children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and sing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthem </ORGANIZATION>. The convention opened _ on time _ with attacks on the record of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the competence of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the certain presidential nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the keynote speaker, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in eight years as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vice president, `` has n't displayed the slightest interest in anything we care about. And now that he's after a job he ca n't get appointed to, he's like <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> discovering <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> He's found child care. He's found education.'' `` Poor <PERSON> George </PERSON>, he ca n't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth,'' she said, sending the crowd into roars of laughters and applause. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> telephoned her afterwards with congratulations. `` What am I going to say on Thursday? You said it all,'' he told her. Predictably, Republicans did n't like the barbs. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, said Americans `` are more interested in leadership than laugh lines. Her audience liked it. I'm not sure how well it will play everywhere else. I do n't think nastiness ever plays very well.'' No one could accuse the Democrats of conducting their business in a smoke-filled room. Democratic National Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> ruled at that outset that smoking was forbidden. Neither <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made an appearance at the convention Monday, instead watching it on television _ when they were n't on television themselves in network interviews. `` It's a madhouse, but I love it,'' state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Feleciano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, shouted to a camera crew on the convention floor. He said the summit meeting between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> earlier in the day had put many delegates at ease. `` Sure, people are still loyal to their candidate, but we're sitting hand in hand, laughing and joking The animosity is not there anymore,'' <PERSON> Feleciano </PERSON> said. Not everyone felt that way. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter from <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, said, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not attractive, but I do n't think we can say <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at any price.'' Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, his hair turned gray, exhorted the delegates to pursue `` Unity, one more time, unity.'' In a revised version of his 1976 campaign slogan, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said, `` My name is <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and I am not running for president. Did you hear that <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' It was a pointed jab at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who often holds up the Carter years to ridicule. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met for nearly three hours Monday morning to clear up disputes that had threatened to disrupt the convention. After their talks, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would not challenge <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as running mate In return, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his supporters were promised greater standing in the party, up to half of the 25 at-large slots on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and resources to campaign on behalf of the ticket this fall.

 Soaring at 2,000 feet in a glider gave personnel manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> a whole new perspective on risks in the business world. `` When you take a risk doing that, you go back and think about taking a risk making a business decision. It's no big deal,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who works for the <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maynard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> took the half-hour glider ride as part of a four-week program for upper-level managers that began July 11. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicere </PERSON>, who runs the 22-year-old Executive Management Program at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the extracurricular activities are intended to push the current class of 36 managers from 10 countries completely out of their element. `` It's an attempt to open their minds to new concepts by also having them experience new things,'' <PERSON> Vicere </PERSON> said. Other eye-opening activities include snake handling and scuba lessons, plus at least seven hours a day in class. Executives taking part in the $ 8,500 program came from as far as <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. Most are in their mid-40s and work for large corporations, according to <PERSON> Vicere </PERSON>. There are four classes scheduled per year. During the day, they attend courses on internationalization of the business world, government-business relations and leadership and management, he said. They also have some evening sessions and as much as two hours of homework a day. In what little spare time remains, <PERSON> Vicere </PERSON> gives the managers a chance to take golf, racquetball, tennis and scuba lessons. Besides providing new experiences, the activities promote camaraderie, <PERSON> Vicere </PERSON> said. He also has shuttled the managers to <PERSON> Shaver </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and plans an all-day canoe trip. All activities are voluntary, <PERSON> Vicere </PERSON> said. At the environmental center on the opening day of the program, <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> staff director <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said she handled a black rat snake. `` This is a week of firsts,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who also took a glider ride and golf lessons. `` On the postcards I'm sending, I'm writing, ` I'm doing this and I'm doing that,' and at the bottom, I put, ` P.S., I'm also working very hard,''' she said. On Sunday, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> stood with two other classmates along the edge of a narrow, 1,000-foot asphalt runway, waiting to ride in a bullet-shaped, two-seat glider at Ridge Soaring Gliderport. `` They're teaching us new things and new ideas, this fits right in,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, a district engineer for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a data processing auditing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, added, `` This is not the sort of thing auditors generally do. Other universities, including business schools at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, also take corporate executives outdoors. <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> offers a weekend sailing trip on the <LOCATION> Chesaspeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> as part of its program. `` It really emphasizes bringing the whole class together,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalton </PERSON>, director of executive education at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> offered Tuesday to scrap a radar station the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says is in violation of the anti-ballistic missile treaty if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will honor the 1972 pact for at least 10 more years. <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> disarmament section, also repeated the Kremlin contention that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> is `` aimed at monitoring space objects'' and thus outside the ABM treaty, which restricts superpower defenses against nuclear missiles. Some advisers to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> are said to recommend that he accuse the Soviets of making a `` material breach'' of the treaty with the phased-array radar station and abrogate the agreement. Other advisers have suggested <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> try to persuade the Soviets to raze the facility in the interest of preserving the ABM accord. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, a phased-array radar is able to track many objects accurately, meaning it could detect ballistic missiles and contribute to ABM battle management. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, who is in charge of Soviet arms negotiations, told a news briefing that construction work at the radar station has been stopped as a sign of `` good will.'' `` This moratorium is still in force,'' he said. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> once led the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> delegation to U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where negotiators now are discussing a 50 percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons. He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> wants an arrangement that would commit the superpowers to the ABM treaty for at least 10 years, describing that as `` the necessary element'' for such an agreement on long-range nuclear arms. `` In this framework we are prepared also for a radical solution to the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar issue raised by the Americans,'' he said. `` If an understanding to abide by the ABM treaty, as signed in 1972, is reached, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be ready to dismantle the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The ABM treaty limits how fast and far the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can go in its plan for a space-based defense against ballistic missiles. The Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly called `` Star Wars,'' is being carried out under what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration calls a `` strict interpretation'' of the treaty. Broader interpretation would provide more leeway and scrapping the agreement would remove all legal restraints on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program, which the Soviets say represents a new and dangerous stage of the arms race.

 The remains of a soldier believed to be an American missing since World War II have been discovered on a remote <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Our records show that 12 American soldiers were stationed there during World War II, and only 11 came home,'' <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiglitz </PERSON>, the service's regional director, said Monday. `` After 45 years of missing in action, the 12th soldier is finally coming home too.'' Fish & amp; Wildlife biologists on <LOCATION> Buldir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> found a skull, leg, arm and pelvic bones a few yards from their camp earlier this month. The biologists are studying seabirds on the tiny, rocky island about 1550 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Diters </PERSON>, an archaeologist at the agency's <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> headquarters, said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military boots, an M-1 rifle with bayonet, an American coin and a pocketwatch inscribed with `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' were found with the bones. A wallet also was recovered, but <PERSON> Diters </PERSON> said its contents were deteriorated too much to make an immediate identification of the owner. `` The body was wedged into some large boulders, as if the soldier may have been trying to escape from the weather,'' said biologist <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON>. `` The terrain is very rough and disorienting there. He probably got lost and died of exposure.'' The remains were found about four miles from what is left of a military camp on the northwest corner of the island. The remains and personal effects were being taken by boat to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Base at Adak. Military spokesmen in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> said Tuesday they did not know the name of the missing soldier or what would be the next step in identifying the remains. A Fish & amp; Wildlife spokesman said the remains were found July 12 or 13, but radio communications with <PERSON> Buldir </PERSON> are difficult and he was not sure of the date. The 5,000-acre island is halfway between <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION>, two islands occupied by the Japanese from 1942 to 1943. An American invasion drove the Japanese from <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION>, and they abandoned <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION> a short time later. No battles were fought on Buldir, which became the site of a 12-man <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military weather station.

 All 84 designs submitted for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 1988 Olympic coin will be among the displays this week at the American <ORGANIZATION> Numismatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s convention. The entries were submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials by the staff of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and nine outside artists, convention officials said. Mint sculptors had the winning entries for two of the four sides of the gold and silver coins. The five-day convention begins Wednesday, and is expected to draw 15,000 people, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muehleisen </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the coin association, said. The convention offers coin collectors an opportunity for buying and trading, as well as educational sidelights. One display will be on the scarcity of pocket change during the Civil War. A Liberty bust by <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chief sculptor and engraver for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mint, was picked for the obverse of the $ 5 gold 1988 Olympic commemorative coin. An eternal flame design by <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> is on the back of the gold. The $ 1 silver coin's obverse, which shows the Olympic flame passing between two torches, is by <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. Mint sculptor-engraver Sherl J. Winter submitted the winning reverse design for the silver _ five Olympic circles in a wreath.

<TEXT>
 A man convicted in the `` Trailside Slayings'' was sentenced to death for the second time Tuesday for murdering five hikers in 1980. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, 58, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, had already been sentenced to death for murdering two women in 1981 in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state parks. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> on Tuesday imposed the sentence recommended June 27 by the jury that convicted <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> of first-degree murder. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> could have sentenced <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> to life in prison without parole. He refused to do so, however, after recounting <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>'s criminal history since 1960, which involves at least eight violent attacks on women `` Mr. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> is, without question, a serial killer ... and a habitual criminal likely to commit violent acts against others,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` Two previous periods of incarceration, from 1960-69 and 1970-79, had no effect on his criminal activity.'' All appeals in capital cases go directly to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> had asked that <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>'s life be spared, arguing that he committed the crimes during moments of rage arising from a lifetime of abuse and rejection. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> shot the hikers execution-style after his sexual advances were rejected, and said <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> deserved to die for the crimes. Four of the five 1980 victims were women. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> also was convicted of raping two victims and trying to rape a third during his six-week killing spree, which left many of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s popular hiking areas nearly deserted until his May 1981 arrest. His trial was moved to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> after a judge ruled extensive publicity about the case prevented him from receiving a fair trial in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Farmers Get Help from Nature; Hope for More from Washington</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, beginning a 10-state inspection of drought damage, met Tuesday with farmers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> who got some relief from nature but are hoping for more from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. As much as 2 -LCB- inches of rain fell in the two states on Monday and Tuesday. But at <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s first stop, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>'s farm near <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the cornfields were still bone dry only a half-inch below the surface. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said his department has received all the crop data required to assess requests for disaster declarations, but gave no indication what assistance would be offered. `` I do n't think it will take very long for us to do an evaluation,'' he said at Avery Sheets' farm near <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` I would say in days rather than weeks or months.'' At best, Sheets said, he may harvest 30 percent of a normal crop from the 1,000 acres he planted in corn. `` It might be just all cob and no kernels,'' he said, showing an ear to <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. While the agriculture secretary expressed concern about the plight of farmers, whose crops have withered under 100-degree temperatures and a months-long rainfall shortage, several of the farmers said interest and aid might be too late. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> `` came knowing there were n't any answers,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieman </PERSON>, a farmer from <LOCATION> Crestline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said he anticipated heavier losses than the national average. `` This has always been a reliable production area,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said, and that might account for the low percentage of farmers with federal crop insurance. The insurance is required to benefit from a disaster declaration <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> signed last week for farmers in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, who left the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to join <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s corn crop could be all but wiped out. But he said rain may help some soybean fields recover. `` We could lose two-thirds or more of our corn crop,'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing the rain can do, except maybe for the soybeans.'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> is also visiting farms in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Growers of hybrid corn for seed will have the option of planting their crop and not have it counted as a feed grain under 1988 acreage programs, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the hybrid seed corn may not be grown on acreage taken from production under 1988 programs or on land enrolled in the long-term Conservation Reserve Program. Further, the additional acreage used to produce seed will not be counted when establishing base acreages for future feed grain crops, he said. Farmers who decided to use this option will not be eligible for 1988 feed grain program benefits on the acres used for the seed crop. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the action was taken to help offset the effects of drought on seed farms and to ensure that farmers will have enough seed for 1989 plantings. The option is expected to be used primarily in southern areas where the growing season is longer. Interested producers can check with local offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for further details, he said.

 What if they gave a protest rally and nobody came? It's been happening a lot at the Democratic National Convention, where the city took over a two-acre parking lot across the street from the convention site for use by demonstrators. Demonstrators with a tub to thump are finding that causes dear to their hearts are sometimes of little interest to just about anyone else. Sometimes even the demonstrators do n't show up. Weeks before the convention, groups requesting time at the lot were assigned two-hour time slots for use of a city-provided stage and sound system. The lot holds some 35,000 people, but Alternative ` 88, an umbrella organization for a number of protest groups, went to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court just before the convention, seeking additional lots for demonstrators. They lost, and lost an appeal. Despite the court fights, many of the scheduled demonstrators are not showing up and most who appear do so to an audience of only a few spectators, many of them journalists. An Atlanta-based conservative group did n't show up Monday, nor did a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> group backing the independent presidential campaign of <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Fulani </PERSON>, who had said she would bring 10,000 supporters to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, appeared later Monday there was a crowd of only about 1,000, many of whom were part of a march organized by civil rights leader <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. That was one of the larger crowds so far to occupy the lot. LEGAL, a gay and lesbian rights organization, brought about 2,000 on Sunday. About 15 people, easily half of them journalists, turned out Tuesday morning to watch <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Delguardio </PERSON>, complete with judicial robes, stage a `` trial'' of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. About a dozen onlookers and reporters watched when the family of <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> took the podium to urge that he be released from a jail in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. He has been accused of trying to export parrots illegally from that west African nation. Several other groups drew tiny crowds and often were outnumbered by police assigned to the sweltering lot to ensure order. There have been minor face-offs between demonstrators and police at the lot, and a demonstration by white supremacists was called off by the city when the marchers were outnumbered by angry counter-demonstrators. Police also canceled the group's rally on the steps of the Capitol, saying they wanted to avoid possible bloodshed. Many of the larger demonstrations have taken place away from the designated demonstration area. Police arrested 134 anti-abortion protesters at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> SurgiCenter about two miles from the convention hall on Tuesday. On Monday about 1,200 protesters went through downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to protest alleged discriminatory lending policies for residents of poorer neighborhoods, but the demonstrators but did not go to the demonstration lot. Tuesday morning, when a scheduled demonstration by AIDS patients failed to materialize, one group of officers passed the time ogling a scantily clad young woman who seemed to enjoy posing in the window of the Omni Hotel across the street from the demonstration lot. `` Does n't anybody have any binoculars?'' asked one. `` The ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is never around when you need them.''

<TEXT>
 The federal government contended Tuesday that foreign policy and national security interests require a <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> employee who wrote an article critical of the agency to submit the article to a censor before publication. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, told a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-publication regulations are designed to help keep employees from violating the law. `` Substantial foreign policy and national security interests support the pre-publication regulations,'' he told the court. `` Such activity -LRB- writing an unauthorized article -RRB- could jeopardize security, disrupt foreign relations and impair the mission of the agency.'' At issue in the case is an article written by <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> that is scheduled to appear in the September-October issue of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said in an affidavit that the article details political abuses by the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, including `` the apparent illegal use of <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> programs for covert activity.'' Ms. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON>, told the court that the regulation `` is too broad ... goes too far.'' `` Ms. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> is a part-time worker ... a script writer ... for the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>. She does n't deal with secrets.'' he said. `` What they -LRB- the government -RRB- want to do is take regulations that cover the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, expand the coverage and apply them to all employees who work in anything to do with foreign policy.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> took the case under advisement. He said, however, he could not guarantee he would make a decision on issuing a preliminary injunction declaring the regulations unconstitutional in time for Ms. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> to make her deadline of July 20 with the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohn </PERSON> said afterward that if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rules against Ms. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, he would seek an expedited review before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> challenged the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rules after she was ordered to submit the article to a censor. Under <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulations that also apply to the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, employees of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> are required to submit their writings, speeches or teaching materials `` on matters of official concern'' for clearance prior to publication. According to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manual </ORGANIZATION>, an employee's work can be denied clearance if it discloses classified information or is inaccurate or `` inconsistent with current foreign policy or can reasonably be expected to affect adversely <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign relations.''

 Armed with data which may change national estimates of the scope of the AIDS epidemic, city health officials said Tuesday that 200,000 residents are infected with the virus _ half as many as they had estimated earlier. However, city Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said the lower figure does not mean there will be fewer AIDS cases than had been projected. And he said there should be no reduction in funding to fight the disease. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said he informed the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> of the city's revision Tuesday morning. `` Since <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> represents 23 percent of the AIDS cases nationally, if they accept our methodology it will make some changes in their estimates.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, which based its estimates on the same data used previously by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, estimates that 1 million to 1.5 million Americans are infected with the HIV virus. `` It's really too early to tell if it will affect our figures,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallis </PERSON>. `` At this point, we're sticking with what we originally said.'' The revision in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> estimates came just two months after the city released a five-year master plan based on the old figure. The city plans to spend $ 334 million in AIDS prevention, education and services this year. `` It would really be a mistake for anybody or any group to take these figures and say because of that we can do less or because of that we can do differently,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The new estimate today will not affect at all expenditures either in prevention or in services,'' he said. The city estimates there will be 43,000 AIDS cases in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by 1991. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said that figure was `` based on trends of past and current AIDS cases which we are quite confident are accurate.'' The same can not be said of the number of people infected with the HIV, or human immuno-deficiency virus. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said that figure always has been `` just an estimate ... and one that at times varies widely.'' The new figure for the number of New Yorkers believed to be infected with HIV is based on recent studies in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on the number of HIV-infected homosexuals there. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said it is assumed that the rate of infection is similar in the two cities. There are 7,499 gay men in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with AIDS and 4,071 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Using that ratio and data that estimates there are 27,517 homosexual and bisexual men infected with the HIV virus in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, officials theorize there are an estimated 50,000 HIV-infected gay men in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, rather than the previously estimated 200,000 to 250,000. The number is significant because most health officials now agree that nearly all of those carrying the HIV virus will get AIDS. The higher figures, which the city has been using for nearly three years, are based on decades-old data from the reserach of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> that estimated that one out of 10 men engaged in homosexual behavior, and on sample surveys indicating that there was a 50 percent HIV infection rate among homosexual men. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> data were considered more valid than old data because `` they are based on a much smaller, tighter, more homogeneous situation.'' In addition, he said, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is `` further ahead in seroprevalence data than anywhere else in the country.'' Seroprevalence data is based on blood tests that accurately show how many people are infected with the HIV virus. The number of intravenous drug users believed to be carrying the HIV virus is unchanged. `` We continue to estimate approximately 100,000 HIV-infected people among the city's approximately 200,000 IV drug users,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Judges Say Machine Results Illegal; 1,200 Drunk-Driving Cases
Imperiled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judicial panel invalidated the results of five alcohol breath-testing machines, casting doubt on more than 1,200 drunken driving arrests made over the last two years. <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s six traffic judges ruled Monday that a state agency violated the law by not testing and re-certifying the machines after they were sent back to the manufacturer for modifications two years ago. About 4,400 people have been arrested on drunken driving charges in the county in each of the last two years, but the unusual mass challenge by defense lawyers only covered undecided cases. Prosecutors and defense attorneys disagree on how much the ruling will hurt the more than 1,200 outstanding cases. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had said earlier that the state could use other evidence such as videotapes, field sobriety tests and officers' testimony in many of the cases. But <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>, one of two defense attorneys to argue the case last week, said the machines were crucial to most cases. `` Unless a guy is falling-down drunk on a videotape, they -LRB- the prosecution -RRB- are hurting,'' he said. `` It's one of their big pieces of evidence.'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> predicted the state would be forced to allow many defendants to plead guilty to reduced reckless driving charges, or that many more cases would go to trial. Sheriff's attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Vose </PERSON> said he did not expect the sheriff's office to stop using the machines. `` I would expect that we would keep testing and ask the state to expedite its certification procedure,'' he said. But <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> said, `` If they go out tonight and start testing people, it's unapproved.'' The state Health and <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> certified the Intoxilyzer 5000 machine for use in 1984, according to testimony at last week's hearing. About 60 are in use around the state, and similar challenges have been filed in other counties. However, the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ruling is not binding on cases in other counties.

 The Democratic National Convention was supposed to open early Tuesday to allow for protracted debate on the platform. But when the starting time came, the speakers were n't there As a result, the session opened only four minutes ahead of schedule, at 4:11 p.m. `` Unfortunately, some of those members who desire and deserve be heard on these issues have not been able to arrive at this time,'' said chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> at 3 p.m. In the next hour, he suggested twice that anyone who wanted to address platform issues could come up to the podium microphone and do so. Nobody took him up on it. He assured the convention that there would be no vote before the original starting time, so that no advocate could steal a march on opponents. Convention officials, with the concurrence of the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps, had decided earlier in the day to open at 3 p.m. to accommodate what <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called `` an ad hoc discussion.'' The hall was only one-third full when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made his first announcement. By starting time, about three-fourths of the delegates were in their seats.

 Vapors from chemicals being used in a furniture refinishing project caused the fire that gutted two office suites in the 38-story <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building, fire officials said Tuesday. `` It was accidental,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` Chemical vapors made contact with an electrical outlet,'' causing a flash fire. Monday night's blaze was a haunting reminder of the May 4 fire that killed one man and ravaged five floors of the city's tallest building, the 62-story <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building. There were no deaths in the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> fire, but two of the 150 firefighters called to battle flames on the 34th and 35th floors were treated by paramedics for exhaustion and heat. A worker who was refinishing a bookcase on the 34th floor sustained minor burns, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>. The flames destroyed two office suites and caused slight damage to the surrounding area, causing $ 500,000 damage, officials said. Officials said lessons learned in fighting the earlier fire helped fight Monday night's blaze, even though the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building, like <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION>, has no fire extinguishers. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said the fire was put out in less than 45 minutes because the alarm was sounded quickly. Also, water was available and better communications were set up. In the First Interstate fire, radios between fire floors and command officials outside failed to work, but new, more powerful radios prevented a communication problem Monday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> blaze gave new impetus to the move to hasten implementation of a law requiring sprinklers in high-rises. The Union Bank tower was built in 1966, prior to the 1974 city ordinance requiring sprinklers. Last Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted to mandate sprinklers within four years in 343 pre-1974 high-rises, and sprinklers were actually in the process of being installed at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is unconscionable to build high-rises without sprinklers in them,'' Councilman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Braude </PERSON> said after the Monday blaze. Councilman <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> agreed, saying `` dragging our feet has already caused two major fires in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>'' Eighty-three people in the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> building escaped down stairwells. Most tenants were back inside on Tuesday and operations were described as normal by bank officials. `` I was jumping three steps at a time,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, an asbestos removal worker who was on the 28th floor when he heard an evacuation call over the building intercom. `` A few people were following and some stumbled and fell. I was on the 16th floor when I saw firefighters coming up the stairs.'' Firefighters lugged hoses and others carried equipment weighing up to 100 pounds up 34 flights of stairs. At midnight, the building changed ownership: <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> tower became property of <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which acquired <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 750 million transaction.

 Dozens of vendors who paid up to $ 1,500 for booths at the Democratic National Convention held a news conference Tuesday to protest their locations in an exhibit hall far away from foot traffic in the World Congress Center. `` We were told 40,000 to 50,000 people would be coming downstairs. They do n't even know we're here,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> physician trying to sell copies of a book she wrote about drug abuse. She and others demanded refunds and said they should be moved to high-traffic areas in other parts of the sprawling complex across from The Omni convention hall. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, marketing manager of the convention, said vendors would be offered full refunds if they wanted to leave or 50 percent refunds if they wanted to move to a more centrally located ballroom. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, president of a <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, company called Financial Innovations, said there were about 180 booths at the convention, with some companies operating more than one. Licenses cost from $ 750 to $ 1,500 per booth. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said he `` never made any guarantees about how many people'' would find their way to exhibit hall, which is in the basement of the building in a different wing from the press and Democratic party operations. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the convention, issued a statement saying the party would try to encourage delegates and guests to purchase souvenirs from small-business vendors in the exhibit hall. `` The party will do everything possible to publicize their location and also relocate some vendors to areas ... that are heavily trafficked,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, who did n't identify himself, told the protesting vendors he was sure other <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> members would sympathize with their plight. `` I knew you were there _ it took me over an hour to find you last night,'' he said. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said she had sold three copies of `` The Cracked Pipe,'' her book, at $ 5 apiece, since the convention began. `` It cost me $ 500 to get them printed,'' she said. The vendors said they were losing up to $ 1,000 a day in expenses and charged that <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, who gets a cut of whatever they make, set aside 10 souvenir booths for himself in the most heavily traveled part of the World Congress Center. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> said those booths are operated jointly by his company and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'88, the city's convention host committee. `` We have always told everyone that we would have official booths at the congress center and around town,'' he said. A labor dispute may be an embarrassment to the Democrats, but at least one vendor said she disagreed with a protestor's threats to vote Republican this fall. `` It would n't make me vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said cartoonist <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Denison </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` That would be a little drastic.''

<TEXT>
 Afghan guerrillas fired 15 rockets into a residential area of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Tuesday, killing 11 people, wounding 23 and destroying several homes, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s state radio reported. Before the report Tuesday, the Communist government of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said 165 rockets had hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other cities since May 15, when Soviet troops began withdrawing under an agreement mediated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Most attacks have been aimed at the capital, where the government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said rockets killed 20 people Friday. Moslem guerrillas began fighting in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a Communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December 1979. Under the April 14 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, the estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989. The insurgents, most of whom are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, deny firing rockets into residential areas. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, a commander with the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group led by <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON>, said their targets in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> are military installations, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> and the airport. <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> claimed most rockets that hit civilians are fired by the Soviets or government forces in an attempt to discredit the insurgents. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> radio said the government had lodged its 53rd complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer team, accusing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s eastern neighbor, of violating the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord More than 5 million Afghans _ about one-third of the population _ have fled their country in a decade of civil war. At least 3 million live in camps and cities along the frontier with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signed the agreement. It is guaranteed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which supports the insurgents. The guerrillas were not a party to it and have continued fighting. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said recent bombing raids by the Afghan air force in the south killed 70 villagers and 16 insurgents. They reported heavy fighting in the <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> area of southern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and said guerrillas claimed to have overrun the garrison town of <LOCATION> Shahr-i-Safa </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> on the strategic highway to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, last Friday. The diplomats gave these reports of activity in eastern <LOCATION> Aghanistan </LOCATION>: No supply convoys have reached the besieged city of <LOCATION> Asmar </LOCATION> in the northeastern <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> province since one got through in mid-June from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 70 miles to the south. Most civilians have abandoned the <LOCATION> Asmar </LOCATION> area at the northern edge of the <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, scene of heavy fighting in July, and the provincial capital <LOCATION> Asadabad </LOCATION>, 18 miles to the south, may fall soon. Guerrilla positions in the mountains above the <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> make resupply by air difficult and soldiers in <LOCATION> Urgun </LOCATION>, 18 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, receive air drops only at night. The same system is used at the besieged city of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION> province.

 The Democratic National Convention was supposed to open early Tuesday to allow for protracted debate on the platform. But when the starting time came, the speakers were n't there As a result, the session opened only four minutes ahead of schedule, at 4:11 p.m. `` Unfortunately, some of those members who desire and deserve be heard on these issues have not been able to arrive at this time,'' said chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> at 3 p.m. In the next hour, he suggested twice that anyone who wanted to address platform issues could come up to the podium microphone and do so. Nobody took him up on it. He assured the convention that there would be no vote before the original starting time, so that no advocate could steal a march on opponents. Convention officials, with the concurrence of the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps, had decided earlier in the day to open at 3 p.m. to accommodate what <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called `` an ad hoc discussion.'' The hall was only one-third full when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made his first announcement. By starting time, about three-fourths of the delegates were in their seats.

 Searchers found no sign of eight missing <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter crew members on Tuesday, more than 24 hours after their <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dragon </ORGANIZATION> crashed outside the Golden Gate. A five-member investigation board began going over pieces from the MH-53E Sea Dragon, which went down during a mine-sweeping exercise on Monday. The wreckage was recovered by <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters searching for debris and survivors, though officials said there was virtually no hope left for the crew. `` Yesterday -LRB- Monday -RRB- afternoon they were searching about 10 square miles, and today they'll expand the search, going farther out because of the wind and currents,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Petty Officer <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderton </PERSON>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it expected to find no survivors, <PERSON> Anderton </PERSON> said the search would continue as long as there was a chance anyone was alive. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> divers were preparing to explore the chilly, 60-foot-deep water 11 miles west of the Golden Gate for wreckage of the helicopter, one of four MH-53E aircraft based at the <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> on the east side of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The aircraft is a mine-sweeping version of the CH-53E Super Stallion, a cargo and troop-carrying chopper that twice has been the object of congressional inquiries. Twenty servicemen have died in previous crashes of CH-53E copters, according to <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightbody </PERSON>, editorial director for <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Images </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Franecke </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer representing families of service people killed in crashes of the 53E helicopters, said in Tuesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> that family members have told him crewmen are often asked to sign legal waivers `` before they go up.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the allegation was `` absolutely false.'' Lt. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> also said crewmen are not asked to sign waivers before going up in any kind of helicopter. Lt. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerstens </PERSON>, a spokewoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, which also uses 53E helicopters, said there was no such requirement. The captain of the salmon-fishing boat Lovely <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> said he heard two distinct explosions several moments after he saw three puffs of smoke rise over the fog bank. `` There was a tremendous explosion. There were a lot of pieces of the helicopter ... pontoons, wheels, all kinds of things floating around. It was total annihilation,'' skipper <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rescino </PERSON> said. The captain of another fishing boat, Northern Light, said the noises did n't sound like a fire or fuel explosion. `` It sounded like it hit and bounced and then hit again,'' said skipper <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskela </PERSON>. `` I called it impact, it was n't an explosion. Like wood hitting water, just magnified.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Valente </PERSON> would not confirm or deny whether there were explosions, saying it could be detrimental to the investigation. In February 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> grounded all CH-53E and MH-53E helicopters. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said all those models were inspected because of problems with part of the power train and then returned to operation. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the helicopters, described as the largest in the Western world, did not have an `` abnormally high'' accident record. The <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, using documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, reported in 1987 that in its first five years of service, the CH-53E had the worst safety record of any helicopter in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Last May, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> began a special inquiry into the aircraft at the request of Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Badham </PERSON>, R-Calif. <PERSON> Badham </PERSON> said Monday the investigation showed `` there is no inherent design or mechanical flaw in the manufacture or design. The investigation found that the accidents were caused by pilot error or a broken piece of equipment not common to the crashes, <PERSON> Badham </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bank Group Says It Supports Drought-Aid Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A major association of country banks said Tuesday it supports drought-aid legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would pour up to $ 7 billion into stricken areas to help farmers recover from crop and livestock losses. The <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which says that half its members are agricultural banks, sent letters to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> agricultural committees in support of bills awaiting final action when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns to work on July 26. A version approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee would provide payments of up to $ 100,000 to drought-stricken farmers. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has indicated he would sign such legislation. Association President-elect <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said a special committee concluded that `` the legislation deserves our full support and prompt enactment.'' The legislation would replace a major portion of the income lost by crop farmers in 1988 due to heat and drought by reallocating money that would otherwise have gone to farmers as `` deficiency'' payments to compensate them for low commodity prices. Drought has cut production and forced up prices, meaning the payments will be less. Thus, the `` savings'' would be used to finance the drought benefits. In addition, livestock, dairy and poultry producers would be provided financial aid to help cover higher feed costs and help them keep their foundation stock.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The stepfather of a man accused of four murders said the family tried to have <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> committed to a mental hospital, but were told by a sheriff's officer to wait until Monday `` It seems to me, Monday was a little bit late,'' said <PERSON> Garris </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. His stepson, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, is accused of killing four people and wounding five others in a roaming, 12-minute shooting spree on Sunday. So far, <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Sheriff <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> refused comment Tuesday, pending completion of the investigation. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> was shot and critically wounded after allegedly opening fire on sheriff's deputies. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said Monday that family members also tried to have <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> committed when he was taken to a hospital earlier Saturday. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> reportedly injured his hand beating a wall. However, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollman </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that there was no apparent effort to seek involuntary commitment for <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rollman </PERSON> said he interviewed all medical personnel who came in contact with <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> and his stepfather Saturday night. <PERSON> Rollman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> came to the hospital Saturday night with a finger injury on the left hand. About an hour later, <PERSON> Rollman </PERSON> said, `` he left the emergency room against medical advice and without getting his finger treated. There was no indication in the record that anything was said about having the man committed. `` It is routine for us in the course of a year to have people come in and say they need to have someone committed on an involuntary basis,'' <PERSON> Rollman </PERSON> said. Friends and family of <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> told The Dispatch of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> that his behavior had changed drastically several days before the shootings. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who had been living in a trailer, had financial and personal troubles, friends told the newspaper. He moved into his moped shop about a week ago after he and his wife, who is nine months pregnant, separated. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> WSJS-WTQR </ORGANIZATION> radio on Monday that he had told hospital workers Saturday that <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> had `` cracked up and lost it,'' but they declined to commit him. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he also talked to a lieutenant at the <ORGANIZATION> Forsyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday morning, and was told the commitment process would take eight hours. The lieutenant told <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>' family members that the commitment could wait until Monday, according to <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rollman </PERSON> said to begin the process for involuntary commitment, a person would undergo a psychiatric examination, followed by paperwork detailing the results. A clerk of court would review and then sign papers if commitment was deemed appropriate. Sheriff's deputies would pick up the person to be committed and take him to the specific facility, <PERSON> Rollman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, who was shot six times in the back, groin and leg, was listed in critical condition Tuesday. A hospital spokesman said the chances for his recovery was good. The dead were <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Susan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cantrell </ORGANIZATION>, 16, of <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oldham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> was not a relative of <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>.

 A Lebanese man on trial for the 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner refused to say Tuesday if bombs seized during his arrest were for terrorist attacks and instead denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s rambling denunciation was interrupted by Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON>, who adjourned the session. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, in a loud, agitated voice, said he would no longer take part in his trial. The hijackers seized the plane in June 1985, held 39 Americans captive in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for 17 days, and killed <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Scheduled to testify Wednesday is <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, who was convicted of kidnapping two West Germans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested Jan. 26, 1987 at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after returning to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> following the kidnappings of West Germans <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was freed in September, but <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> remains a hostage. As the trial entered its third week, court officials questioned <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> about a telephone notebook found on him when he was arrested also at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Jan. 13, 1987. The officials said one of the names in the notebook sounded similar to one of the other three alleged hijackers. <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> indicated without elaboration that some of the names may have a connection to bombs or bombings in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The court also heard testimony from two customs officials and three police experts, who described the explosives found in <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s baggage when he was arrested in a random check. As the day's session neared its scheduled end, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> asked that he be allowed to read a statement which he said would explain his motives for smuggling explosives into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It was an evil deed and I condemn it,'' he said, speaking in Arabic through an interpreter. `` I condemn the link brought in this court of these explosives with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' Under questioning, he refused to say if he knew whether the explosives he was carrying were to be used in terrorist attacks. Then <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> began to give a rambling condemnation of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, mentioning what he called the `` interference of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for many years,'' and citing <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. At that point, <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> interrupted <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, saying: `` The court is not the place to hear world history.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s defense lawyers objected and the judge allowed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> to continue. Reading loudly from a written statement, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> went on to call the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s greatest ally, `` whose military and political support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is growing.'' He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` killed tens of thousands of my Lebanese countrymen and destroyed hundreds of homes.'' After <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> began to criticize the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for shooting down an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, the judge again interrupted, saying he wanted to adjourn the trial. `` I see that it is forbidden for me to read my statement. I see that I am being treated as a criminal and not as political ...'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said, breaking off the sentence as the judge formally closed the session. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, speaking in a very agitated voice, then said he would refuse to give any more testimony. Earlier Tuesday, lawyer <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, chief flight attendant <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON>, and flight engineer <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, had joined in the prosecution. None of the three was present Tuesday. The procedure is common practice in West German criminal trials. Those permitted to intervene in the case are allowed to ask questions during the trial and raise objections, much the same as prosecutors. The procedure also gives them the right to appeal if they are unsatisfied with the verdict. Miss <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> is credited with preventing any more passengers from being killed by talking to the hijackers and diverting their attention. <PERSON> Hamm </PERSON> is representing 11 Americans, including <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s parents and former hostages, who have joined in the prosecution.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 84-year-old mother and Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, the oldest member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, led senior citizens in a rally Tuesday for long-term health-care legislation that Pepper promises to make a national campaign issue. `` Unfortunately, our present administration has wanted to do as little with government applied to people's needs as possible. That is not what <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is going to do,'' said <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who said she had required home care three times herself, predicted that if her son is elected president he would push for passage of legislation for long-term care, sponsored by Pepper, that failed in the House this year. Pepper, 87, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Democrat who's attending his 13th convention _ he gave a nominating speech for <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> at the 1940 national convention _ recounted how his bill was defeated because of concerns over its costs and a jurisidictional battle among committee chairmen. `` Of course, they're going to have answer to the people this fall, those who voted callously against the needy <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said Pepper. He has no opposition for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> this year and plans to campaign nationally for his health-care bill. The bill, estimated to cost $ 27 billion in its first five years, would provide federally assisted home health care to the chronically ill of all ages. It would be funded by requiring about 8 million workers who make more than $ 45,000 a year to pay <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> taxes on all their wages _ not just the first $ 45,000, as under present law. Accompanying Pepper and Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the news conference were two 5-year-old <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> children who would benefit from such legislation. They were <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, who has been comatose since nearly drowning more than a year ago, and <PERSON> Coley </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who suffered brain damage in a near-drowning two years ago. `` I ca n't believe the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is unconcerned about these children,'' <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a passionate advocate of aid to refugees, told Asian-American delegates Tuesday that she and her husband would continue those efforts in the White House. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is committed to opportunity for all Americans,'' the wife of the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be said in brief remarks at a brunch near the hall where Democrats are holding their national convention. `` When our ancestors, like many of yours, arrived in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, this country gave them something and they in return gave back,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. She gave an emotional description of her several visits to refugee camps along the Thailand-Cambodia border, including a 1985 trip after which she won the release of a young boy whose sister lived in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The boy, <PERSON> Hout </PERSON> <PERSON> Pich </PERSON>, graduated from high school last month and is headed to <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on a full scholarship in the fall, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Whatever happiness I hear about <PERSON> Hout </PERSON> <PERSON> Pich </PERSON>, I have a sense of sadness for the thousands of others like <PERSON> Pich </PERSON> who are suffering,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` None of us can rest until they have the opportunity to fulfill their dreams.'' Two Asian-American congressman at the brunch, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, praised Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for her refugee work and urged the delegates to work for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in November. <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> said polls have shown <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and designated running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in a position to defeat Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the key states of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Those states, he said, also have the four largest Asian-American populations in the country. `` The Asian-American community will be tested in this election,'' <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> said. `` You may help make the difference in this election. You may help elect the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 A charge of criminal homicide was lodged Tuesday against a small town bookstore operator already charged with kidnapping and related counts in the abduction and slaying of a banker's wife. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copenhefer </PERSON>, 41, of <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> was arraigned before Erie County Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfadt </PERSON>. Copenhefer is accused of abducting <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> on June 17, trying to extort money from her husband, <LOCATION> Pennbank </LOCATION> branch manager <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>, then shooting the woman in the back of the head. Mrs. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON>'s body was found June 19 in a field outside <PERSON> Corry </PERSON> in northwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Copenhefer </PERSON> was charged with kidnapping the following day. The criminal homicide charge was delayed while investigators conducted ballistics tests and developed other evidence. At a news conference, state police said they have not ruled out the possibility others were involved in the abduction. An affidavit distributed by District Attorney <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> says the evidence against <PERSON> Copenhefer </PERSON> includes a handwritten version of a computer-generated extortion note left for <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> to retrieve.

<TEXT>
 The Democratic National Convention was supposed to open early Tuesday to allow for protracted debate on the platform. But when the starting time came, the speakers were n't there As a result, the session opened only four minutes ahead of schedule, at 4:11 p.m. `` Unfortunately, some of those members who desire and deserve be heard on these issues have not been able to arrive at this time,'' said chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> at 3 p.m. In the next hour, he suggested twice that anyone who wanted to address platform issues could come up to the podium microphone and do so. Nobody took him up on it. He assured the convention that there would be no vote before the original starting time, so that no advocate could steal a march on opponents. Convention officials, with the concurrence of the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camps, had decided earlier in the day to open at 3 p.m. to accommodate what <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called `` an ad hoc discussion.'' The hall was only one-third full when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made his first announcement. By starting time, about three-fourths of the delegates were in their seats.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> officials are in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> inspecting nuclear missile sites in compliance with the superpowers' Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday ADN, in a brief report, said that two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection teams arrived in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Monday. One team began checking a missile site near the town of <LOCATION> Waren </LOCATION>, about 70 miles north of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> the same day. The East German news agency also said the other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection team started checking a second site Tuesday at <LOCATION> Koenigsbrueck </LOCATION>, about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. According to ADN, the Soviets maintained missiles at the sites until February, when they decided to remove them early to set a positive example in nuclear disarmament. The inspections in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> come as two teams of Soviet inspectors checked nuclear missile sites in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which also fall under the INF agreement. Soviet teams have already conducted inspections at missile sites in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this month, at the same time <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection teams began deploying to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact locations. The inspections fall under the terms of the INF treaty signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last Dec. 8 by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The treaty provides for the elimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with ranges from 340 miles to 3,000 miles.

 The next president likely will face `` accelerating deterioration'' of stability in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unless <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy-makers find a consensus on helping the Nicaraguan rebels, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser said Tuesday. In a rare speaking appearance, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told a foreign affairs audience that the battle over Nicaraguan policy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is reminiscent of divisiveness in the Vietnam War era. He called <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` an area of latent crisis.'' In a speech to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said that `` when we are united _ as we have been in support of the Afghan freedom fighters, or of a solid <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, or of a new basis for U.S.-Soviet relations, or of a vital commitment in the -LRB- Persian -RRB- gulf, we can achieve a great deal.'' `` But recent history also teaches that when we are divided over tactics _ as in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ our policy suffers grievously and our national interest does too,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. In answering questions after his speech, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said that he is encouraged by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s announcement Monday that it would accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` It is a breakthrough, in my judgment, but it is only a first step,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said in answer to questions from the council. `` The war goes on. It goes on right now, today.'' Asked if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval presence would be withdrawn from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> if the cease-fire does stick, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said it did not. `` We have had vessels in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since 1949,'' he said. `` Because of the importance of that waterway and because of our strategic interest in the region, I do not see us ever removing our forces from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.'' He added that if there were no longer threats to neutral shipping in the gulf, `` we could review our force structure and adjust it accordingly.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s comments on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> came in the wake of actions by Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> to consolidate leadership of the Contra rebel force, and renewed diplomatic tensions between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, who have expelled several of each other's envoys The administration has signaled that it supports a bill introduced by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., which, among other things, would include $ 20 million in military assistance to be held in escrow for the president's use against the Sandinista regime in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> In his speech, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said that `` unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president ... come to agreement on a program of effective aid for the Nicaraguan resistance as an adjunct to our diplomatic strategy, the next president will probably face a situation of accelerating deterioration, as all the local democracies will come under growing strains as <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> grows stronger, more assertive and more aggressive.'' `` Last week, you all saw the reaction of the Sandinista regime to legitimate political protest,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, referring to the shutdowns of a newspaper and radio station and the expulsion of American Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, who was accused of engaging in activities undermining the state. `` Can there be any further doubt about the totalitarian nature of the ruling junta in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> asked. On other subjects, the national security adviser said: _ The administration has recovered from the `` aberration of Iran-Contra. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said administration officials are working harder to keep members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> informed of sensitive national security matters. _ He plans to return to active duty in the Army when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term ends next `` I expect to go back to a nice quiet foxhole where I can serve my country in a more comfortable and perhaps less exposed position,'' he said. _ The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` clearly do not want to see a repetition of the period of military weakness that we went through in the wake of the Vietnam War.

 A Soviet official said on Tuesday that inspections in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> show a superpower treaty scrapping intermediate-range nuclear missiles is being implemented without cheating. <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebedev </PERSON> made the remark after he and 19 other Soviet inspectors landed at this air force base to start counting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in accordance with the treaty. The Soviet inspectors arrived at <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Common </LOCATION>, 50 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, aboard a blue-and-white <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilyushin </ORGANIZATION> jet. They were welcomed by a delegation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British officers. <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common is one of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missile bases in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The other is at <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Both bases are run by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> personnel, but are technically <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases. The base has 96 operational missiles and five back-up missiles, while there are another 16 operational missiles at <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military says. <PERSON> Lebedev </PERSON> said that, based on similar inspections this month in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, no one seemed to be cheating on the terms of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Dec. 8 by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The experience of the inspections has shown that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strictly implemented the treaty signed by them and the first steps as to its realization are successful,'' said <PERSON> Lebedev </PERSON>. Soviet inspectors arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> July 16 to inspect some of the 14 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile sites, training facilities and industrial plants. These include <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, which has 37 <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles and <ORGANIZATION> Redstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> that manages the Pershing 1A and <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 nuclear missile programs. The treaty provides for the elimination within three years of all nuclear missiles with ranges of 340 miles to 3,000 miles and includes stringent inspection provisions to guard against cheating. At <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common, a customs and immigration post was set up to receive the Soviets and check the cameras, <PERSON> Geiger </PERSON> counters and other equipment they were allowed to bring for the inspection. They are to stay at the base overnight in converted servicemen's accommodations, and are to eat meals at a cafeteria on the base Under the treaty, the inspectors may check the missiles and their 55-foot mobile launchers _ which are to be taken back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and destroyed _ but not the warheads. The Soviets were to declare Wednesday exactly what they want to see at the bases. They may also place security men at all entry and exit roads to ensure no missiles are surreptitiously moved out, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're entirely in the Soviets' hands,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. `` They will say where they want to go.'' The inspectors, who will be flown to <LOCATION> Molesworth </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Greenham </LOCATION> Common, will not be allowed to step outside the bases during their stay, which is expected to last up to 4 -LCB- days, or until the inspection is completed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers, mostly from an on-site inspection agency based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, will accompany the Soviets as they examine the missiles and launchers. Soviet inspectors first checked missiles in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on July 1 at two West German sites housing Pershing-2 rockets. The current inspections are part of a 60-day period of `` baseline inspections'' to determine the accuracy of data exchanged by the two sides. The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors are visiting 133 Soviet sites. So far, no violations have been discovered, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say, and the inspections are about 25 percent complete. The Soviets notified the British of their visit on Monday, officials said, under the 16-hour notice-of-inspection rule. In November 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Greenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> was the first Western European base to accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruise missiles under a December 1979 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance accord.

 <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> delegates to the Democratic National Convention shrugged off a Tuesday visit by extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, with one terming his presentation `` a very mild speech _ mild for him.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, said delegation leaders had been asked to allow <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s views to be put before the caucus and had agreed. `` We were all waiting for some representative to come in, and he came in himself,'' <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said. Members of the group said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who was sporting a beard, spoke for less than five minutes and left after receiving little response. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> warned delegates that `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s headed for another depression,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Meserve </PERSON>, the local president of striking paperworkers at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` They let him talk and get out.'' <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said the reaction among <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrats ranged from bemusement to shock. `` Everybody's jaw sort of dropped,'' he said. Another <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> delegate, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, the speaker of the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, said he had heard of similar requests made of other delegations, but knew of no other appearances by <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> himself. `` Other states just flatly refused to let him speak,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, `` but we're open. And he came and he spoke and he left.'' <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, who is running for president, espouses a variety of bizarre views, advocating an effort to start settlements on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and accusing the Queen of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> of drug trafficking. He, along with six aides and five <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> organizations, has been charged with conspiring to obstruct a federal grand jury investigation into allegations that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign reaped more than $ 2 million through credit card and loan fraud. They went on trial in December 1887, but a mistrial was declared in May in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Prosecutors want to retry the case.

In all, 275 subpoenas, mostly for documents and records, were due to be answered in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibbley </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, said the government had arranged a location, which she would not identify, where lawyers and those under subpoena could deliver records without being observed by reporters. Many of the subpoenas are to persons who are only potential witnesses in the investigation and not targets of it. Ms. <PERSON> Dibbley </PERSON> had no comment on the <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> motion to quash his subpoenas and said she knew of no objections filed to the other subpoenas. The only recognizable figure to arrive for the morning session of the grand jury in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse was <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, a civilian employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> who supervised equipment purchases. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>'s office was searched by federal agents in a series of coordinated raids on June 14 which brought the nearly 2-year-old probe to public attention. No one has been charged yet in the probe of the $ 150-billion-a-year Pentagon purchasing system. But government documents show that investigators are looking allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them former military men, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, who has been transferred to other duties pending the outcome of the investigation, was a supervisory negotiator for the contracts division of installation and logistics office of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. He has been a civilian employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> since 1971 and was a civilian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> employee from 1957 to 1971. According to Pentagon records, <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> is a GS-14, making between $ 46,600 and $ 60,683. Neither he nor his attorney would comment on his appearance at the courthouse. It could not be determined if he was actually brought before the grand jury. Other witnesses, however, were seen entering and leaving the grand jury room later in the day. At a lunch break, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronica </PERSON>, who is in charge of the grand jury, told reporters `` there wo n't be any luminaries'' during the first day. The grand jury is expected to be back in session Wednesday. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, said he filed a motion to quash the 11 subpoenas issued for <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who served as assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for research, engineering and systems from December 1981 to April 1987 when he became a consultant. In addition, <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said, `` We asked the government to affirm or deny whether they used illegal electronic surveillance. Even the fact that they may have gotten authorization does not mean their wiretap was applied for and carried out in a legal matter. Before we comply with a subpoena, we want to insure that the government has carried out its responsibilities under the wiretap statute in an appropriate and accurate manner.'' Earlier, the government released the search warrant for <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, which indicated that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents were investigating whether he received payments from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> while he worked for the Pentagon. The warrant also showed the government is investigating consulting work he has done since leaving the government for 10 different defense contractors. At <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said in a letter to company employees that the giant computer company, formed by the merger of <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burroughs </LOCATION>, had pledged full cooperation with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s investigation. `` We expect and encourage each of our employees also to cooperate fully in responding to the government's inquiries,'' <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> wrote. The new management was installed at the former <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION> and Fire Control Division in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said. The government searched <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION> on June 14. Federal agents also searched offices or homes of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, consultant and former general manager and vice president at the <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neck </ORGANIZATION> plant; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, administrative aide at the plant; <LOCATION> Armtec </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> company owned by consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> who retired after 30 years with <PERSON> Sperry </PERSON>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, a consultant who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> among other companies; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who also did some work for <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is reported by several newspapers to have handed checks to Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md., as campaign contributions during a tour he made of the Unisys plant a year ago Those checks and others later mailed totaled $ 14,000, the reports have said. The government has searched the offices of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Seelmeyer </PERSON>, a former congressional aide and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> air charter pilot who is reported to have arranged <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s flight to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said he was establishing a senior management approval process for all consulting agreements and congressional honoraria. He also announced the hiring of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Covington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Burling to aid the company in enforcing an ethics program introduced a year ago. `` Although our internal investigation is not concluded,'' <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said. `` to date it indicates that certain division employees and consultants appear to have had a history of engaging at <LOCATION> Sperry </LOCATION> in activities which are contrary to the policies and procedures put in place by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. These practices appear to have continued in the new company.'' The division employes 2,500 of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>' 90,000 employees and had 1987 revenue of $ 300 million with before-tax profits of $ 18 million. <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said the internal inquiry, begun without knowledge of the government's investigation, `` focused on the use of outside consultants and whether any division funds had been diverted for improper use.''

<HEAD>Milk Output Expected About 1 Percent Above Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Milk production may not increase this year as much as forecast earlier, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Tuesday. `` For all of 1988, milk production probably will total about 1 percent more than 1987's 142.5 billion pounds,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Earlier, the agency said the increase could be in the range of 1 percent to 3 percent. `` Downward pressure on milk production will intensify during the second half of 1988,'' the report said. `` Concentrate -LRB- grain -RRB- prices will be much higher, and forage costs will rise sharply in areas hit by the drought.'' Seasonal increases in milk prices will `` likely be larger'' than last year, although the average price at the farm for all of 1988 probably will be down 3 percent to 5 percent from last year's $ 12.54 per 100 pounds, the report said `` May retail prices were less than 2 percent higher than a year ago, and only half the increase for all food or all consumer items,'' the report said. `` Seasonal upswings in retail prices may be slightly larger than a year earlier during the second half of 1988. However, retail dairy prices probably will average only 1 percent to 3 percent higher for the year.''

 Leftist political leader <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON> <PERSON> Carranza </PERSON> says he has canceled his planned return to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> because of government threats that he will be arrested. <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that the threats `` clearly show the lack of guarantees in the country.'' When party leaders last week announced plans to return, Information Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viera </PERSON> told reporters that military authorities should take <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON> into custody because `` there are national and foreign press reports saying he is a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the coalition of five leftist guerrilla groups that have fought the U.S.-supported government since 1980. It is allied with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or FDR, the left's legal political umbrella organization. `` It is one thing that leaders of the FDR can enter the country to seek legitimacy and political legality and another that a member of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> wants to enter the country,'' <PERSON> Viera </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON>, interviewed Monday, denied he was ever a guerrilla commander. He helped found the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in 1980. He said one reason leaders of his <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> want to return is to reactivate its 1969 registration as a legal political party. Government officials have described his organization as a front for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aronette </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON>, a leader of the party who is in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, denied the accusation. `` That is what they have always said, but we are people of progressive thought and in our party there have been people from all the political spectrum and we do not deny there may have been someone from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Aguinada </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tirso </PERSON> <PERSON> Canales </PERSON>, who was due to arrive shortly, would work to revive the party.

 Small amounts of medical debris were found on beaches in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> on Tuesday, more than 100 miles from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shores, where larger quantities of medical waste have washed up in past weeks. The waste poses no specific health risk, officials said. But some states closed the affected beaches. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> officials said they had little doubt the needles and syringes, catheter bags, rubber tubing, and respirator parts were related to the other finds. Some waste also was found on <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> beaches last week. The waste likely is `` part of a sweeping arc of medical garbage that someone has dropped off the Eastern shore,'' said <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Health Director <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. Health officials in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> said tests revealed little health risks associated with the debris, even though a handful of vials found in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> earlier this month contained blood that tested positive for the AIDS virus. `` Aesthetically, it's a problem. Nobody wants to swim in garbage,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartter </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s epidemiology program. `` But from an epidemiological point of view, there has never been an outbreak because of disposal of infectious waste,'' he said Monday. Dr. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Debuono </PERSON>, chief of disease control for <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s health department, said Tuesday that sun and salt water should have effectively removed any infectious material from the items It's highly unlikely a person stepping on a needle would contract hepatitis or the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome, she said. Tests on three syringes found at southern <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beaches turned up no signs of blood or contaminants, the state health department said. Those beaches will stay open, officials said. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Look </PERSON>, a health official in <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard beaches would also stay open, despite discovery of some empty medical vials and several syringes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials, meanwhile, were waiting for two consecutive clean tides before lifting the swimming ban at several city beaches shut when medical waste washed ashore, said Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. About 90 items, including syringes and bottles, were found on beaches in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> city area Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, a swimming ban remained in effect for some beaches in <LOCATION> Asbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> after water samples continued to show high levels of fecal coliform bacteria, usually associated with human waste. `` It's coming from somewhere, and it's very frustrating not to know where because we're very concerned it will happen again,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON>, head of beach operations in <LOCATION> Asbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where a five-day ban on swimming was lifted Sunday on all but one beach.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The most precious commodity in a political campaign _ more than money or endorsements or straw hats with red, white and blue bunting _ is what insiders refer to as `` the body.'' This week, the body belongs to one <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. To see what the Democrats want to achieve during convention week, it's instructive to consider how the governor is spending his time here. His schedule reveals a sharp departure from the strategy of nominees past. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has junked the nominee's ritual convention-week meetings with delegates. In the past, a fellow like <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> would begin his convention day with breakfast remarks to, say, the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> delegation, and then go on to a brief appearance before, for example, the Upper Midwest Hispanic Agricultural Caucus. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> people have changed all that. The plans for Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> this week have taken the nominee out of his party's smoke-filled buffets and instead into the community for some well-publicized, and carefully considered, public events Ranging from his Sunday night family reunion at cousin <PERSON> Pano </PERSON>'s restaurant in <LOCATION> Buckhead </LOCATION> to the Monday morning unity meeting with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee-to-be is balancing political duties with the developing imagery of a common man <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' main events were plotted in advance as symbols of three issues he hopes to pursue in his fall campaign against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: His concern with drug abuse, his endorsement of plant closing legislation, and his support for civil rights enforcement. An event-a-day was scheduled to demonstrate the Democratic position on these issues. For example, on Tuesday <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> traveled over to Sweet Auburn for a tour of the Martin Luther King Center. This is a man who during his 17-month primary campaign traveled to hundreds of cities in 40-odd states, who did events morning, noon and night, and it was rare that he would make his way into the black community. Right or wrong, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> simply conceded the primary black vote to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he is conceding nothing, so there he was with <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, talking about the link between <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants and American blacks. The other major element of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' carefully crafted <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> day may be even more significant. His schedulers have allotted as much as 90 minutes a day for the governor to conduct television interviews with local TV stations around the country. This is a huge chunk of time, considering the number of party officials, fat cats and humble print journalists who would kill for a minute of the nominee's convention-week time. At the Hyatt Regency, a hotel room has been wired for video and sound; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> merely has to walk down the hall from his suite while interviewers are shuttled in and out. Of course, the best laid plans ... many of the TV interviews have been canceled as other events crowded in, and on Monday <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had to scrap a factory gate appearance to find time for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> parlay with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. And at least one special interest caucus got a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visit _ Hispanic congressmen. All business and no pleasure would make <PERSON> Mikey </PERSON> a dull boy. And so interspersed amongst his convention events, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has found time for his daily power walk -LRB- an exercise routine, no press coverage -RRB- and for late-night family dinners.

<TEXT>
 Of course <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has n't got the only body in town. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the designated running mate, has a full plate of delegation breakfasts and special interest caucuses. This is how <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s body was being deployed on Tuesday: 8 a.m. Salute to civil rights at <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. 10:20 a.m. Meet with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. 10:45 a.m. Brunch with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> delegation. 11:45 a.m. Tour Martin Luther King Center with <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. 7:30 p.m. Finance twilight supper. 9:30 p.m. Network interviews at <LOCATION> Hyatt </LOCATION>. Presumedly, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> does n't mind pulling these chores. After all, it's perfect training for the vice presidency.

<HEAD>Wage Dispute Disrupts Mine in Silesia, Inflation Hits 56 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pay dispute disrupted a coal mine's operations for two days, authorities said Tuesday, and the government said retail price inflation reached 56.7 percent in the first half of the year Wages went up even more, by 63.8 percent, said the report published in the government newspaper Rzeczpospolita. The increase would put the national average wage on July 1 at the equivalent of about $ 106 a month compared to $ 91 on Jan. 1. Workers in some plants struck in April and May for higher wages to offset 27 percent price increases imposed in February. Since then, both prices and wages have gone higher than the government had planned. Official say they want to analyze economic statistics for the first half of 1988 before starting new talks with official trade unions on adjusting wage-and-price policy. In one instance of wage pressure, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that two days of labor-management talks over pay affected output at the Boleslaw the Bold coal mine at <LOCATION> Laziszka </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. An official statement issued Tuesday after a Cabinet meeting said: `` The principal goal for next year is to be the radical reduction of inflation, which is now the most important single factor standing in the way of increasing the efficiency of industrial production in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' Next to the statement, <PERSON> Rzeczpospolita </PERSON> published an interview with government economist <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Plichcinski </PERSON>, in which he gave new inflation figures. <PERSON> Plichcinski </PERSON> said the growth of wages faster than prices has set off a `` worrying inflationary gap.'' The 56.7 percent inflation for the first six months of 1988 exceeds initial projections for the entire year. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s central annual plan projected growth in prices of 40-44 percent in 1988, with wages planned to rise 36 percent. Prices rose 42 percent in the first quarter alone. At <LOCATION> Laziszka </LOCATION>, some miners refused to work Saturday, prompting a round of talks with management that evening, and the talks continued Monday, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said 800 of 980 miners refused to work for several hours Monday. He said he had no details on the number involved Saturday. He referred reporters to the <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> report when asked if the miners received raises. The news agency said only that miners resumed work after having `` accepted explanations and information presented to them in the course of the meetings.'' A spokesman for the state mining monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the workers were promised higher pay although negotiations were still going on. Miners now earn the equivalent of $ 111 - $ 133 a month Urban also said a newspaper report on secret <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to Solidarity proves the banned trade union movement is not `` a Polish force,'' and accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of interfering in Polish affairs. A July 10 report in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has secretly supported emigre efforts to smuggle printing equipment, radio systems and video cassettes to opposition groups in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It said this was in addition to $ 2 million to Solidarity openly appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We view both these overt and covert actions by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities as a significant manifestation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> which stands in glaring contrast with the professed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> principle of non-intervention in our internal affairs,'' <PERSON> Urgban </PERSON> said. As for Solidarity, he said: `` Whoever receives a soldier's pay from an alien power can neither define itself as an independent force nor a Polish force.''

<HEAD>Seven Former Narcotics Officers Indicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal grand jury indicted seven former narcotics officers Tuesday, charging them with a racketeering conspiracy and extortion of at least $ 400,000 and large quantities of cocaine from drug dealers. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> called the latest indictments `` another sad day for the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> police department'' and said he is continuing efforts to root out corruption. But he added that the corruption involves `` only a very small and insignificant number'' of officers. `` For police officers to take money or other property in exchange for allowing drug dealers to continue to deal drugs or for the officers to take and to distribute drugs themselves, that makes other forms of official corruption pale in comparison,'' said acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> II. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> spoke at a news conference, where one of the indicted men, former Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, burst in to proclaim his innocence, saying, `` I was investigated for seven years.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents forcibly ejected him. Since a federal inquiry into official corruption here began nearly a decade ago, about 40 city police officers have been convicted, mostly for protecting illegal gambling. Six of the officers indicted Tuesday are no longer members of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s 7,000-member police department and the seventh, who had remained on th force but not in a narcotics squad, was suspended and given a dismissal notification, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Two others who were not police officers were also charged, one with conspiracy to distribute cocaine the police obtained in a narcotics search, and the other with failing to pay income taxes on drug profits. The indictment alleges the racketeering activity occurred between January 1980 and February 1984 when at least 65 narcotics searches were conducted by officers assigned to a special drug squad that has since been disbanded. The indictment charged <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Giongo </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cattalo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilt </PERSON> with obtaining money and other property, including drugs, for their personal gain by stealing, threats and intimidation, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. This pattern of activity falls under federal racketeering laws, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said, enabling the indictment to seek forfeiture to the government of about $ 400,000 in proceeds. Racketeering also carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $ 25,000 fine. Besides the racketeering charge, <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> and Cattalo are accused of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine. <PERSON> Grove </PERSON>, Cattalo, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and Hilt are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice. Another ex-member of the special drug squad, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hund </PERSON>, and civilian <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Karasinksi </PERSON> were charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, while <PERSON> Karasinksi </PERSON> also was charged with failure to file a tax return. Civilian <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> was charged with two counts of income tax evasion.

 Soviet and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizens soon will not need visas to visit each other's country for business purposes, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official announced Tuesday. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Avramenko </PERSON>, first deputy chief of the ministry's consular directorate, said the new agreement goes into effect on Aug. 14. He called it part of the `` overall Soviet-Chinese relationship.'' Soviet and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> representatives signed the agreement in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday, he told a government news briefing. The two communist giants fell out in the 1960s over ideological differences and border questions, but now are holding regular negotiations about normalizing their relations. <PERSON> Avramenko </PERSON> said that under the new regulations, `` all citizens of the two countries can go on business trips regardless of whether they have diplomat's, citizen's or businessmen's passports.'' The Soviet official said that previously, only Chinese and Soviet diplomats were authorized to visit the other country without visas. He said the new visa-free system would make it easier for members of economic cooperatives that have been created in both countries to do business together. <PERSON> Avramenko </PERSON> said the Chinese offered to sell the Soviets a consignment of watermelons last year, but the more stringent visa regulations made it `` hard to close that deal.'' The melons were finally sold, he said.

<HEAD>With AM-Mandela, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> affirmed her opposition to sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> during an exchange Tuesday in Parliament where shouting opponents labeled her a racist. `` If there were ever to be comprehensive sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the number of people who would suffer, including children, would be significantly greater,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said to the 650-member House of Commons. The exchange came in a session of the twice-weekly Question Time, where the prime minister fields questions and often insults from legislators. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said sanctions would devastate the economies of the countries near <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Those countries _ <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> _ are dependent on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to transport their goods and have not imposed economic restrictions themselves, she said. Replying to a question from opposition leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> already has invested $ 84 million in foreign aid to the surrounding states and has further plans to reduce their dependence on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said his visit to southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> last week showed him that `` strong sanctions'' were needed to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks can not vote on national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> did not visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The leaders of the front-line states call for sanctions,'' <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> told Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> amid cheers from his party and jeers from her governing Conservatives. `` Do you really think you know more about what needs to be done than those who live daily with apartheid and its oppression? This is not only a question of sense but a question of morality,'' <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said. As rank-and-file Labor legislators shouted `` racist!'' and `` Nazi!'' at Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and the Conservatives, she replied: `` I totally disagree with you about sanctions, and unlike you I'm not prepared to stand here comfortably in this house and impose starvation on millions and millions of black South Africans and black children.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> meanwhile defended the imprisonment of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, who turned 70 on Monday. Speaking to a meeting of the Diplomatic and <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Ambassador <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Killen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> could be released if he renounced violence. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> says <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> must first renounce apartheid.

 Two surviving members of a family that tried to hijack a passenger jet to the West were charged at the conclusion of an investigation into the incident in which nine people were killed, it was reported Tuesday. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovechkin </PERSON> and his sister, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>, were charged with planning and executing the March 8 hijacking during which a flight attendant and three passengers were killed, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

There were also at least four children accompanying the adults, according to earlier press reports. The hijackers seized an Aeroflot TU-154 en route from the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, via the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Kurgan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Democratic congressional leaders took shots Tuesday at Republican presidential contender <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, touted their legislative record and promised an `` all-out war'' against drugs. `` I want to show you what your <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has done, and how much more we can do with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in prepared remarks to the Democratic National Convention. Democrats have dominated <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for most of the past 35 years. They last controlled both the White House and the legislative branch in 1980. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> won the presidential election that year, and the Republicans gained control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Democrats reclaimed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> six years later. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> rattled off a list of bills enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over the past 18 months, noting that two _ the clean water act and a highway bill _ were passed over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. He also pointed to legislation to give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> workers 60 days' notice of impending plant closings, the provision which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cited in vetoing a trade bill <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> separated the plant closings from the trade bill and sent both issues back to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as separate bills. `` Before this summer ends, we shall lead a strong initiative against our most serious national problem _ illegal drugs,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, sounding a theme that has shown up in national polls as the most ripe for political appeals. `` The Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will declare an all-out war on drugs.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s response to the drug problem has been the slogan, `` Just say no,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> observed. `` It does little good ... when the administration is unwilling to say ` yes' to the funding necessary to carry on the war.'' House Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> turned his guns on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, seeking to emphasize what Democrats have come to call the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee's `` wimp factor.'' `` We're prepared to give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the licking of his political life,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said, noting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has spent most of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> week a fishing spot in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who is expected to resign later this summer to head the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, is there `` just in case <PERSON> George </PERSON> is too squeamish to bait his own hook,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. And he drew distinctions between the Democrats' Dukakis-Bentsen ticket and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy. `` It is a race between two vastly different profiles in leadership,'' he said. `` A race between a man of action and a man of absence. Between a man with a noble purpose, and a man with a noble pedigree. Between a miracle from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with a real <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accent, and a fellow who wears cowboy boots over argyle socks.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> took a more philosophical tone, asserting that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration brought `` greed and arrogance'' to government and called for a restoration of confidence. `` We must ... roll back the shadows that have gathered over this administration _ the mistrust, the arrogance, the dark dealings,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. `` National policy can not be made by wisecrack and blunder.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was ready for talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and welcomed that country's acceptance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution to end the bloody war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But he said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships would remain in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> until they were no longer needed to protect American-flag vessels and ensure freedom of navigation. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spoke near the conclusion of his last and longest trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as secretary of state. He left <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Wednesday for the new <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, completing a nine-country, 2 -LCB- - week trip through <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> At a news conference following meetings with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leaders, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said `` the relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> right now is as good, as healthy as it has ever been in my observation of it.'' On the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the increase in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strength in that region last summer was in response to attacks on international shipping as part of the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> attacks Iranian economic targets to cut off the oil exports that finance the war, and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> retaliates by raiding neutral merchant vessels. `` If the problems go away, the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military -RRB- ship presence will go down,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` Just when that will be apparent remains to be seen.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> announced Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> unconditionally accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in the war. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had accepted the resolution after it was passed in July 1987, on condition that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> did so. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains `` prepared for direct discussions with them -LRB- Iranians -RRB- on all manner of issues that concern us. We want these discussions to be on an official, authoritative basis.'' He said indirect talks had been held earlier through Swiss and other intermediaries. Asked about Japanese offers to help resolve the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> conflict, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said it was a `` very good development'' that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was becoming more involved in major international problems. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should fill civilian posts in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force if one is dispatched to the Iran-Iraq front. Japanese officials also said <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> would consider resuming development assistance to both warring nations once peace was attained. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had resolved a `` great many problems'' related to trade and other economic issues. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, he said, has agreed to remove quotas on the import of American beef and citrus products, was proceeding to provide <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> companies better access to public works projects in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and was taking steps to assume more of the cost for maintaining about 60,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in the country. The Foreign Ministry provided figures showing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had declined by 15 percent during the first half of 1988 over the previous year.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has accused a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> developer of making contributions exceeding the legal limit to the presidential campaigns of former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Commission officials filed papers in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday seeking to force <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> to comply with a subpoena and to testify about `` fund raising, contributions and other activities, commercial or otherwise.'' The election commission said <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he was questioned about the matter in April. The allegations were reported in The Washington Post in January. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said at the time that he knew nothing about illegal contributions and he directed his staff to return money improperly obtained. <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said his client should not be subject to a civil investigation by the election commission because he may be the target of a criminal inquiry by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The commission stated in its court documents that it had reason to believe <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> may have violated election laws barring contributions of more than $ 1,000 to a single candidate and limiting total individual contributions to $ 25,000. The commission contends that <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, 40, donated at least $ 38,750 for the 1980 election, of which only $ 10,000 was refunded. Among the contributions were $ 1,000 to <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s Americans With <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> committee; $ 25,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; and $ 1,000 to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dinner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, along with contributions of $ 1,000 and $ 500 to various individual candidates. The commission documents state that <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>'s efforts to `` impermissibly aid'' the <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> campaign, `` may have been coordinated with campaign personnel.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, reporting on the documents Tuesday, said <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> refused to discuss the matter with Register reporters Monday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where he is attending the Democratic National Convention as an uncommitted delegate. The court documents also link <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> video promoter <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON>, who was indicted last month by a federal grand jury on charges that he illegally donated almost $ 200,000 to candidates, including <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. Among the items <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> refused to discuss during the April questioning was the purpose of a $ 30,000 check he wrote in 1984 to <PERSON> Karl </PERSON>'s business, and what, if any, relationship the check had to the <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> campaign, the documents said. Election laws forbid corporate contributions of cash or services to campaigns. The documents also accuse <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> of buying a computer from <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s 1984 presidential campaign and leasing it back for an amount far below the market rate If the commission determines that <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> violated federal election laws, it could impose civil fines up to $ 10,000, and 20 percent of the amount involved if the violation was found to be intentional.

 <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man who was granted asylum in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, appeared on Soviet television Tuesday night and said he fled the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was hounding him. The 31-year-old defector, who worked in naval intelligence while in the service from 1975-82, appeared at ease during a taped statement at the end of the nightly news program `` Vremya.'' He gave no details of alleged <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> persecution. Soviet media said Sunday that <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> asked for and was granted asylum. The next day, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaken </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> an espionage investigation was launched against <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> before he disappeared in May 1986. `` For a long time I have served in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> said on Soviet television. He said he had recently worked in naval intelligence and had studied Russian language and literature at <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` Last year I found myself confronted with a fateful decision,'' <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> said. `` I had to leave my country, my family, close friends and relatives. My guilt is that I regarded my convictions and interests as my natural rights. But the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> thought otherwise. I was persecuted and my freedom was threatened.'' His statement, delivered in English, was voiced over in Russian. <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> gave no details of the circumstances he faced. He concluded his brief address by saying he turned to Soviet authorities for asylum and `` fortunately for me, it was granted.'' <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> disappeared in May 1986 after he was confronted by federal agents in an espionage investigation. A `` Vremya'' announcer said a special broadcast would be made Wednesday night to better acquaint viewers with <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s case. He is the latest American to seek asylum in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In January, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cheryl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, sought asylum during a tourist trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> serviceman <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> fled his West German base in April 1987 and worked as a snake catcher in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> after being granted asylum, but decided late last year to return to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and face desertion charges. The <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockshin </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in October 1986, complaining that they were harassed by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> because of their <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> affiliations. They reportedly settled into a new life in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and have no plans to leave. Also in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent who defected in August 1986. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> disappeared from his <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, home in September 1985 when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was about to arrest him on suspicion of spying.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a day away from his party's presidential nomination, invoked the memory of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Tuesday and pledged to work to `` inspire and uplift this country The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat and his designated running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, received a tour of the Martin Luther King Jr.. Center from the civil rights leader's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, and adviser <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> had breakfast in the candidate's hotel suite with <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Irena </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides, sensitive to accusations that labor wields too much influence in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, did not list the breakfast session on his schedule. An <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman called the breakfast `` routine.'' `` I'm sure what they talked about was how to win in November,'' said federation spokesman <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending most of the day in his suite working with speechwriter <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> on the address he will deliver Thursday when he accepts the presidential nomination. He met for nearly an hour with the Democrats' Hispanic members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a meeting they said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked for. Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> said they talked about involving Hispanics in the campaign and in the transition team, if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected. `` He wanted to establish a dialogue with the leadership of the Hispanic community in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON>. `` We were real pleased.'' While the convention wound up its debate on the platform, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attended a closed fund-raiser in a downtown office building. Accompanying the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was his cousin, Academy Award-winning actress <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The last threat to convention unity was resolved earlier in the day with announcement that aides to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had reached agreement on most platform differences. With Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> leading the way, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and their wives looked at exhibits at the King Center. The first one they stopped at contained mementos of the passage of legislation establishing a national holiday commemorating King's birthday, Jan. 15 One of the exhibits was a photograph of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signing the legislation. It included an inscription, `` To Coretta King. With respect and high esteem on a very special day.'' It was signed, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The Republican vice president is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' certain opponent in the fall election. Other exhibits included the key to Room 307 at the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. King was standing on the balcony outside that room when he was shot and killed in 1968 The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to King, as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded him posthumously, also were displayed. The final stop on the tour was King's tomb, inscribed, `` Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> 1929 - 1968. Free at last, Free at last, Thank God almighty I'm free at last.'' In a brief speech that included several quotations from King, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described the slain civil rights leader as `` a man of action, he was a man of inspiration.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was nearby, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that if elected he and his vice president `` are going to do our very best, with your support, to inspire and uplift this country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised the convention keynote speech by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and noted that neither he nor <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` have ever won any blue ribbons for great oratory.'' Then he added, `` And after <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> gets through tonight, none of us will meet the standard <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> set for this convention.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was the featured convention speaker Tuesday night.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the platform of his design Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention while a parade of Democrats ridiculed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a `` toothache of a man,'' and worse. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> promised an emotional, late-night finale to his remarkable primary campaign. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said it was about time for another president from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and scorned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a `` hear-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing vice president'' who `` was n't there, or ca n't recall, or never heard'' of the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale. On that and other issues, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, `` I think it's fair to ask, where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the man who is never there _ and he wo n't be there after the clock strikes noon on Jan. 20, 1989,'' the senator said in a prepared address that kicked off the prime-time speechmaking. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, the tart-tongued <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> agriculture commissioner, called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` perpetual preppie,'' and said, `` He's a toothache of a man, telling us to stay the course and threatening to lead us from tweedledum to tweedledummer.'' `` He is a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple,'' he said for good measure during what was billed as a presentation of platform material. The verbal abuse came after an afternoon of platform work in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sought to shed the `` tax and spend'' Republican taunt. He easily defeated <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. The vote was 2,499 to 1,091. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> prevailed as well on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for a `` no first use'' pledge of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s call for self-determination for Palestinians was debated and withdrawn. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces took the inevitable defeats with equanimity; there was little of the past emotion over Democratic ideals. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was introduced by his 27-year-old nephew, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, son of the late president. `` For a long time I have believed that what this country needs is another president from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' said the man who tried but failed to win the party nomination in 1980. `` Now it's going to happen. President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, it has a nice ring.''

 Three Mexicans went on trial Tuesday in the abduction and killing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent in 1985, and 124 potential jurors said they could serve for the 12 weeks the judge estimated the proceedings would take. The jurors who said they did not believe the lengthy trial would be a hardship were from a group of 200 potential panelists crowded into the courtroom of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> amid tight security. The potential jurors were handed a questionnaire asking, among other things, about their exposure to publicity about the slaying of <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped and beaten to death shortly after he and other agents uncovered a drug trafficking operation run by <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, who along with <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> was one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s biggest drug kingpins, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have claimed in court documents. Facing trial in federal court here are <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 28, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix-Gutierrez </PERSON>, 38, and <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON>, 36, who are charged in a seven-count indictment with either participating directly in the kidnap-murder of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> or acting as an accessory. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicchino </PERSON> imposed extra security, having officers handcuff and shackle the defendants in the courtroom whenever jurors left. Everyone entering the courthouse, including federal employees, was required to pass through metal detectors. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, as he left the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>. Several weeks later his body and that of his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala-Avelar </PERSON>, who was kidnapped separately, were found on a remote ranch 70 miles away. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> had been severely beaten, and documents filed on autopsy reports in connection with the case said <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s jaw was broken in several places and his head was shattered `` like an eggshell.'' Also charged in the case are <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 33; <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>, 65; <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Espino </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdin </PERSON>, 35; <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavon </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 35; <PERSON> Albino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazan </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, 27; and <PERSON> Ines </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 33. Except for <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pavon </PERSON>, who remain at large, the other defendants are being held by Mexican authorities.

<TEXT>
 Tamil militants exploded a bomb under a patrol car in northern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, killing five Indian soliders, military officials said Tuesday. They said two soldiers and a rebel died in another clash. Sri Lankan military officials, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said the five died Monday when the remote-controlled bomb was detonated near the northwestern port of <LOCATION> Mannar </LOCATION>. They said two soldiers were injured and five others were reported missing in the blast. An official at the Indian High Commission, or embassy, confirmed the five deaths. The official also insisted on anonymity. A statement issued in the southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> militia claimed 20 soldiers were killed in the blast. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, largest of the rebel groups, have exile headquarters in <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION>. The conflicting reports could not be resolved independently. Indian troops imposed an indefinite curfew on the area to search for the missing men, the Sri Lankans said. <LOCATION> Mannar </LOCATION> is about 135 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, two Indian soldiers and a Tamil rebel were killed in an exchange of fire near the port town of <LOCATION> Batticaloa </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, the military officials said. More than 500 Indian soldiers have been killed since <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sent an estimated 50,000 soldiers to this island nation to enforce an Indian-sponsored peace accord signed in July 1987. The accord was aimed at ending a five-year guerrilla war by the Tamils for an independent homeland in the north and east of the island. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved because 60 million ethnic Tamils in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are sympathetic to the Tamil cause in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Tamils, mainly Hindus, make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against by the majority <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION>. The Sinhalese control both the military and the government.

<HEAD>Authorities Spray Paraquat on Wild Marijuana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHEELER, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials sprayed the herbicide paraquat Tuesday to destroy marijuana on about 16 acres of private land, an escalation in the federal drug war that environmentalists attacked as dangerous. A Drug Enforcement Administration agent supervised spraying of a remote area about six miles east of this small <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> town, about 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Wheeler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` This is the first time that the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has been involved in a spray'' on private land, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> supervisor. `` From what I understand, there have been some state authorities that have eradicated before, but never with DEA.'' Using four-wheel-drive vehicles and backpacks, authorities sprayed paraquat on about 50,000 plants growing wild on six private tracts, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The spraying was not done by aircraft to protect the environment, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said. The spraying was the beginning of a three-day federal Operation Stop Crop, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. Last week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said marijuana has become the No. 1 cash crop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and called for a vast federal-state effort to eradicate the drug. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the owners of the land involved had not cultivated the marijuana and have cooperated fully with authorities. But he said the county's wild marijuana, which apparently was planted years ago to produce hemp for rope, had been discovered by `` entrepreneurs.'' He said signs were posted to warn people of sprayed areas. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Graddy </PERSON>, national chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s agricultural committee, said spraying paraquat is risky even when done manually. `` If they are going to go to the trouble of walking the land, it would seem to me that using a hatchet ... would be just as easy,'' <PERSON> Graddy </PERSON> said from his home in Midway, Ky. The <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a private environmental group, maintains that spraying paraquat is dangerous to humans and animals in the vicinity. But much of the debate over paraquat has focused on evidence that it poses serious health risks to marijuana smokers. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> issued a report in 1986 calling the toxic herbicide's use to kill marijuana safe and reasonable as long as guidelines are followed to avoid spraying in the rain or high wind or near buildings, and to make sure the pot is not harvested before the paraquat destroys it

 A pressure drop detected in January might have alerted engineers to the small leak that now threatens a long delay in the next space shuttle flight, but there is no conclusive evidence that workers acted improperly, the launch director said Tuesday. Director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said a search of paperwork shows that a pressure check was made on the oxidizer tank manifold in an engine compartment before Christmas, and a second reading was taken about two weeks later. `` There was a pressure drop of about 16 pounds per square inch between the two data points,'' he said in an interview. A tiny leak of nitrogen tetroxide gas was detected in an engine compartment of space shuttle Discovery on the launch pad Friday. Engineers have been puzzling over how to fix the leak without removing the shuttle from the pad, a move that could delay the planned early September launch by two months. The leak is in a fitting on a one-half inch line leading to an oxidizer tank, the same area where the pressure drop was detected in January. `` We wish we had found it earlier,'' <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. `` If we had found it when it was accessible, there would have been no problem. But it's in an inaccessible place, and we do n't know what we're going to do about it. `` We've got people looking at the prudent and safe thing to do,'' he said. `` What ever course we take there will be no compromise in flight safety. `` The odds are 50-50 on a rollback -LRB- of Discovery -RRB-,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said. `` We are reviewing all procedures and documentation and equipment associated with that event,'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said of the January finding. `` We are looking at the people who performed the test.'' He said Kennedy Space Center procedures require that any leak be tightened and checked properly. `` These two data points may still have been within specifications,'' he said. `` And I would n't preclude the fact that we have other data that says the integrity of the joint was confirmed. `` Until a final review it is pure speculation that a requirement was violated and not reported,'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said. He said engineers are considering a number of options for fixing the leak. `` We're looking at a fix in place, if that's possible,'' he said. `` But we would have to assess it as safe and reliable.'' To do it properly, he said, probably would require removing the 22-foot-tall engine compartment, a difficult task never before done on the pad. Another option would be to take Discovery to a hangar and as soon as possible replace the compartment with one being prepared for a shuttle Atlantis flight in November. Such a move would eliminate the need to wait for a leak repair and could cut the launch delay time to about a month. `` And I would n't preclude a quick fix with some old-fashioned Yankee ingenuity,'' he said. Flying with the leak as is a possibility, `` but we would have to assure ourselves that it would be absolutely safe,'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said. Nitrogen tetroxide combines with a fuel to power the steering engines in flight. If the leak continued in orbit, it ideally would vaporize and drift off into space. However, the possibility of it hitting a cold surface might cause it to vaporize and pool in the engine pod, where fire could occur if it somehow contacted the fue. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> moved ahead with a plan to test-fire Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad on July 28 The main engines are separate from the steering engine system containing the leak. Discovery is being grooomed to make the first shuttle mission since Challenger exploded Jan. 28, 1986, killing the seven crew members. Five veteran shuttle astronauts are to make the four-day flight during which they will release a communications satellite and conduct experiments.

 A chain of beacons burst into flame across <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on Tuesday night in memory of the fiery warning to the nation when the Spanish Armada was sighted exactly 400 years ago. Spanish Ambassador <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellacasa </PERSON>, letting bygones be bygones, used a long-handled, flaming torch to fire the first beacon on a damp and drizzly night. `` Two old countries like ours have to build, on our history, better understanding and friendship in the future,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The event was shown live on national TV as the ambassador lit the fuel in a big iron brazier atop an oak pole at the Kynance headland. The area near Lizard village in the southwest tip of <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION> is where local people say the Armada was first sighted. The lighting was followed swiftly by the chain of beacons and wigwam-shaped bonfires that extended to the Scottish border, 430 miles away. `` I invited the ambassador to light the first beacon because I thought it was about time, after 400 years, that we buried this old hatchet in a symbolic way,'' said <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Peek </PERSON>, who organized the event and called it `` Fire Over <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' The Spanish Armada's 125 ships carried 19,000 soldiers, 8,000 sailors, 2,000 galley slaves and 180 monks and friars, sent by <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> king of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, to overthrow <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s Protestant Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Legend </PERSON> has it that <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>'s favorite captain, Sir <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, was involved in a lawn-bowling game in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> as the great fleet approached and was so unflustered that he insisted on finishing the game before going to his ship Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is to visit <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> on Thursday to join Armada festivities in the city from which <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> sailed into action. Everyone seemed to be in on the fun _ even the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which issued 40 million stamps depicting galleons and cannon smoke. A breakfast cereal company offered `` Armada Treasure Replica Coins.'' The replicas are copied from coins found in Armada ships wrecked by gales as the great fleet struggled home after failing to link up with a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> invasion army waiting in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Historians have argued long over whether the English or the gales defeated the Armada. `` The weather did help but the defeat was a great victory for <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> because it raised the hearts of men in dark hours,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mildren </PERSON>, a historian specializing in Armada lore. <PERSON> Tamsin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, responsible for 10 of <LOCATION> Cornwall </LOCATION>'s 20 fires, said the villagers in Lizard had been celebrating all day, as they have done every anniversary for four centuries. She said the Kynance beacon, mounted on a 30-foot oak pole, had a trial firing Tuesday morning and burned for an hour with a bright orange flame. `` We are also having 2,000 pounds -LRB- $ 3,360 dollars -RRB- worth of fireworks and I was astonished to find when we opened the boxes that they were made in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitchen </PERSON>, a schoolmaster who has studied the matter, said the early-warning system of beacons and fires was unique to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and could muster up to 30,000 men within two hours. He said the procedure lasted to the 19th century, when there was a threat of invasion by <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s armies, and there is a record of one sentinel setting his beacon alight and frying sausages. `` In setting up the new beacons, we worked from secret Elizabethan diagrams which showed pitch at the center, covered by anything dry and combustible, topped by a thatch to keep out rain and the whole thing covered with brushwood,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, which looks after historic sites and buildings. `` The trick was to build a fire that would quickly produce a flame at night and a lot of smoke in the daytime.''

 Riot police wounded five people and arrested at least 270 protesters Tuesday when a nationwide general strike flared into street clashes and induced leftist guerrilla violence, officials and strike leaders said. Three of the wounded were strikers and two were children, reports said. Also on Tuesday, rebels of the Maoist-oriented Shining Path organization killed six police defenders and wounded five in an attack against a police post in <LOCATION> Pozuzo </LOCATION>, a jungle town 170 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, police said. The night before, officers reported, guerrillas shot dead a policeman in the nearby town of <LOCATION> Tochache </LOCATION>. The 48-hour general strike began on Tuesday to protest government economic policy. Strikers and student sympathizers blocked main arteries leading into <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> with bonfires and rocks but were driven off by police using tear gas and firing water cannons, reporters said. Police quickly reopened the roads. Officers said a train carrying workers to their jobs in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Chosica </LOCATION>, 25 miles away, was halted midway when saboteurs blew up a small section of track. The train stopped in time and no one was hurt. The communist-led General Confederation of Peruvian Workers said 80 percent of factories, stores and businesses in this capital city were closed Tuesday. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> called the strike a failure and said business activity was almost normal. Most banks and government offices in downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> opened late with about half their workers, the government said, and school attendence was low. It blamed the absenteeism on an estimated 50 percent cut in bus transportation. About half the shops and stores in downtown <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> remained shuttered. The confederation claims 90 percent of this Andean nation's 1.6 million unionized workers as members. It called the strike to protest government austerity measures imposed this month that include food price increases ranging from 20 percent to 100 percent. It is the third general strike against the 3-year-old government of President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a Social Democrat. The development comes with the economy in a tailspin, a steep fiscal deficit and an inflation rate estimated to hit 400 percent in 1988. The government declared the strike illegal and dispatched 8,000 police and army troops to patrol <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and ride public buses to ensure security. Police said 220 protesters were arrested in sporadic clashes in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, 50 demonstrators were arrested in a march and a 10-year-old boy was injured by a tear gas cannister, police said. Strike leader <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said police shot and wounded three protesters and a child during a march in <LOCATION> Juliaca </LOCATION>, 600 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. His charges could not be confirmed with police. Radio Programas, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s leading news station, said business activity was greatly reduced in the key highland capitals of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Puno </PERSON>, while interstate trucking was virtually halted nationwide. An indefinite strike by miners entered its second day Tuesday, paralyzing most mining across the nation, strike officials said. Police said leftist guerrillas supporting the strike since Monday exploded a car bomb in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, wounding three people, and launched bomb attacks against buildings in other cities, but no reports emerged of other injuries. Shining Path guerrillas blew up power pylons and blacked out <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>.

His heart would be full tonight. As a testament to the struggles of those who have gone before; as a legacy for those who will come after; as a tribute to the endurance, the patience, the courage of our forefathers and mothers; as an assurance that their prayers are being answered, their work was not in vein, and hope is eternal; tomorrow night my name will go into nomination for the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

We come to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the cradle of the old south, the crucible of the new. Tonight there is a sense of celebration because we have moved, fundamentally, from racial battlegrounds by law, to economic common ground, with the challenge to move to moral higher ground. Common ground! Think of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> _ the intersection where many trails met. A small village that became the birthplace for three great religions _ <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, Christianity and <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>. Why was this village so blessed?

Many people, many cultures, many languages _ with one thing in common, the yearn to breathe free. Common ground! And tonight in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, for the first time in this century we convene in the South. A state where governors once stood in school house doors.

Common ground! That is the challenge to our party tonight. Left wing. Right wing.

<BYLINE>Sharp Attack Prepared by Bush Backers Even Before It's Official

<TEXT>
 Even before <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> officially claims the Democratic presidential nomination, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backers were circulating a harshly critical video charging that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` seems to challenge American patriotism itself.'' The 20-minute video being distributed in the Democratic National Convention complex hits <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on issues ranging from the death penalty to tax increases to saying the pledge of allegiance in school. It goes to great lengths to link <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and contains some of the most strident assaults launched to date between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` But it's not just military muscle that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes,'' a narrator says. `` He seems to challenge American patriotism itself.'' In a statement distributed by a group called Americans for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ described as an `` independent project of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION>'' _ the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers said it was targeted at conservative Democrats who have backed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the past two elections. The theme of the video is `` experience vs. experiments'' and takes <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to task for a prison furlough program `` that released criminals for the weekend'' and attacked him for vetoing a bill dealing with the pledge of allegiance in schools. `` In his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, birthplace of the American revolution, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed a bill requiring schoolchildren to pledge allegiance to our flag,'' the narrator said. In one segment, the camera pans over the field of Democratic presidential candidates, scanning all of the group but freezing on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Most polls taken when the vice presidential nomination was still an open question showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> badly damaging Democratic hopes of winning the election. Organizers of the effort said they had scheduled a preview of the video at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, adjacent to the convention hall and home base for media organizations covering the convention. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who described himself as a consultant to the group, said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> officials halted the preview. <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> did not immediately return two phone calls seeking comment.

<TEXT>
 Former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Tuesday he still hopes to make a political comeback `` when there's an opportunity ... -LRB- and -RRB- if it's appropriate.'' The 50-year-old former governor made a brief appearance before the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation to the Democratic National Convention to help launch the 1990 campaign for state treasurer of his sister, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he would probably make few, if any, other public appearances this year because he is concentrating on completing a book on his political experiences and his views of future political directions of the nation. He has spent much of the last few years traveling abroad. His brief and low-key appearance contrasted sharply with 1976, when the then-38-year-old governor was the final presidential contender to withdraw from the race and endorse <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s successful candidacy <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who gave up the governor's office in 1982 after two terms for an unsuccessful campaign for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, said `` it's possible'' he might run for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1992 if Democrat <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> retires Asked whether he might run for governor again, he replied, `` you should n't un-expect it,'' but said that should n't be construed as a trial balloon or announcement. `` It's kind of hard to be in it -LRB- public office -RRB- 12 or 13 years, and be known by 95 percent of the people and know all the players and be used to that kind of life and not do it. You actually have to work at it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a `` toothache of a man'' who does n't care about the problems of anyone but the rich, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> told delegates to the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> has always been in another world,'' <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said of the vice president, who has this year's Republican presidential nomination locked up. `` His is an upper-class world in which wealth is given to you at birth. He is a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.'' <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>'s speech during platform debate drew cheers and laughs from the delegates. It was the second night in a row that a Texan hurled insults at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who claims a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hotel suite as his legal residence. State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> skewered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in her keynote address Monday night, causing delegates to roar with delight when she said the vice president was `` born with a silver foot in his mouth.'' <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, who supported <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in this year's Democratic primaries, honed in on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> early in his speech. `` Now here comes <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> II, perpetual preppie. He's of the Kennebunkport Bushes, do n't you know. He's a toothache of a man, telling us to stay the course and threatening to lead us from tweedledum to tweedledumber,'' <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said. He asked delegates to look at their family finances and see whether the Reagan-Bush policies have made life better. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said the wealthy have benefited. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s elite are out at the yacht club tonight, sitting about in their Guccis and <PERSON> Puccis </PERSON>, sipping a delightfully fruity and frisky white wine, saying, ` Play it again, <PERSON> George </PERSON>,''' he said. He said Democrats can help family farmers, small businesses and working families that have suffered under the GOP administration. `` Let <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> side with the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefellers </ORGANIZATION>. We Democrats will side with the little fellers,'' he said.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who has avoided publicity in the years since his father's assassination, jumped into the national political spotlight Tuesday by introducing his uncle, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, at the Democratic National Convention. The 27-year-old law student, who is still remembered by many Americans as the brave 3-year-old saluting his slain father, received a two-minute standing ovation as he appeared before the delegates. `` So many of you came into public service because of him,'' young <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told the cheering crowd during the prime-time TV appearance. `` In a very real sense, because of you, he is with us still.'' `` I'm not a political leader, but I can speak for those of my age who've been inspired by Teddy to give their energy and their ideas to their community and not just themselves,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said of his uncle. `` He has shown that our hope is not lost idealism but a realistic possibility.'' The appearance has prompted speculation over whether the son of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> will be the next member of the new generation of <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON> to enter the family business of politics. `` I think he'll be involved in public affairs one way or the other in the future, not necessarily running for office,'' the senator said earlier this week. `` I think he'll use his talents to try to make some sort of contribution.'' The senator said it was his idea _ not <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s _ to have his nephew speak before the convention. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he received `` an instantaneous positive reaction'' from his nephew. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is a third-year law student at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Young <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has fought to keep his life private _ `` He simply does not do interviews,'' said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> _ but is often portrayed as a heartthrob in tabloid photos. The uncle and nephew are but two of many Kennedys attending the convention. Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s youngest son, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> student who is running for the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, is a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate from <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Also here are the senator's other two children, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kara </PERSON>, who are running his re-election campaign in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, the oldest daughter of the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and an unsuccessful congressional candidate in 1986, is a Dukakis delegate from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Her brother, Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, is also here, as are brother <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and sisters <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhe </PERSON>.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, showing success in selling himself to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other black leaders, switched hats Tuesday and worked to sell Texans on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Here we have running on the ticket a man from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, a governor from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> delegates he hosted for brunch. `` But you know he talks the same language we talk in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, because he talks the language of jobs, and growth, and housing and health care, and education for all of the people,'' he said. Economic growth is a campaign theme of one of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s possible running mates, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Tuesday night he'd rather run against <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> than the other lawmaker frequently mentioned for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ticket, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague and friend <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a longtime supporter of supply-side economics, was `` extremely vulnerable'' to criticism, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> used the theme of economic growth at length before his home-state gathering. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is considered a major campaign battleground this year and was a big reason <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was chosen for the ticket was to win that state. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has `` taken a hit'' economically during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and he said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was a man who can help create jobs and who believed that `` government can be of help'' in restoring the economy. The room was filled with people wearing <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> buttons, including many who had supported <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s state chairman in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was on the dais with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and helped lead the applause. But some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegates were still disappointed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had not chosen their candidate instead of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. State Rep. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, invited to sit at the head table, did not attend. `` I have no problem with Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, but right now I'm campaigning for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said `` I'm sure before it's over we'll sit at a lot of head tables together. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was not confronted Tuesday by the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> placards which greeted him Monday when he began his series of meetings with state delegations. And he received his strongest endorsement yet from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appeared at a civil rights breakfast together, and afterward, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had demonstrated to him a sensitivity for minorities. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had not previously spoken much about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> since <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> selected his running mate last week. When <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made a campaign unity pact Monday, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was called in and then joined the others at a news conference. `` What was significant was his perception, his understanding of what had to be done to broaden the base for inclusion,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Coming out of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where you have to reach out to become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator, you necessarily have to deal with the blacks, browns, the farmers and ranchers, the workers,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Your orientation becomes inclusive and expansive because it is the only way to win. And the way he relates ... is indicative of his experience.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as someone who `` has acted more on his own for the cause of freedom and justice, more than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been able to achieve in the last eight years.'' The Texan also received a warm welcome Tuesday at a noontime rally with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, widow of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, at the Martin Luther King Center. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> highlighted <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s long civil rights record. `` He was one of two Southern congressmen who voted against the poll tax in 1949,'' he said. Much of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s day was spent in private meetings, preparing for his acceptance speech Thursday night and organizing a campaign staff for the months ahead. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to leave <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> together Friday for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> as the first stop in a three-day cross-country swing to launch their campaign. From <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the candidates will travel to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> on Saturday. They'll visit <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on Sunday before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Sunday evening. It was still being decided whether <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would go to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Crews used natural barriers to keep a 14,000-acre wildfire in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Teton Wilderness from reaching summer homes Tuesday, while officials in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> left fires that have charred more than a half-million acres to die on their own. Firefighters in northwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> got a little break in the weather, which helped contain all but two of 15 fires that consumed more than 20,000 acres of range and pinon juniper. Fires also burned Tuesday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, but none threatened populated areas and most were small. A blaze swept over a firefighting crew near <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 45 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, but the workers surivived by taking refuge in portable fireproof shelters, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrill </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. The northern edge of the lightning-sparked fire in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was closing in on Yellowstone National Park, but was allowed to burn since it's on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> land and not a threat. However, 550 firefighters used natural firebreaks like streams and rock formations to keep the southern border of the fire from reaching a small colony of summer homes in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, 12 miles away. Officials said unless heavy rains fall soon, it's likely the fire will burn until snow puts it out no later than September. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, five major fires accounted for almost 450,000 acres of the total. Nearly a third went up in a blaze near <LOCATION> Livengood </LOCATION>, about 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. Rugged territory in the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> fire, at an elevation of about 8,500 feet and in prime grizzly bear habitat, has complicated firefighting. `` We're not only shuttling crews -LRB- by helicopter -RRB- to the fireline, but during the day we're moving the crews around,'' Fire Information Officer <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Normally they would be able to walk from point to point, but because of the rugged terrain and downed timber ... we're moving the crews around. If we do n't do that, they're worn out by the time they arrive on the spot where they're supposed to be fighting the fire.'' The crews have little more than picks, shovels and the water tanks they carry on their backs to fight the flames. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, to the north of the Teton Wilderness, officials monitored several fires covering 11,000 acres. While all <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s roads and front-country campsites were open, campfire restrictions were imposed throughout the park's back-country, where fire danger forced the closing of some campsites <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials generally let the fires burn unless they threaten lives or property, critical wildlife habitat or commercial timber, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>, fire coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The fires open up dense stands of unproductive black spruce, said <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>. Natural revegetation of burned areas with willow, grass and berries provides food for many of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s big game species. Animals usually move away from the flames well before they are endangered, and few die in the fires. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> officials also tend to let fires burn themselves out. `` We've had several questions on that, and the majority are probably coming from some local guides and outfitters,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> fire information officer <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON>. `` They're for a good reason concerned that this fire would destroy some prime habitat where they take hunters in for big game hunts, and packers in for some hikes.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> held a public meeting in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> to let the outfitters and guides discuss their concerns and so the agency can explain its fire management decisions, <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> said. The low humidity and dry brush fueled the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> fires, which caused no structural damage despite threatening the town of Dinosaur and the headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Dinosaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. Only one injury was reported, on Tuesday, when a firefighter at the Flatiron fire near Rifle got cinders in his eyes. Fire information officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dove </PERSON> said the man was treated at a local hospital and released. The <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> fires were being fueled by dry brush, high temperatures and low humidity, officials said. In <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, fires that apparently had been set were contained Monday and early Tuesday, but not before destroying a home and two other buildings in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. And in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, an all-out air and ground assault by 1,000 firefighters went a long way toward extinguishing a 3,500-acre wildfire in <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Padres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Five water-dropping helicopters and three air tankers bombarding flames with fire retardant chemicals helped ground crews in their extensive effort to halt the three-day blaze, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> fires were reported in <LOCATION> Rich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and on the Uintah-Ouray Indian Reservation and crews were mopping up an 88-acre fire on Diamond Mountain in eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> firefighters stopped a 27-acre fire on Tuesday, but a new fire broke out about 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Prineville </LOCATION> and, whipped by strong afternoon winds, spread across at least 25 acres of pine forest, said state <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>.

The Baptist preacher delivered the invocation at Tuesday's session of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and said he had been asked to do likewise at the Republican gathering next month in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> While clergymen and other Christian politicians should not exploit their positions by depicting themselves as God's candidates, neither should they downplay their religious ties, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said `` If <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> made a major mistake, it was when he renounced his ordination,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. `` I think even the people who followed him, or people who did n't follow him, would have a hard time understanding how a man could be called of God, ordained of God _ and you're ordained for life _ and to renounce it.'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who has been close to several presidents including <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> but says he never took sides in a presidential election, said he would stick to that policy this year. He said he hoped both parties' conventions would serve as catalysts of a `` genuine spiritual revival in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' that would spread around the world, including the Soviet bloc. `` We are a very pluralistic society,'' he said. `` We should n't have a Jewish platform or a Muslim platform or a Christian platform, but we should have principles based upon our religious faith and of course the dominant religion in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is Christianity

 The Veterans' Peace Convoy of 31 American activists taking humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was helped by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's attempt to keep it from crossing the border, members said Tuesday. `` The publicity helped us greatly, and poor people came to us throughout our trip to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, pushing coins into our hands and saying, ` This is the least we can do,''' said convoy coordinator <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` The support of Mexicans has been great.'' The caravan crossed the Mexican border at <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> on July 14. It now has 20 trucks with 20 tons of supplies. The activists, who oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy aimed at overthrowing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government, spoke with reporters after rain washed out a planned demonstration in front of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. They originally planned to reach <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in June to donate food, medicine and other supplies, but were delayed by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refusal to let them cross the border at <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said that leaving the trucks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, as they plan to do, would violate a 3-year-old trade embargo. Now the schedule calls for arriving in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on July 27 after traveling through <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Members of the group praised the hospitality they received in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It's been fantastic,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Breindel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We stopped to ask this guy for directions to a hotel in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and he just offered this compound where we could park our trucks and a place to stay for the night.'' The American visitors noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> arranged an official escort for their stay in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. If they return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without the trucks, the activists face up to a $ 50,000 fine and 10 years in jail each. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said the vehicles could be used by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government for military purposes and thus were subject to the trade embargo Before the group entered <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents `` asked us to sign a form that said we would promise to bring the trucks back,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Silk </PERSON>, 60, a World War II Merchant Marine veteran from <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` It was another attempt to make it impossible for us to continue our journey,'' said <PERSON> Silk </PERSON>, adding that no one signed the document. Silk's truck is carrying more than 1,000 pounds of paper donated by a local <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> organization to print a Bible in the language of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sumo Indians. Other activists are bringing food, medicines and medical equipment. The convoy also has sent 300,000 tons of goods by ship to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, whose government celebrated the ninth anniversary Tuesday of its revolutionary victory over the rightist <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> dynasty that ruled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for four decades. Convoy leaders said they hope to obtain a ruling in federal court exempting their trucks from the Nicaraguan embargo. But they said that even if it's not forthcoming they wo n't change their plans. `` We're going to donate this assistance to humanitarian organizations for the relief of human suffering,'' said <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, a veteran of the Vietnam War. `` For that we'll risk any charges.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> condemned Tuesday's Iraqi raids against Iranian targets, accused the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government of sabotaging peace efforts and said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief could declare the start of a truce `` at this very moment.'' But senior <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> sources at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they doubted that Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> would succeed in his aim of achieving a cease-fire in a week to 10 days. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Tuesday that until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> takes concrete action toward achieving peace, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must keep on with the war. On Monday, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> declared after a year's delay that it unconditionally accepts <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598 which demands an immediate truce and troop withdrawal and sets out a peace plan to end the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, spelled out <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s views after meeting <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and after lodging a formal protest with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s air raids on a nuclear facility and other targets. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the air strikes were prompted by Iranian attacks. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said he told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief `` that in the view of the authorities of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the secretary-general ... has a totally free hand to declare D-Day at this very moment, which means starting implementation of Resolution 598.'' D-Day is the day on which a cease-fire would begin. It would be set by the secretary-general after consultations with both sides. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> called the air strikes `` a deliberate attempt to sabotage the work of the secretary-general and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ... to put an immediate end to this aggressive war initiated by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> held urgent consultations with <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> and later with Iraqi Ambassador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> to discuss putting the resolution into effect and the latest <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> held closed-door consultations on Resolution 598 and on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s demand to condemn the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destruction of an Iranian airliner July 3. The consultations ended Tuesday night without any decision or statement and are scheduled to resume Wednesday. The secretary-general's spokesman, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief believes `` the continuation of hostilities is a clear sign that the cease-fire must come into place as soon as possible.'' <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> urged the council in a letter to condemn the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attack which, he said, `` so defiantly mocks all efforts for attainment of a peaceful end to the conflict.'' Some diplomats said procedural matters, including translating <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>'s letter into other official <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> languages, would have to precede council discussion of this latest complaint. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity. The protest was lodged hours before the council was to discuss the shooting down of an Iranian airliner by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which mistook it for an attacking warplane. All 290 people on board were killed. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not obtained council condemnation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action and negotiations were under way to reach a compromise statement which would be acceptable to all parties. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was `` on guard'' against Iranian intentions and believed its decision to accept the cease-fire plan known as Resolution 598 `` might be a tactical decision aimed at winning time or decoying, with the aim of surprising us by initiating hostilities or preparing for more aggression.'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said that until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> takes tangible steps toward peace and demonstrates its sincerity, `` it is logical to act as if the war is still going on.'' On Tuesday <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> hit Iranian targets and Iranian warplanes retaliated by raiding a dam in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said a year ago that it accepts the resolution to end the war that began in September 1980 if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> does. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> at the time withheld endorsement, saying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had to be branded the aggressor before there could be peace. Among other provisions, Resolution 598 calls for a prisoner exchange, an impartial body to determine which side was the aggressor and massive international reconstruction aid.

 It sounds impossible. Lions eat lambs; lambs sensibly flee from lions. Yet even lions and lambs can find common ground. Why? Neither lions nor lambs want the forest to catch fire. Neither lions nor lambs want acid rain to fall. Neither lions nor lambs can survive nuclear war. If lions and lambs can find common ground, surely we can. The only time we win is when we come together. In 1960, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> by only 112,000 votes. He brought us together, and reached out. He had the courage to defy his advisors, and inquire about Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s jailing in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. We won by the margin of our hope, inspired by courageous leadership In 1964, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> brought us together and we won. In 1976, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> unified us again and we won. And when we do not come together we never win. In 1968, division and despair in July led to our defeat in November. In 1980, rancor in the spring and summer led to defeat in the fall. When we divide, we can not win. So our challenge here is to find common ground. Tonight I salute Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He has run a well-managed and a dignified campaign. No matter how tired or how tried, he always resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery. I have watched a good mind fast at work, with steel nerves, guiding his campaign out of the crowded field without appeal to the worst in us. I have watched his respective grow as his environment has expanded. I've seen his toughness and tenacity close up and know his commitment to public service. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' parents were a doctor and a teacher. My parents were a maid and a janitor. There is a great gap between <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Haney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, S.C. He studied law. I studied theology. There are differences of religion, region and race, differences in experiences and perspectives. But the genius of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is, that out of the many we become one. Providence has enabled our paths to intersect. His foreparents came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on immigrant ships. My foreparents came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on slave ships. But whatever the original ships, we are both in the same boat now. Our ships could pass in the night _ if we had a false sense of independence _ or they could collide and crash, and we would lose our passengers. But we can seek a higher reality and a greater good. Apart we can drift on the broken pieces of Reaganomics, satisfy our baser instincts, and exploit the fears of our people. At our highest, we can call upon our noble instincts and navigate this vessel to safety. The greater good is the common good. As <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said, not my will, but thine be done. It was a way of saying there is a higher good beyond personal comfort or position. The good of our nation is at stake. Its commitment to working men and women, to the poor and the vulnerable, to the many in the world.

 With so many guided missiles and so much misguided leadership, the stakes are very high. Our choice? Full participation in a democratic government or more abandonment and neglect. So this night, we choose not a false sense of independence, not our capacity to survive and endure. Tonight we choose interdependency, and our capacity to act, to unite for the greater good. Common ground. Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I share a common commitment to new priorities, to expansion and to inclusion. A commitment to expanding participation in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at every level. A commitment to new priorities that insure that hope will be kept alive. Common ground is a commitment to a legislative agenda for empowerment _ to the <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> bill for universal, same-day voter registration, to <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> statehood, to enforcement of economic set-asides enacted under the leadership of Rep. <PERSON> Parren </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, to the <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> bill for comprehensive sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Commitment to a new direction. Common ground is found in commitment to new priorities, to expansion and inclusion. A commitment to expanding participation in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at every level. A commitment to a shared national campaign strategy, and involvement at every level. A commitment to new priorities that insure that hope will be kept alive. Common ground. Where do we find common ground? At the point of challenge. This campaign has shown that politics need not be the marketing of politicians packaged by pollsters and pundits. Politics can be a moral arena where people come together to find common ground. We find common ground at the plant gate that closes on workers without notice. Common ground at the farm auction where a good farmer loses his land to bad loans or diminishing markets. Common ground at the school yard where teachers can not get adequate pay, students ca n't find a scholarship, ca n't make a loan. Common ground at the hospital admitting room, where the sick lie dying, unable to go up to a bed that's empty waiting for the insured to get sick.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Details Egyptian Torture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> called on <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> Wednesday to protect political detainees who claim they were beaten with cables and whips, given electric shocks and burned with cigarettes while in detention. The international human rights organization said evidence it compiled since 1981 indicated a continuing pattern of torture by security and other officials working in Egyptian prisons and detention centers. In June, 44 security, prison and police officials accused of torturing political prisoners from 1981-83 were acquitted after a trial in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Former detainees identified some of them as their torturers, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The group said in a 50-page report that its evidence of the beatings, shocks and burns comes from interviews with victims and from medical reports by the Egyptian <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s forensic medicine department. Doctors examining detainees who said they were tortured found in many cases physical scarring consistent with the complaints. Many reports of torture followed the arrest of thousands of political suspects after the attempted assassinations in May and August last year of two former interior ministers, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Basha </PERSON> and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Nabawi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON>, and magazine editor <PERSON> Makram </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, the group said. Most of those arrested were supporters of Islamic groups, and said they were blindfolded and could not identify their torturers, it said. An Amnesty official attended part of the 18-month-long <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> trial. The organization said it is still assessing the trial outcome, but that it did not want the acquittals to signify an end to efforts by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to end torture of political prisoners. The report was written after two missions to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and extensive talks with government officials there, the group said. The report recommended structural reforms within the country, noting that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s state of emergency has facilitated prolonged detention. The state of emergency began after the 1981 assassination of President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> by Islamic fundamentalists. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was among the first six countries to become party to a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> convention against torture.

 Democrats closed ranks Tuesday night and adopted a unity platform after soundly defeating <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s calls for higher taxes on the wealthy and a pledge to reject the first use of nuclear weapons. By clamorous voice vote, the delegates bellowed their approval after Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, D-Calif., said: `` This platform is for our children ... This is a document for the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' In the entire arena, only a scattered few voices were heard when <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> asked if there were any nays. After rebuffing the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign on taxes and nuclear strategy, delegates to the Democratic National Convention embraced a raft of compromise amendments on other <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> positions before shouting their final approval of the entire platform. The platform debate followed a script agreed to by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the party's presidential nominee-to-be, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. That script included a heated debate on a minority plank calling for self-determination for the Palestinians. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> side withdrew the matter without putting it to a vote. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the platform will surprise skeptics who `` said it could n't be done. They said neither party could say ` no' to the special interests, the lobbyists, the money brokers.'' The so-called <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` Fair Tax'' plank was defeated 2,499 to 1,091.5. There were 90 abstentions. The minority plank on no first use of nuclear weapons went down, 2,474.1 to 1,220.6 with 67 abstentions. As promised, the Palestinian platform never came to a vote. `` The deadly silence that submerged the issue of Palestinian rights has been shattered,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser. As he spoke, a huge banner was carried across the crowded convention floor reading: `` Self-Determination and Statehood for the Palestinian People.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> called the <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> plank `` a vicious kick in the teeth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interests in that part of the world.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s tax plank called for higher taxes for businesses and the very wealthy. But <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Frederico </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, said, `` Let's not tie -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' -RRB- hands with a tax increase.'' `` I do n't like throwing softballs to an opponent to knock out of the park and a tax hike pitch is a grand slam for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigns had settled most of their differences beforehand. As part of the agreement between the two campaigns, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces said they would not press their demand for a five-year freeze on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign made concessions on nine other disputed platform issues, from spending on education and Head Start to a call for a mutual moratorium on missile flight testing. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign also accepted intact a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> budget plank that states: `` Investing in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and reducing the deficit requires that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and that we restrain <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending.'' The platform was barely 4,500 words before amendments. Titled `` The Restoration of Competence and the Revival of Hope,'' it makes no mention of either <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but promises to reverse `` voodoo economics,'' help the homeless and needy, improve education and maintain `` more stable defense budgets.'' `` <PERSON> Jackon </PERSON> has had a greater impact on this platform than any candidate other than a nominee in memory,'' <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chief platform negotiator, boasted. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' negotiator, said, `` We do n't have anything in the document that runs counter to Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions. He denied a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign claim that the compromise language on Head Start, pre-natal care and nutrition programs for pregnant women and babies amounted to `` a commitment of roughly $ 9 billion.'' `` We do n't have anything in the platform that could be described as a specific budget item that would in any way commit the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or commit the next president, even theoretically,'' said <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Zogby </PERSON> said, `` We wanted a debate, but we did n't want a bloodletting.'' <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookbinder </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser who was formerly the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative, said, `` The pro-Israel community is very pleased with the way its coming out'' and that the majority plank is `` not anti-Palestinian.'' The platform calls for `` new leadership to deliver the promise of peace and security through negotiations that has been held out to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors by the Camp David Accords.'' It makes no specific mention of the Palestinians. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lost a 1984 platform dispute in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> over the no-first-use of nuclear weapons issue. Current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> policy would allow first use in the event of a Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told a forum at the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s plank, if passed, would `` shake the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- alliance to its core.'' `` What that says to the Europeans is that as long as the Soviets can contain it to a tank war, even chemical weapons, they can come in and take <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. The platform negotiators resumed talks Monday after a six-day hiatus caused by tension between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> plank was the last on the table. This shaped up as the tersest Democratic platform since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> ran on platforms of only a few thousand words in 1932 and 1936. The Democrats' 1984 blueprint was eight times longer.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that high Israeli officials have `` tolerated if not encouraged'' the use of firearms against Palestinian demonstrators and expressed concern that `` so few'' cases are investigated. The London-based human rights group said bullets fired by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers killed at least 160 Palestinians, including women and 55 people under age 18, in the occupied territories. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures Tuesday, 225 Palestinians and four Israelis died in the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the occupied territories since it began Dec. 8. Amnesty said in a statement released by its <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> office that it asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a clarification on its policy and information on investigations in the killing of Palestinians by the Israeli army. `` On the basis of available evidence, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities at high levels tolerated if not encouraged the ill considered and excessive use of firearms,'' <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said in the statement. It also said it was very concerned that `` few cases have been the object of investigation.'' Amnesty asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to explain the directives in force on the use of firearms and to provide the number of cases in which a serious and thorough investigation was opened into the killing of a Palestinian. The group also asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to explain how it reached its conclusions in investigations already completed, and to say if or when members of the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army were tried or disciplined for killing a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrator.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: get sick.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Common ground. What is leadership if not to present help in a time of crisis? So I have met you at the point of challenge. In <PERSON> Jay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where paperworkers were striking for fair wages. In <LOCATION> Greenfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where family farmers struggle for a fair price. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where working women seek comparable worth. In <LOCATION> McFarland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where the children of Hispanic farmworkers may be dying from a poisoned land _ dying in clusters with cancer. In the AIDS hospice in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where the sick support one another, too often rejected even by their loved ones. Common ground. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not a blanket, woven from one thread, one color, one cloth. When I was a child in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and momma could n't afford a blanket, she did n't complain and we did n't freeze Instead she took pieces of old cloth _ patches _ wool, silk, gaberdeen, crockersack _ only patches, barely good enough to shine your shoes with. But they did n't stay that way long. With sturdy hands and strong cord, she sewed them together into a quilt, a thing of power, beauty and culture. Now we must build a quilt together. Farmers, when you seek fair prices, you are right _ but your patch is n't big enough. Workers, when you seek fair wages, you are right _ but your patch is n't big enough. Women, when you seek comparable worth and pay equity, you are right _ but your patch is n't big enough. Mothers, when you seek Head Start, prenatal care and day care, you are right _ but your patch is n't big enough. Students, when you seek scholarships, your are right _ but your patch is n't big enough. Blacks and Hispanics, when we fight for civil rights, we are right _ but our patch is n't big enough. Gays and lesbians, when you fight against discrimination and for a cure for AIDS, you are right _ but your patch is n't big enough. Conservatives and progressives, when you fight for what you believe, you are right _ but your patch is n't big enough. But do n't despair. When we bring the patches together, make a quilt, and turn to each other and not on each other, we the people always win. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be off to private life, leave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on a one-way ticket _ a super saver. We stand at the end of a long, dark night of reaction. We stand tonight united in the commitment to a new direction. For almost eight years, we have been led by those who view social good coming from private interest, who viewed public life as a means to increase private wealth. They have been prepared to sacrifice the common good of the many to satisfy the private interests of a few. We believe in a government that is the tool of democracy in service to the public health, education, affordable housing, not an instrument of aristocracy in search of private wealth. We believe in government by, of and for the people. We must now emerge into a new day and a new direction.

 Humidity steamed through the South on Tuesday, forcing power companies to plead for customers to conserve, while residents of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> got some relief from changing weather patterns and a bank's fan giveaway. `` This miserable hot weather has got air conditioners running full blast,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. A cold front moving slowly east from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region and widespread rain from the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> moderated temperatures for much of the nation, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. But a strong upper-level high pressure system anchored over northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> drove inland temperatures well above 100 degrees. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> officials blamed the weekend deaths of two men on the heat, bringing the national toll of heat-related deaths to at least 43 since June 1. Officials in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> called off a heat warning after rain fell and temperatures moderated Tuesday, but not before an elderly woman and a 63-year-old man were found dead in sweltering homes. Overcast skies and scattered showers brought cooler temperatures to the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area, ending three days of intense heat and stifling humidity. The high temperature at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> Tuesday was 77, compared with low 90s over the weekend. Temperatures in the 90s for the past week across much of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> prompted <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to implement conservation programs. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> asked customers to turn up thermostats 4 to 5 degrees, stop running appliances and otherwise curtail power use until 8 p.m. Tuesday because the demand for electricity was expected to exceed the supply. `` The company is also reducing voltage throughout its 20,000-square-mile service area today,'' said power supply manager <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> in a statement, adding that the voltage reduction could result in dimming of television sets and slower operation of appliances. The two utilities had cut off service to some industrial customers for an hour to an hour and a half on Monday amid record power demand. Power demands also reached an all-time high in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials asked customers to stop running major appliances from noon to 6 p.m The temperature in <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, reached 116, breaking a 42-year-old record by 3 degrees, and in <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bluff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, it was 115, beating the 1931 record by 1 degree. In <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION> on the cool northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast, the 71-degree reading was enough to beat the 5-year-old record by 3 degrees. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> had a record high for the date of 95 degrees, and Quillayute on the Olympic Peninsula hit 97, a record for the month of July. It reached 109 degrees in <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, 2 degrees hotter than the record for the date set in 1946. Other Oregon records included <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, 93, 4 degrees hotter than the 1956 record; and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, 102, 1 degree hotter than the 1946 record. The suffering produced by hot weather was brought home to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, bank executive <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheffert </PERSON> when his air conditioner broke. Now, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> is handing out _ and delivering, if necessary _ 10,000 fans to the elderly and disabled and people with young children. `` I just kept thinking about the people who had no relief from the heat,'' said <PERSON> Sheffert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president. `` I figured there must be something we can do.'' He said the bank bought the fans for about $ 200,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and had them shipped from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on eight trucks. `` I think this is a wonderful gesture on the part of the bank,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMire </PERSON>, 81, who got a fan for her eighth-floor apartment. `` We've had some awfully hot days.'' Since June 1, deaths blamed on the heat numbered at least 5 in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 4 in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, 2 in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 24 in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 3 in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and 5 in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>.

 Reaganomics. Reaganomics was based on the belief that the rich had too much money and the poor had too little. So reverse <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> _ take from the poor and give to the rich. Today _ seven years later _ the richest 1 percent of our society pay 20 percent less in taxes. The poorest 10 percent pay 20 percent more. Reaganomics. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave the rich and the powerful a multibillion-dollar party. Now when the party's over, he expects the people to pay for the damage. But we say, let us not raise taxes on poor and middle-class people. The rich and the corporations must pay their fair share of taxes. Let those who had the party pay for the party. Reaganomics! We are spending over $ 150 billion a year defending <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> 43 years after the war is over. We have more troops today in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than we had seven years ago. Yet the threat of war is ever more remote. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are now creditor nations; we are a debtor nation. Let them share more of the burden of their own defense. We can use some of the money to invest in prenatal care, <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> and day care, to invest in education, to invest in our children that they might grow, and strengthen this country from the inside out. We must reverse Reaganomics. For that we need bold leadership, sound ideas and a new direction. Authentic leaders do not follow public opinion polls, they mold opinion. They set a moral tone, define priorities, and forge a mandate for change. Leaders address the moral challenge of their day. The moral challenge of our day is economic violence. Plants that close on workers without notice. Economic violence. Consumers gouged by corporate greed. Economic violence. A minimum wage that keeps workers in poverty. Economic violence. We must make sense. The No. 1 threat to our national security tonight is drugs. We must stop the flow of drugs into this country. Drugs are killing our children, threatening our neighborhoods, undermining our society. Educate the children, yes, but do not stop there. We are spending $ 150 billion a year on drugs. Children are not buying $ 150 billion worth of drugs. Athletes are not laundering that money. Bankers are. Let's get serious about a war on drugs. Bust the bankers who launder and the gun dealers who exploit. This party's platform commits us to a serious war on drugs. Convene the nations where drugs are grown, offer them economic assistance for alternative crops. Strengthen our <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and border patrol to stop the drugs coming this way. Education and rehabilitation for those who are sick. If the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, we will significantly reduce the flow of drugs. But you must cut the demand for the drugs. It must be a partnership, a bond between the government and the people.

 Despite dry weather, housing construction only partially rebounded in June from the sharp slump in May, and economists say rising mortgage rates likely will curtail home building for the rest of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that builders started construction of new houses and apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.45 million units in June, up 5.1 percent from the previous month. But the improvement only partly offset a precipitous 12.6 percent decline in May. The hot, dry weather of June, bad for farming but ideal for home building, also contributed to the uptick. And, mortgage interest rates, which had climbed by three-quarters of a percentage point from post-stock crash lows in early March, eased slightly in June, falling by nearly a quarter of a percentage point.

 Flamboyant rock singer <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>'s idea of acting is to raise his eyebrows and purse his lips. That makes him just perfect to play flamboyant record producer <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousseau </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> sitcom pilot, `` Heart and Soul.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is airing the show Thursday in place of `` A Different World.'' <PERSON> Rousseau </PERSON>'s foil is <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the reasonable, right-thinking half of the partnership. He is played by <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and lifts the sitcom above insulting stereotype level. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> wants to quit the business to teach high school music. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> is appalled _ `` We've been together since <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had cartilage'' _ and thinks a new girl singer he has discovered will change <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s mind. But her rather large, conservative father, played by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, thinks record producers are a sleazy lot and prefers that his daughter go to medical school. To convince the father otherwise, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> makes a stab at respectability by donning a three-piece suit. Checking himself in the mirror, he notes, `` If there was a charity for people who had to dress like this every day, my check would be in the mail.'' Day does n't deliver lines very convincingly, but his personal style is often delightful, as when he pirouettes to pick up the phone, or whoops his pleasure at the outrageous compliments dished by his mailroom sycophant -LRB- <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON> -RRB-: `` They said <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> was de king? He not de king. You de king!'' But the second half of the comedy turns to leaden melodrama when the aspiring singer -LRB- <PERSON> Tisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> -RRB- tries to persuade <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> to manage her career. When she finally sings, she has a great voice, but the scene is embarrassingly maudlin. One of the executive producers of `` Heart and Soul'' is <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s producer. With some inside-the-business insights and a few more laughs, this show might have given <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> a different kind of hit.

 WHY IS THIS MAN HERE? _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Candy </PERSON> seems pleased but vaguely perplexed about why he was chosen to be host of <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s live special from the Just for <ORGANIZATION> Laughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> on Saturday. The festival features mostly standup comics. Candy, a former cast member of `` SCTV,'' is a comic actor, but he's never done standup. `` They had called way out of left field,'' he said. `` I'm not really associated with standups at all, so I do n't understand. But I was flattered. I do have a great respect for these people.'' The festival began six years ago as a French-speaking event, but has expanded into a 10-day, multilingual festival. This year's headliners include <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Belzer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> Candy is Canadian, but he had n't been to the festival before, and is therefore a somewhat diffident salesman for the event, even though <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> arranged an interview to promote the special. `` They're spending a lot of time, money and effort there,'' Candy said, searching for something promotional to say. `` They seem very organized. There's a lot of great acts, judging by what I'm seeing It's very impressive, and it's got a big guest list there.'' Candy was a little more forthcoming about the movie he was shooting in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. He described it as a detective comedy a la Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau. Except for `` Splash,'' Candy's movies have n't been roaring successes with the critics. He's currently starring in `` The Great Outdoors'' with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>. He insists, though, that he's very happy with the script for the new movie, which is being directed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, brother of Candy's SCTV colleague <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>. `` I rarely talk about movies I'm in, but I feel very good about this one,'' said Candy, who is its executive producer. `` It's got a nice feel to it. Very reminiscent of some of our work on ` SCTV,' you know, creative periods where you can just feel it, sense it, good work.'' Candy said he's tired of dealing with movie people who `` know nothing about comedy'' and just try to get the movie out as quickly as possible. `` I'm tired of it, and my associations in the future will be with people I feel I can depend on and trust,'' he said. `` I'm looking at my pictures a little more carefully now If the odd cameo comes up, you've got to look out for money, we all have to make a living. But the ones I'm involved with, if you know what I mean, I want to make sure they're done right.''

 Because either they're more appealing or more keenly needed, Christian books these days are commanding a swelling audience that's looking for help in living. That's the assessment of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose international convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> this week staged one of the nation's biggest trade shows. It involves a $ 2 billion annually retail industry, doubled since 1980. `` The volume is growing steadily,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The market has expanded beyond the pew, partly because the product appeal is broader and also because of sociological trends. `` There's a renewed interest in religion in general, an acute awareness of the spiritual side of life, a return to Judeo-Christian values.'' About 11,000 people were registered for the trade show, buyers from about 5,200 Christian bookstores across the nation placing orders with about 350 exhibitors spread over 275,000 square feet of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Convention Center. As part of it, about 20 educational workshops were offered on such things as finance, marketing and management. In size, the affair is in the top 1 -LCB- percent of the 8,000 trade shows that take place annually in this country, as rated by the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Show </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Statistical extrapolations indicate the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> bookstores sell about 80 million volumes annually, with best sellers often selling two or three times more than books on secular best-seller lists. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said readers especially want `` self-help kind of books'' on difficult issues of life and `` understanding of them on a spiritual plane,'' both for themselves and their children. `` Publishers are dealing with hard issues that were skirted a decade ago, books on AIDS, child abuse, putting a broken marriage together, death and dying, life-related issues that everybody faces. `` We're selling information about life, how to change, how to determine values, what the Scriptures have to say about it.'' He said there also is big demand for books for young parents wanting `` quality products'' focused on nurturing children in values of honesty, integrity, respect for parents and other authorities. `` There's more recognition of the role of parents, and a conservative value swing in terms of Judeo-Cbhristian values.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, whose organization is based in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and whose glossy trade monthly, <ORGANIZATION> Bookstore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, has 8,000 subscribers, said books make up about 45 percent of Christian bookstore sales. An increasing proportion, now about l8 percent, is music tapes, with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> singers such as <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> and others gaining popularity and producing hits that cross over into the secular field. `` Christian music is one of the fasting growing areas of our stores,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. He noted that the stores also handle a variety of other merchandise, gifts, greeting cards, video and church supplies. `` They've really become department stores of Christian products,'' he said. `` That's part of the story of what's happening The variety of products allows selection according to the media people want to use. `` It also provides a variety in levels of complexity, from kids to adults, according to education and theological depth, from simple to the more educated and knowledgeable.'' Studies by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON>, director of the Center for Book Research at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scranton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, project Christian book sales will reach $ 3.6 billion annually by 1990. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said store managers have become more professionalized and sophisticated in their approach, and also younger, their average age dropping from 54 to 37 in the last 20 years. `` It's viewed more as a viable career from the front end rather than as a post-retirement kind of career,'' he said. He said the present demand for self-help books reflects the pragmatic American streak to find a `` quick fix'' in a `` society more success oriented.'' `` But much of life does not have a quick fix,'' he said. `` We're complex beings, mentally, spiritually and emotionally One of the deceptions of modern day thought is that things can be easily fixed by an instant dance in front of the microwave. `` But honest books point out that most things do n't have quick fixes, that they require changed habits, values, new ways of life, patterns and norms, things that come only with difficulty and time.'' Some books offer the superficial, how-to formulas, he said, and `` consumers need to be aware of it. Not many times can you just add water and stir to get the job done. We need to take a hard look at that.''

 Since 1980, the pre-tax median income of the two-earner family has leaped to $ 46,848 from $ 29,627, a sizable increase until you try to spend it. Do n't try. A lot of people who attempt doing so end up in bankruptcy court. While the figures cited are real as mathematics can make them, they are, for the practical purposes of every day life, as reliable as a swindler's spiel. There is a wide gap between perception and reality. In a sense, much income today is pre-spent on taxes at all levels and on Social Security levies. Moreover, what remains is reduced sharply by inflation, which erodes spending power as relentlessly as termites turn wood to dust. In real terms _ after subtracting for inflation and higher direct federal taxes, including <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> _ the median income for a two-earner household with two children has risen a bit more than $ 3,700 so far in the 1980s. That figure, from the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit organization that claims to have no ax to grind except that which is used to hack away at inefficiency, is but a fraction of the $ 14,000-a-year increase depicted by the raw figure. The disparity between appearance and reality might help explain the tendency toward low savings and extensive use of credit that has identified the 1980s as distinct from other recent decades. In explanation, it might be argued that a lot of folks tend to think of themselves as financially better off than they are, and then attempt to live up to that image. If it takes credit to do so, then so be it. Some, in fact, may have justification for living beyond their job incomes, having made wise investments in securities or real estate that provide them with dividends, borrowing power or saleable assets. But, based strictly on income earned from jobs, the financial story of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> families is not as pretty as it might at first seem. The <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> study says that in 1980 the median two-earner family with two children, and filing a joint return, paid $ 4,050 in federal income taxes and $ 1,816 in Social Security taxes, for a total bite of $ 5,866. In 1988, the estimate for the $ 46,848 median income is $ 5,623 for federal income taxes and $ 3,518 for Social Security taxes. The total of $ 9,141 supposedly will leave $ 37,707 to be used by the family. The results, however, are illusory, since they are stated in current dollars. That is, the 1980 figures were in 1980 dollars, and the 1988 numbers were measured by the 1988 dollar. The calibrations on the measuring stick were different _ like saying a foot was 12 inches one time and six inches another. What changes the calibrations on the measuring stick, of course, is inflation. And while inflation during the 1980s has not been nearly as bad as in the double-digit 1970s, it does add up _ and it compounds, too. The only way to make a sensible comparison is to use the same measuring stick, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> chose the 1988 dollar. By that measurement, the 1988 after-tax income remains $ 37,707; but the 1980 income becomes $ 33,393. It could be stated differently. The value of the dollar in any year could have been used to make the comparisons. The important thing is that the same measuring device, the same dollar, be used for both periods. Even then the figures obtained might not reflect reality. The foundation study, for example, included only direct federal taxes. It omitted state and local income taxes, to say nothing of real estate and sales taxes.

<HEAD>Not All Stars Want Their MTV</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Music videos have become one of the sharpest promotional tools for records since radio play, but their usefulness may be waning. Not all artists need, or want, their <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>, and record company executives concede that after years of trying, they simply can not make money selling video clips to consumers. While costs have increased, outlets for showing music videos have diminished from several syndicated shows to just two continuous programming cable channels and six major cable shows lasting from 14 hours a day to one hour a week. Still, such stars as <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>, <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arby </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> owe their success to the image they present through slick video productions that cost anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 225,000 to produce. `` When videos first started, it was an emotional point for everyone to ask for one, and it made sense,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, vice president of creative services for A & amp; M Records. `` I can remember five years ago that $ 100,000 was an unthinkable amount, and now $ 100,000 is a regular cost for a major production.'' `` Three years ago, I said there was no market for music videos in retail stores. That holds true today. We do n't even stock it _ it just is n't worth it to us,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> of Omaha-based Applause Video, with 85 retail outlets. <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said only so-called `` longform'' videos, usually concert documentaries or rock music movies such as <PERSON> Pink </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>'s `` The Wall,'' do reasonably well. But those are n't really classified as videos. Record companies, who finance artists' video production, tend to view music videos as strictly a promotional vehicle, according to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rovner </PERSON>, a marketing vice president for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. The companies usually make the initial outlay for the production then seek repayment tied to the success of the record the video is promoting. `` But 85 percent of our records fail to break even, and in that case we shoulder the entire cost,'' <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said. There is some recovery for record companies through fees charged for exclusive use of videos on broadcast outlets, but that hardly dents the production cost. `` What has changed in the past five years is the amount of scrutiny about why we are doing a video: What is it going to yield for the artist? Can we get a placement -LRB- air time -RRB- for the video? And will we realize our goals and the artist's goals,'' <PERSON> Rovner </PERSON> said. A new standard practice for newly signed artists at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and other major labels is a screen test. An artist's first step to getting a video may be his or her last. But even visually exciting acts have decided a video may not be the way to the top of the charts. `` It's always been our feeling that you should come see the band live, because there's no way to translate the energy and the excitement of what goes on stage and try to put it inside a box the size of a TV set,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON>, drummer of the rock group <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON>. For its `` 5150'' album, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Halen </PERSON> released no promotional videos, but later made a concert-length film from which video programs edited some clips. Similarly, the band has decided to promote its `` OU812'' album with a concert. Both albums reached the top of the charts without a video. `` Sometimes we will kick back and spend the -LRB- promotional -RRB- money putting a band on the road,'' said A & amp; M's Gold. `` You can put a band out on the road for a long time for what it costs to do a video, and in some cases, the money is better spent.'' Music videos rose to prominence in the early 1980s, but short promotional clips and segments from filmed concerts or shows have been popular since the'50s. No one denies that videos played in heavy rotation on Music Television -LRB- MTV -RRB-, Video Hits One -LRB- VH-1 -RRB- or <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- BET -RRB-, can mean big sales and instant recognition. `` Music video is as powerful, if not more so, than it has ever been,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> said. He noted, for example, that in the week of June 27, <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> had broken 10 acts of the Top 40 listings. `` In spite of the fact that <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> will be adding more non-music programming, we have never had this many acts represented in the Top 40,'' he said. Like other music video outlets, <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> has matured in its seven years, with 17 out of 168 weekly hours now devoted to non-video programs. The video rotation has dropped from 120 to 80 clips, and audience analysis has begun to determine what videos are presented, and when. One such change was the scheduling of `` Club <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>,'' a mix of new music videos and dance videos appreciated by younger teen-agers, for 3:30 p.m. when school generally lets out. Outlets have refused to show some videos whose content they consider controversial, such as drug use, explicit sexuality or nudity. Record companies also have to take into account that videos are presented in European markets on regular television, sometimes on children's shows. `` You ca n't have anyone smoking _ nothing risque. There's a whole list of things,'' said A & amp; M's Gold.

 Commercial airliners are filling the skies in ever increasing numbers, causing backups and delays that worry industry officials and leave passengers grumbling in airport waiting lounges. Industry officials in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> predict one of the gloomiest summers ever for flight delays as air traffic controllers struggle to allocate slots to a record number of flights in already crowded skies. One of the reasons is the makeup of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> itself. Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where airspace is controlled by a single aviation authority, European airspace is divided into 34 different parcels, each under different jurisdiction. At the same time, `` the air traffic industry is booming beyond anyone's previous predictions,'' said <PERSON> Klaus-Ulrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> international airline. The number of flights is also growing in the Far East, but officials in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, two of the Orient's major commercial air hubs, say the competiton for airspace has not yet reached European proportions. `` During the peak season, booking a seat will be very difficult and planes will be very, very full,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. But he added that conditions in the Far East were not comparable to the traffic jam in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s skies. At terminals throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, tourists are fuming, business travelers are grumbling and air traffic controllers are protesting. At <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> recently, several hundred <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> tourists recently waited up to 20 hours to get off the ground. Airport officials rushed 700 extra seats into the airport's waiting lounges and provided clowns and jugglers to keep passengers entertained In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, tourists staged a sit-in aboard a jetliner after they were told that their flight, which had arrived three hours late from <LOCATION> Majorca </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, could not continue on to <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> because the airport there had closed for the night. Airport authorities called in police to remove the passengers. <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> officials say some of the airline's ground employees have been threatened by angry passengers. Frustrated passengers broke into tears after 23 flights were canceled in one day at <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>'s airport, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said the costs of such delays can be staggering for airlines. He added that <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> jets alone have spent 4,000 hours in holding patterns so far this year over West German airports and estimated that the delays will cost more than $ 55 million in fuel, wages and maintenance. `` Civil aviation authorities -LRB- in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- were not prepared for the new surge in traffic,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` They had not made investments in new equipment, nor hired or trained personnel.'' Many air traffic controllers agreed. `` It is not humanly possible to handle 700 flights within 10 hours as we are asked to do regularly during the busy summer tourist season,'' said a senior air traffic controller at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prat </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. A delay in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can cause a ripple effect on runways throughout the continent, controllers say. The 170-airline <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- says the gap between the demand for air travel and capacity will continue in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> unless governments take coordinated action. `` We have airports and airspace capacity which can barely cope with today's demand, let alone tomorrow's,'' said <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Eser </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IATA </ORGANIZATION>'s director general. According to the Geneva-based association's statistics, international air traffic increased by 13 percent last year and is continuing at that rate this year. European air traffic also reached 13 percent in 1987, and is expected to increase by at least 7 percent this year. Trans-Atlantic flights, some airline officials say, could jump by as much as 10 percent this year. Industry officials in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> say a record number of Japanese are traveling overseas to take advantage of the increased value of the yen. According to figures compiled by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Narita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the number of flights to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increased 17.2 percent in 1987 over the previous year. Flights to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> increased by more that 31 percent, according to the authority. Air traffic to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> jumped by 12.8 percent and flights to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> increased by almost 10 percent, the authority said. <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, a major transit point for many trans-Pacific flights, logged a record 11,244 flights from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, a 20.4 percent increase over last year, officials in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> said. Aviation officials in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> admit they were caught behind in technology and in contol-tower manpower. But they add that European airspace suffers from unique limitations. `` Two thirds of our airspace is reserved for the military,'' <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said. Calls are growing for greater access to restricted military airspace, especially in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the air forces of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations fly regular training maneuvers. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is planning to pump millions into upgrading its air traffic control technology over the next fews years and has approved pay raises for controllers. Measures also are being taken to extend night operations at many European airports. To cope with the summer vacation rush, transport ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> recently agreed to set up a `` red alert'' telephone link among <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s five busiest airports: <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. A crisis center also was set up to coordinate air traffic during the busiest summer weekends. But aviation experts say no long-term solution can be found until a pan-European data processing and central control system is set up. Air traffic control computers in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s 34 different jurisdictions can not communicate directly with each other now. `` Flights often go over small countries in just five or six minutes and that country's air controllers must hand over the flight to the next country,'' said <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lischka </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we really need is a central European authority to create more efficient, less fragmented work.'' But <PERSON> Lischka </PERSON> said it may take years to put a unified system into operation. In the meantime, he added, passengers can take some consolation in the fact that most delays occur in the cause of safety. `` They just do n't take off until we can handle them,'' he said.

 Fear of more killing here in troubled <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> has brought on an acute farm-labor shortage just as the season begins for transplanting rice. Agriculture officials are concerned the shortage will not only affect the economy of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, the nation's breadbasket, but the national economy as well, because the country depends on this northern state's surplus to supply less developed regions. An estimated one-third of the 700,000 migrants who normally work in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> fled in May after a spate of attacks by Sikh militants left more than 70 poor Hindu migrants dead. Large but still undetermined numbers are staying away now, officials and farmers say. `` Earlier these laborers used to beg for jobs,'' said <PERSON> Pritam </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a farmer in <LOCATION> Horshiarpur </LOCATION> district. `` Now the farmers have to beg before these workers. Times have changed.'' The 58-year-old <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is among the hardest hit because he leases his 100-acre farm from a landlord and must come up with rent no matter what. He had 14 migrant laborers working the land, but only four are on the job. Most of the migrants come from the poorer states of <LOCATION> Bihar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> to the southeast. They usually work through the various seasons for wheat, corn, sugarcane and rice, going home in between. Sikh militants fighting for a separate nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> have attacked both Hindus and moderate Sikhs since 1982. Nearly 1,500 deaths this year have been blamed on the radicals from the minority faith. But the Sikh rebels did not particularly target migrant workers until May, when 31 migrants were killed in an attack on a canal project the militants oppose because it would carry water to the Hindu-majority states of <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rajasthan </LOCATION>. A series of other attacks ensued, killing 40 other workers, and the exodus of migrants began. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> agricultural officials say few workers are coming back despite programs to ensure the workers' safety. They also note that some farmers are switching to planting sunflowers for their seeds because they take less labor than rice. <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> has greatly increased rice production in recent years, from 4.5 million metric tons in 1984 to 6 million metric tons last year, by offering bonuses to farmers planting the crop. A metric ton is 2,205 pounds. But I.S. <PERSON> Brar </PERSON>, a state agricultural official, said he doubted this year's production would be much above last year's output, which was badly affected by drought. This year, the rains came but the workers have not. It was unclear if the labor shortage would cut the amount <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> farmers sell this year to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s central grain reserve, which is intended to relieve food shortages anywhere in the country. Over the last three years, which were times of drought in much of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> has produced more than half the rice and 60 percent of the wheat the government bought for the central reserve. Even the offer of wages substantially higher than those offered at home has not enticed the migrant workers. In <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, they can earn more than 600 rupees -LRB- $ 43 -RRB- a month, plus free food, more than double the wages in the poorer states of central <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. A 29-year-old migrant who gave his name only as <PERSON> Kalu </PERSON> said he fled after the May killings, but returned because he could find no work in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state. `` The money I had saved was spent in a week's time,'' he said. `` If I do n't work, what would I and my family eat?'' <PERSON> Kalu </PERSON> has a wife and three children and said he returned to <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> against his wife's wishes. He added that he failed to persuade other migrants to come with him. Another farm worker, <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Chander </PERSON>, 26, said he came back despite the troubles. `` Why worry about death?'' he said. `` You can die of sudden heart failure and you can survive bullet injuries, too.''

 A broad cross-section of American leaders says a distinctive hallmark of the nation _ free, non-established religion _ is threatened by modern battling over it. They've sought to stake out some common ground to protect that principle of religious liberty. In the conflicts, the pendulum was described as having swung in American history from one pole to another _ from religious to secular semi-establishments. But the standard is set by Constitution's First Amendment: `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> shall make no law regarding an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereoff.'' In the shifting applications of these doubled-edged clauses, controversy lately has ballooned and confusion multiplied about relationships of church and state, faith and politics. The issue has frayed political campaigns and engulfed the courts. More lawsuits about it have landed in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the last 25 years than in all the nation's previous history. The `` controversies over religion in public life pose both a danger and an opportunity,'' says an unusual, new document, the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charter </LOCATION>, backed by a wide spectrum of religious, academic, business and political leaders. Citing dangers either of forcing religion out of public affairs or, in reaction, politicizing faith for laws to establish a `` <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the charter calls for a `` renewed national compact'' about it. Social scientist Os Guinness of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, head of the project, says `` any sense of shared agreement about the place of religion and politics has broken down.'' He says `` recurring conflicts and the flood of cases about textbooks, prayer, abortion, and an infinite number of things'' will intensify unless there is a process for restored consensus. `` It's important not just to religion but to democracy,'' he said in an interview. `` Without it, there's danger down the line.'' He described the new charter, already endorsed by about 150 national leaders in various fields and expected to be signed by many others in state meetings this fall, as like the `` Queensbury Rules'' that restrained boxing from sheer destructiveness. `` It sets forth the place of religion in public life _ that's the heart of it _ and also guiding principles by which people of different religions or none can debate and contend robustly but with civility,'' he said The 6,000-word charter says the constitution's `` religious liberty provisions hold the key to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> distinctiveness and American destiny.'' The guaranteed rights depend on recognition that `` they are neither given by the state, nor can they be taken away by the state,'' but are inherent in belief in the `` inviolability of the human person,'' the charter says. It says the meaning of those provisions is ignored whenever `` the logic of arguments favors either an unwarranted intrusion of religion into public life or an unwarranted exclusion of religion from it.'' Until well into the 20th century, the charter says that there was a `` de facto semi-establishment'' of a generalized Protestantism, especially in the public schools. But now, the tendency was seen as swinging the other way `` toward the de facto semi-establishment of a wholly secular understanding'' of humanity and public institutions. The charter aims at mapping a middle course between the secular left, which has worked to push religion out of public life, and the religious right, which wants religious premises to predominate. The document, drawn up by the <ORGANIZATION> Williamsburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a private, public-policy organization funded by individuals and corporations, has gained an impressive array of backers. They include present and former chief justices, the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members, corporate executives, educators and various faith leaders, evangelical and mainline. However, it so far has n't gained support of some aggressive antagonists such as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes religion in the public sphere, and Moral Majority, which wants them prevailing there. The charter says religion too often is dimissed as a `` purely private matter,'' but this ignores the fact that the American system depends on `` ultimate beliefs, for otherwise we have no right to the rights'' it upholds. The First Amendment guarantee of no interference with religion puts `` religious expression on an equal footing with all other forms of expressing in genuinely public forums,'' the charter says. It says that some in recent disputes have `` insisted that any evidence of religious influence on public policy represents an establishment of religion and is therefore precluded ... `` Such exclusion of religion from public life is historically unwarranted, philosophically inconsistent and profoundly undemocratic ... Many of the most dynamic social movements in American history, including that of civil rights, were legitimately inspired and shaped by religious motivation.'' However, the document criticizes religionists who `` bring to politics a misplaced absoluteness that idolizes politics, ` Satanizes' their enemies and politicizes their own faith.'' In the conflict, participants often have been acrimonious and unfair, the charter says, urging greater balance, mutual respect and civility.

<HEAD>Stan Weinstein, Stock Strategist: `You Make Your Own Luck'</HEAD>

 When hordes of panicky investors dumped stocks last Oct. 19, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> basked in the wisdom of a personal adage, `` You make your own luck.'' He had warned his newsletter readers a month earlier to cash out. `` I sounded like a real party pooper,'' recalled the market strategist and publisher of `` The Professional Tape Reader,'' which proclaimed an alert in mid-August to switch from stocks into other investments. As it turned out, he was one of the few professional tipsters who predicted Wall Street's dazzling rally was about to collapse. Since then, <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said, he has received hundreds of letters from grateful subscribers who told him, `` You saved my life.'' His prescient warning earned him the title of `` Timer of the Year,'' bestowed by the market publication `` Timer Digest.'' It also landed him guest spots on such television shows as `` Moneyline'' and `` Wall Street Week'' and inspired sales of his recent book about investing, `` Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets.'' The fame and publicity are mixed blessings to <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, a transplanted New Yorker who works out of his <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, house and does most of his analysis with a pencil and paper. His newsletter business is booming at a time when many competitors are suffering a decline in subscriptions, a direct result of the October crash. On the other hand, <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said, he now spends extended periods on the lecture circuit away from his home, wife and three daughters, gets hoarse talking about his strategies, misses swatting a tennis ball and sometimes just wants to vegetate in his backyard pool. `` I do n't want to be a guru,'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said during an interview in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want the idiot investor who's looking for the perfect stock strategist The stock market is sort of like gambling, it's another form of probability playing. I'm a real good probability player.'' As for luck, the 46-year-old <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said, `` I do n't go for that. I think you make your own luck.'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> would n't disclose his worth or income from the newsletter business but dropped a few hints _ through the jewelry on his fingers and a big gold watch on his right wrist. `` It's very, very lucrative,'' he said. `` The newsletter costs $ 275 a year and I've got 12,000 subscribers. You figure it out.'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s professional and personal lives are so intertwined that wife <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> is his business manager, overseeing an eight-member staff that works in an office addition to their house. He said he typically works a 15-hour day, often late at night, on the twice-monthly newsletter. He exercises by jogging on a treadmill machine while watching the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> on cable TV. That's not to imply he thinks business headlines are useful, however. As a technical analyst, <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> dismisses interest-rate forecasts, government economic reports, corporate earnings and dividends as `` yesterday's news.'' Rather, his approach is based on a stock's charted behavior over time, which reflects what <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> calls its differing stages of supply and demand. Learning how to interpret those stages correctly is the key to success in the stock market, he said. The broader market barometers, such as the Dow Jones industrial average and the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index, react in much the same way as individual stocks do and can flash significant signals about future opportunity or risk. Even when he vacations with his family, the newsletter must go on. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said he's dictated copy via telephone from holiday spots ranging from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. He nearly had a disaster, though, when he went to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> island <LOCATION> Bora-Bora </LOCATION> on a deadline day. `` I found out after I arrived there was no phone,'' he said. `` I spent half a day making arrangements for a mobile telephone hookup. Well, that's the price I've got ta pay. I'm not going to lie. It's always with me. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s approach is n't infallible; he readily admits he can be wrong. But he claims his percentage of error is often less than others in the same business. Many of <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s contemporaries agree. Veteran strategist <PERSON> Yale </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, publisher of the Stock Trader's Almanac, named <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s `` Secrets of Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets'' as book of the year. `` It's very comprehensive,'' <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> said. `` For the average investor who does n't know too much, you do n't need any computers. It's a nice discipline.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurock </PERSON>, publisher of the widely read <ORGANIZATION> Astute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investor </ORGANIZATION> newsletter, said <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> `` gives a very strong case for technical analysis. His book is an excellent guide.'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said he's is flattered by the praise and hopes the book will continue to sell. But what if everyone started using <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>'s methods and no longer sought his advice? `` It's not going to happen,'' he said. `` Most people do n't trust technicians. They say we just use squiggles and wiggles. I'm looking for the sophisticated investors. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said he's been playing the market for more than 30 years. He started by using his barmitzvah money to buy a handful of what he thought were high-quality stocks. That's when he learned the hard way about the risks of ignorant investing: `` Within a couple of years I blew the whole thing.'' He developed his strategies for the best time to buy and sell based largely on an early career as a stockbroker and his own common sense, not from his BA in economics from <ORGANIZATION> Hofstra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` I had to learn to put my degree on the side,'' he said. `` The economics of today is the bull for tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> quit working for someone else in 1970 and went into newsletter writing, slowly developing a base of subscribers. He abandoned brokering, he said, `` because I was upset with the boss's churn'em and burn'em Although he gets hundreds of complimentary letters, <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said, occasionally he'll receive a nasty note from a disgruntled subscriber, which he keeps in a separate file. `` I once got one that said, ` Mr. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, my barber knows more about stocks than you do,''' he recalled. `` It was a guy who had subscribed for two weeks. I wrote him back and said I did n't think we were the right newsletter for him. I returned his money.''

 Taking some cues from the Bible itself, a group of Christian law enforcement specialists and other volunteers is teaching American missionaries abroad how to protect themselves from terrorists. As security tightens around the traditional political and economic targets, terrorists are striking at the more vulnerable religious community overseas, according to <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, one of the founders of the unusual organization. <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>'s law enforcement program, helped form Contingency Preparation Consultants, a private non-profit group based in <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that has provided anti-terrorism training for more than 500 missionaries from 18 denominations. `` We believe <PERSON> God </PERSON> is in control. But we believe as in Ephesians 6:10 -18 that we should put on the whole armor of God and use all of the knowledge, skill and ability we have to survive as soul-winning evangelical Christians,'' <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> tells people attending his workshops `` A missionary can not afford an armor-plated <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and would not want an armed guard,'' <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> says. But missionaries can be taught ways to avoid becoming victims of terrorism and increase their chances of not being harmed if kidnapped or involved in a plane hijacking. `` We see this as a ministry,'' says <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON>, the son of the late <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who served for years as executive secretary and treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` Each of us had a deep desire to put our specialized knowledge, skills and expertise to work in the service of the Lord. We come from different denominational backgrounds but share the bond of Christ's love. Others helping in the training of missionaries are <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who is now director of training for a major defense contractor; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a clinical psychologist; and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Klamser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a police lieutenant who commands his department's Hostage Negotiation Team. <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> says that in the past two years he's traveled to nine countries to conduct his anti-terrorism workshops, which last 2 -LCB- days. <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> has had several articles published in the non-denominational `` Evangelical Missions Quarterly'' and he's writing a book on missionaries and terrorism Almost 50 American missionaries have suffered violent deaths around the world in the past 20 years, including two from the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Pentecostal Fellowship who were among 10 people hacked to death by terrorists last November in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Klamser </PERSON>, the president of Contingency Preparation Consultants, says he personally knows of eight American missionaries who have suffered violent deaths abroad in the past five years. Four missionaries are currently being held hostage. While most of the missionaries have been released unharmed, <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> expects `` things to get worse before they get better.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 100,000 missionaries abroad `` are being singled out more by terrorists,'' he says. `` But they're not being focused upon because they are Christians. They're being focused upon because they're Americans and they're Westerners.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and private corporations have spent millions of dollars beefing up security at offices overseas, and there about 30 private organizations worldwide specializing in anti-terrorist training. But <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> says missionary groups ca n't afford to bring in private help. Contingency asks for reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, such as travel. The workshop speakers donate their time. The missionaries also turn to Contingency Preparation Consultants because the group provides instructors with a Christian background. Often the zeal of the missionaries makes them unduly confident in troubled lands, putting themselves as well as others in danger, <PERSON> Quarles </PERSON> says. For example, it took a lot of talking to persuade one Protestant missionary in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to leave the village where he was serving even though intelligence sources had indicated he was targeted by a terrorist group. He eventually left, for the sake of the village. Each anti-terrorism workshop begins with several scriptural references illustrating the concepts to be taught.

 <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> insists that `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' the new series about the Vietnam War, is based on real life. <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> stars as Nurse <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurphy </PERSON>, who is assigned to a medical evacuation center located at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Da </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nang </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. It's also the site of a recreation facility for American troops. The series, which made its bow on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in April, was created by writer-producer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacret </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broyles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a Marine officer in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> editor. Some people who were in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, either in the service or as news correspondents, have criticized the show, saying they never saw anything like `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> disagrees. `` <PERSON> Broyles </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and our stories are all based on things that happened,'' she says. `` One of our writers was a radio operator there.'' <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> says she's done some research on her own about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and hopes to go there this Christmas. An uncle, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delany </PERSON>, was the head of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and was evacuated on one of the last helicopters out of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> before the fall of the city. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>'' focuses on the women in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chloe </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, who will not be back next season as a regular, portrays <ORGANIZATION> USO </ORGANIZATION> singer <PERSON> Laurette </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` One of the criticisms has been directed against the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> girl, that the men in the show put her on a pedestal,'' <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> says. `` In drama you need archetypes. <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> was the innocent, although by the sixth show she was no longer innocent. And the men were very protective.'' As for her own character, <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> says, `` Colleen in the two-hour movie pilot was much different from <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> in the episodes. She's changed so much She's guarded emotionally because of all the pain and death she sees on a daily basis.'' Although only the two-hour pilot and six episodes were made of `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>,'' it has become one of the most popular shows on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and one of the most critically acclaimed. <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> is just back from a visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where her sister is living temporarily. She also went to the <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> film festival for the showing of `` Patty,'' a new film about the kidnapping of <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> on Feb. 4, 1974, by the <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. She plays <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Attwood </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> who was killed in the Watts shoot-out. `` I was in prep school at <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> when she was kidnapped,'' she says. `` A friend of mine at <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> had known <PERSON> Patty </PERSON>. I saved a Time magazine story about her. <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> and her husband came to <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> for the screening. The movie, due out in August, is based on her book and is very favorable to her.'' <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> worked on `` Patty'' at the same time as the `` China Beach'' pilot. She also will be seen soon in `` Moon Over Parador,'' a comedy made in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> which stars <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> plays an American actor forced to assume the role of a Latin American dictator who has died suddenly. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> is the power behind the scenes. <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> plays an actress in the movie <PERSON> Dreyfuss </PERSON> was working on. `` The movie we were supposedly filming is like ` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice,''' she says. `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> has a <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> look, with the hair and the white suit.'' `` Moon Over Parador'' was her second movie in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. She also did `` When the River Runs Black'' with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delany </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and attended <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. After college, she worked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for seven years, appearing in the soap operas `` Love of Life'' and `` As The World Turns'' and the off-Broadway production of `` Bloodmoon.'' She moved to the West with the play and caught the eye of producer-actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Keach </PERSON>. She was cast as <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>'s girlfriend in the TV movie `` A Winner Never Quits.'' She was <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>'s girlfriend in `` Magnum, P.I.'' -LRB- she turned down his proposal of marriage -RRB- and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>' girlfriend in `` Moonlighting.'' She was also <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s girlfriend in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` thirtysomething. Her only other series was a brief stint in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Sweet Surrender.'' `` It was a sitcom and I prefer drama,'' she says. `` Comedy is more of a writer's medium. It's all about getting a laugh. I like reality. On ` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>' my job is to remind people of the war, so that we can keep that edge of reality.''

 People recognize the melodies if not the man behind the music: `` I Can Dream, Ca n't I?'', `` I'll Be Seeing You,'' `` Dear Hearts and Gentle People,'' `` Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' `` That Old Feeling,'' `` By a Waterfall,'' `` When I Take My Sugar to Tea,'' `` Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine.'' These and scores of other songs are the life's work of <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>. At 86, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> is one of the last of a breed of songwriters who wrote their way from Tin Pan Alley to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> during the golden days between the two World Wars. Give them a job and they'd write a song _ fast. `` You know, you'd get an assignment on Monday,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> says matter-of-factly, `` and they'd be rehearsing the orchestra by Thursday. It's one of those things.'' If his name is n't as well-known as a <ORGANIZATION> Rodgers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gershwin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> or <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, it may be because he never had a big Broadway musical, although <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> did write the music for `` Hellzapoppin,'' the long-running vaudeville escapade remembered more for the antics of comics <PERSON> Ole </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> and Chic Johnson than its songs. The success that eluded <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> on Broadway was found in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>: dozens of film assignments, 10 Academy Award nominations and two best-song Oscars for `` Secret Love'' and `` Love Is a Many Splendored Thing.'' Now theatergoers have a chance to sample a Fain rarity, `` Ankles Aweigh,'' a 1955 Broadway musical that had nothing more on its mind than gags, girls and a good time. The show is on view at the <ORGANIZATION> Goodspeed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, that ginger-box musical museum in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haddam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, best known as the birthplace of `` Annie'' and for its sterling revivals of vintage musicals from the 1920s and'30s. It will run through Sept. 30. A new book has been written for the musical by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>, author and star of the long-running off-Broadway hit, `` Vampire Lesbians of Sodom.'' <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>'s revamped plot, still set in the 1950s, had something to do with Hollywood starlets, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and a secret code coveted by the Russians. `` ` Ankles Aweigh' is an old-fashioned show,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> said the other day during a visit to the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, Authors and Publishers. `` It's got a lot of good rhythmic tunes and ballads which I like to do.'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>, whose family lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was born into music. His father was a cantor. His older brother played violin in Broadway pit orchestras. His cousin was <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the great sad-faced comedian. `` Every winter I would get pneumonia,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> recalls, so the family eventually moved from the city to the <LOCATION> Catskills </LOCATION>. `` Living up in the country, all I had was the piano,'' says <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>, who taught himself to play and to write his own music. `` I had a rather interesting little alto voice. I'd just get up and sing my own material.'' After high school, singing brought him back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and a job as a staff pianist with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> who ran a music publishing company. `` They hired me to demonstrate and teach their songs to all the performing artists,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> says. `` I would sell the songs to big performers. It helped me learn to play in every key.'' He also performed in vaudeville and on radio as part of an act called <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>. But he never stopping writing. His first hit song, with lyrics by <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON>, was published in 1925. It's title was `` Nobody Knows What a Redhead Mama Can Do,'' and <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> was on his way. Two years later he teamed up with <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON>, a young vaudeville performer and writer. Their partnership took them to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and back again to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> and lasted until <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON> died in 1942. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON> contributed songs to such movie musical classics as `` Footlight Parade'' and `` Dames.'' The songs they wrote during those days were sweet and saucy with titles like `` Two Little Flies on a Lump of Sugar'' and `` When You Were a Smile on Your Mother's Lips -LRB- And a Twinkle in Your Daddy's Eye -RRB-.'' `` A good title is an incentive to me,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> says. `` I'll change my melody if I hear a good line. I'm not stubborn about it. That's collaboration. And <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> has worked with some of the best word men in the business. Besides <PERSON> Kahal </PERSON>, his lyricists have included <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Yellen </PERSON>, E.Y. <PERSON> Harburg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Parish </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>. `` When I play a good tune for a lyricist, it gives him some construction,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> says. `` Music can lead you to a different construction and sometimes a good lyricist likes that. It gives them a chance to dig for a different kind of rhyme.'' `` Ankles Aweigh,'' which has lyrics by <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, originally ran in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for six months. Besides `` Hellzapoppin'' and its sequel, `` Sons o' Fun,'' it was one of <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>'s longer running Broadway shows. Many of his other musicals, such as `` <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>,'' `` Something More'' and `` Toplitsky of Notre Dame,'' disappeared quickly. `` Flahooley,'' a 1951 <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> musical that starred Yma Sumac, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baird </ORGANIZATION>'s Marionettes, has developed an almost legendary reputation. The score, one of <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>'s best, graced a witty and satirical book by E.Y. <PERSON> Harburg </PERSON> that told the story of a laughing doll and its effect on the big business of toy-making. `` That show was the talk of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>, recalling `` Flahooley's'' triumphant out-of-town opening. Only <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> seemed unimpressed and the musical died after only 40 performances. `` It was a very unusual show,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> sats. `` Someday, somebody will revive ` Flahooley' and it will be a hit.'' If the shows were n't successful, much of the music was. Consider two of <PERSON> Fain </PERSON>'s biggest hit songs _ `` I Can Dream, Ca n't I?'' and `` I'll Be Seeing You.'' They somehow survived a 1938 flop called `` Right This Way'' that lasted two weeks on Broadway. <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> keeps writing today _ turning out new songs at his home in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I like to read the script,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> says. `` That gives me an idea for a melody. Many times, I play a certain little progression and the lyricist will say ` That's great.' If he does n't like it, I'll switch it around to fit a line. We help each other. That's the way to work.''

 Doctors and nurses in scrub suits the colors of sherbet wheeled another patient into the operating room for a brief procedure placing fertilized eggs in her womb. Everyone involved hoped they would cling there and grow into a pregnancy, but everyone knew they probably would not. The scene played out on a video monitor over the heads of <PERSON> Georgeanna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, whose in vitro fertilization clinic gets credit for about 400 `` test-tube babies,'' including the first in this country. In a month, the woman on the screen would receive a phone call, telling her whether or not she was pregnant. Roughly three times in four, even at the best centers like the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the answer is no. `` It's always hard,'' said the 77-year-old Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, as colleagues call him. `` But,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Georgeanna </PERSON>, who's 76, `` it more than compensates when you call to say yes.'' On Monday, it will be 10 years since in vitro technology was proven with the birth of <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the first of an estimated 10,000 such infants born to infertile couples around the world. In vitro fertilization has become routine medicine, a multimillion-dollar business and a catalyst of new ethical debate with each research advance. At least 169 in vitro centers operate in 41 states in this country alone, and with the proliferation have come questions that practitioners and policy-makers are now being pressed to answer: _ Why is n't success more common? _ Are in vitro clinics and their practices adequately regulated? _ Why does in vitro cost so much _ $ 4,000 to $ 6,000 on average per attempt _ and should insurance companies or taxpayers help pay the bill? _ Why has the federal government maintained a de facto moratorium on financing research? _ Have some clinics taken advantage of a vulnerable patient population to make a profit? `` Some clinics are selling false hope,'' asserted <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, director of a just-completed study of infertility for the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. `` A clinic knows if it has had any babies born. A clinic that keeps admitting people in the front door and does not have any births _ I ask you: what are they selling? They're selling false hope.'' He and others stressed that only a minority of clinics fell into that category. But the vast market for infertility services _ 2 million to 3 million American couples unable to have babies _ enhances the danger of charlatanry and fraud. `` You can charge these people more, because they're more desperate,'' said <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, who founded a consumer protection group in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for infertile people after her own years of frustration and sadness. `` What you've had is a whole lot of clinics opening all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with varying rates of success. And in order to break even they've got to get more patients in and charge them as much as they can,'' she said. Infertility treatments cost Americans $ 1 billion last year _ $ 66 million of that for what has become the treatment of last resort, in vitro fertilization, according to the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study. Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, whose lobbying made <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> one of the five states, along with <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, to require insurance companies to offer coverage of in vitro, advises anyone thinking of the procedure to ask questions. Patients need to know more than the basics of in vitro: the hormonal stimulation of the woman to produce more than one egg in a month, the retrieval by doctors of as many eggs as possible, the mixing of those eggs with the husband's sperm in a petri dish, and the implanting of fertilized eggs, or embryos, in the uterus. Patients should ask, among other questions suggested by Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>'s group: how long a program has been in operation, its rate of live births, how many retrieval procedures recover a mature egg, and how often the procedure is canceled before the embryo implant stage. Success rates should be spelled out, she and others said, stressing the need for clear definitions _ for example, a `` pregnancy'' defined early in chemical terms may never produce a baby _ and hard numbers. A recent report by 41 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in vitro centers claimed a combined rate of clinical pregnancy, determined by detectable fetal heartbeat, of 17 percent per embryo transfer. Calculating miscarriages and other loss, the chance of having a baby after one embryo transfer was 11 percent. The centers surveyed were among the nation's most successful; scores of others still have recorded no births. The <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported that 500 patients underwent 736 stimulation cycles last year. In 537 cases, embryos were transferred. Of those, 169 clinical pregnancies occurred, or 23 percent per attempted stimulation; 29.5 percent per embryo transfer. The miscarriage rate was 24 percent. Noting that even fertile couples have only a 25 percent chance of achieving a pregnancy in any one month of trying, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he's pleased with his center's total of about 400 babies to date. `` It sounds so easy to do: you get an egg and get some sperm, you put'em together and you transfer them _ nothin' to it,'' he said, smiling. `` In fact, it's not easy. It's a very demanding and exacting science and art,'' to interpret sometimes contradictory signals to harvest eggs at just the right moment of maturation. `` It just does n't seem to be a technique that's easily taught and transferable.'' Even so, 41 states have at least one IVF center. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has 22, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> 14 and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> 11, according to the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> report. The nine states without centers are <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Waiting lists for the established centers can be as long as two years. But the report also noted, `` nearly half -LRB- of all centers -RRB- have yet to achieve a live birth.'' Most centers are not-for-profit, though some are for-profit adjuncts of research hospitals and still others operate strictly as profit-making concerns. `` Who monitors the quality of care at these clinics?'' asked Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., chairing a congressional committee hearing last month on the proliferation of in vitro centers Noting that guidelines set by a professional group, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fertility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, are voluntary, he answered his own question: `` There are no federal or state requirements for accreditation or reporting. There is, in fact, no public accountability at all.''

 In a step toward consumer protection, he promised the federal government would survey success rates of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in vitro clinics and make the results public. Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marrs </PERSON>, director of the in vitro center at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' Hospital of the Good Samaritan, testified that even though regulation of reproductive medicine is a sensitive issue, `` the procedures performed are potentially dangerous without standard licensing of the facilities and personnel.'' Government involvement is not something that medicine normally seeks. But <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, too, chastised <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for staying away from infertility research. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> have never provided any funds for in vitro fertilization or its offshoots -LRB- such as transfer of egg and sperm directly to the Fallopian tubes, and embryo freezing for later implant -RRB- because of pressures which the politicians are not willing to buck,'' he said. Federal regulations require that a special Ethics Advisory Board approve government-funded in vitro research, but since 1980 no Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> has appointed the board. A de facto moratorium has resulted, and Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, who says federal funding would ensure better-controlled research, blames it on `` right-to-lifers'' within and without the government. For some, ethical difficulties arise as soon as embryos are created, the central part of the in vitro process and of research to improve the technique. `` I think it's just a straight-out fear of touching upon the whole issue of abortion,'' asserted <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for Biomedical Ethics. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, in its 1987 `` Instruction on Respect for Human Life,'' recognized `` no moral distinction'' between embryos at the moment of conception and fetuses and fully developed humans; they must be protected equally. Yet many physicians and ethicists do make distinctions and consider medical research using embryos to be justifiable. Regardless of the controversy, <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> argues, the government has an obligation not to evade an issue that affects so many Americans. `` It just shows a culpable lack of leadership.'' At a congressional hearing earlier this month, Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, sought to find out why the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has declined to appoint the required ethics board. For years, the agency fended off the question. A 1986 memo by an <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> staff member to Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Windom </PERSON>, assistant secretary for health, suggested <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> could reply to the American Association for the <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>'s call for an ethics board by sending a letter that was `` warm, but noncommittal.'' The memo said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> saw `` advantages in proceeding as we have, avoiding cost and controversy associated with a permanent board.'' Finally, facing the <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> panel this July 14, the department was ready to respond more fully. Just two days earlier, <PERSON> Windom </PERSON> testified, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> had agreed to re-establish the board. First, however, the board's `` charter'' must be re-defined and the new scope and purpose published in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, followed by a 60-day public comment period. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration could be out of office by then. `` They've timed it obviously so they can be free of controversy,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Nor are the issues of right and wrong simple in this uncharted realm. In the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s labs, among others, researchers are trying to find a way to help in those cases in which a husband does not produce the millions of sperm needed for natural fertilization. With micro-injection, directly into the egg, only one sperm would be needed. A purely humanitarian avenue of research to which no one could object? Ethicists wonder. Which one sperm? Will it produce a boy or a girl? Who chooses? Who's responsible if the baby is abnormal? For another question, the response is clearer: Why have couples continued to pursue in vitro for a decade, despite its uncertainties? The answer is in a portrait on the wall in <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' office, showing twinkly-eyed twin girls who'll be 3 next month: <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The day the <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> opened, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was at the door, the first to sign up for in vitro. `` I'd had several operations to correct problems,'' she explained. `` You just have a drive to have a child.'' Seven failures later, however, she'd given up. She and her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, had been `` saving every penny'' for years for the procedures; she was 38 and emotionally spent. `` When it did n't work,'' she said, `` it was just like a death had occurred.'' Still, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> asked her to make one last try. A month after the implant, the phone call from the clinic finally came. It was Christmastime _ and Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s present was two tiny heartbeats. She caught her breath, then shouted, then wept. At last, it was time for the announcement she'd ached to make. `` I asked my mother, ` Do you still believe in miracles?' She just looked at me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> recalled. `` I said, ` I'm going to have a baby.'''

 `` I must have done something wrong to deserve this.'' That diary entry from an infertility patient, reported by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, psychologist, hints at the fragile state of mind of many unable to reproduce, but doctors say there are well-documented physical reasons for the condition. Infertility is defined as the inability of a couple to conceive after 12 months of trying without contraception. Among women, the cause may be a hormonal disturbance impairing ovulation, or endometriosis, a disease in which cells of the uterine lining grow outside the uterus and disrupt the reproductive cycle. Or it may be scarred or blocked Fallopian tubes, the normal site of fertilization. Tubes are most often damaged by pelvic inflammatory disease; studies have shown intrauterine devices can increase this risk. In women, fertility decreases markedly after age 35. Male infertility usually results from abnormal or insufficient numbers of sperm. Researchers cite such factors as environmental hazards, drug abuse, cancer and testicular blood vessel problems. In 20 percent of cases of infertility, sexually transmitted diseases, often treatable, are blamed. In up to 20 percent more, no clinically demonstrable cause is ever found.

 With shoulder-length blonde hair, blue eyes and chubby cheeks, the world's first `` test-tube baby'' is growing up, in her own words, `` just like all the girls at school.'' <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> approaches her 10th birthday with a knack for writing stories and poems and getting into trouble for playing outdoors too late. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>'s birth in <LOCATION> Oldham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, on July 25, 1978, was hailed as a medical breakthrough on the order of the first heart transplant. As the first human conceived outside the womb, she gave hope to millions of childless couples. Now <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> has a sister, 6-year-old <PERSON> Natalie </PERSON>, also conceived through in vitro fertilization, and sees nothing special about test-tube babies. The sisters and their parents, truck driver <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 47, and his wife, <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON>, 40, live in a modest, two-story house in <LOCATION> Whitchurch </LOCATION>, a suburb of this bustling western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> seaport. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> attends a neighborhood school, <PERSON> Wansdyke </PERSON> <PERSON> Primary </PERSON>, and belongs to the local Brownie troop. `` I just like to play, and I like doing English,'' she said, proudly displaying stories and poems she had written. `` She is a very bright child, and if she can just learn to concentrate and work a bit harder, then she can do very well for herself,'' her father said. `` She's a monkey,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, `` but even so, she could be really talented at whatever she does.'' A doting father, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says he gets annoyed when <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> fails to return home on time from playing outdoors. `` I told her that if she was late again, she would have to write out 500 times ` I must not be late,''' he said. `` But she is so full of life and so friendly that it does n't make any difference. `` I was worried that she might grow up a spoilt brat,'' he added. The <ORGANIZATION> Browns </ORGANIZATION> volunteered for the then-pioneering in vitro treatment after failing to produce children in nine years of marriage. Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s infertility resulted from a Fallopian tube blockage. Her husband has another daughter, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, 27, by a previous marriage. Gynecologist <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> and physiologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> spent a decade developing the procedure that made <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>'s life possible. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said it was sad that <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON>, who died in March, could n't share in <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>'s 10th birthday celebrations `` But <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> is a sort of tribute to him,'' he said.

<HEAD>Test-Tube Babies Now Global Phenomenon</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-In Vitro Decade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Since the world's first `` test-tube baby'' was born in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> 10 years ago, the medical technique that made her life possible has spread around the world and spawned an array of treatments to help childless couples. `` It's been astonishing. ... The ideas are coming from everywhere,'' said physiologist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who with the late gynecologist <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steptoe </PERSON> pioneered the technique known as in vitro fertilization. `` There have been some amazing advances,'' especially in unlocking some of the mysteries of early human growth and hereditary diseases, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. Originally developed as a treatment for women with blocked Fallopian tubes, in vitro fertilization has produced a range of techniques such as embryo freezing, womb-leasing and egg donation to treat infertility in both men and women. Virtually every industrialized country has an established in vitro program, and many developing countries, such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, have entered the field. Because few countries keep records of in vitro births, no precise estimate exists of their number worldwide. However, a survey by <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> bureaus indicated at least 10,000 test-tube babies have been born since the first, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, on July 25, 1978. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> account for the majority of test-tube babies worldwide. But fledgling programs also have been set up in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, often in defiance of religious and economic objections. In the conservative Islamic nations of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, for example, theologians initially balked at in vitro because of the Koran's teaching against Western-style adoption procedures and birth outside marriage. But clinics have sprung up in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, mainly catering to the wealthy, and two clinics are expected to open soon in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, meanwhile, has established a flourishing test-tube baby program despite the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s objections to artificial reproduction. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, while imposing a strict one-child-per-family regime to control its population of more than 1 billion, announced the birth of its first test-tube baby this year. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first test-tube baby was born two years ago. In vitro researchers say assisted conceptions produce a statistically negligible addition to the population, and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> says those who criticize populous countries for promoting new childbirth methods `` should re-analyze their own view of life.'' `` A Chinese woman has the same urge to have children as a British woman,'' he said. `` You ca n't just set aside a group of patients and leave them to suffer in silence.'' Despite the proliferation of clinics, the Steptoe-Edwards technique remains a costly, hit-and-miss proposition available to only about 5 percent of childless couples. `` Nearly 10 years after the first baby was born as a result of in vitro fertilization, this treatment is still largely unsuccessful,'' said a report in the June 25 issue of the British Medical Journal. It said the latest figures show that in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> only 11 percent of women got pregnant and 9 percent had a live baby after a single cycle of treatment, and other countries with advanced programs had similar success rates. The treatment has brought `` an awful lot of joy and happiness for a lot of people, but also a lot of disappointment,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinsden </PERSON>, deputy director of the Fertility and In Vitro Fertilization Unit at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>. Eventually, he expects the success rate `` to creep up to 20 to 30 percent,'' but noted, `` It's a long way down the road.'' <PERSON> Brinsden </PERSON> and his colleagues are among world leaders in the latest in vitro spinoff known as gamete intrafallopian transfer, or GIFT, in which doctors transfer egg and sperm directly into the Fallopian tube for fertilization in the womb. The <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> unit has reported a 31.2 percent success rate with GIFT, but it has the drawback of being available only to women with at least one unblocked Fallopian tube, the normal site of conception. Although <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said his clinic at <LOCATION> Bourn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, has a much higher pregnancy rate than average, he acknowledged that the biggest in vitro advances have been in research into hereditary diseases, rather than improving the technique's success rate. Under the Steptoe-Edwards technique, ova are removed from the mother, mixed with the prospective father's sperm in a laboratory dish and reimplanted in the mother's uterus. To increase the chances of pregnancy, doctors now routinely use drugs to stimulate ovulation and fertilize and implant three or four embryos at a time, resulting in a high incidence of multiple births. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, which began in vitro research as far back as 1971 and has produced an estimated 2,000 babies, has pioneered the storing of frozen embryos in liquid nitrogen. The procedure, which saves embryos for later use if the first attempt at pregnancy fails, has proved highly controversial. In 1983, a quandary developed over what came to be known as the world's first `` test-tube orphans'' _ embryos left in <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> cold storage after their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> parents died in a plane crash. The embryos were offered to a childless couple last December, but it is not known whether they were ever used. An estimated 10,000 frozen embryos are now stockpiled around the world _ 3,000 in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 1,000 in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and most of the others in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, raising concerns over their fate should their parents die or decide not to claim them. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> have all taken steps to regulate in vitro. But the most comprehensive nationwide controls are expected to emerge in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where the government has proposed legislation covering the entire field of fertility treatment and embryo research.

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>'s famous poem, `` <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> at the Bat,'' to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>'s short story, `` You Could Look It Up,'' baseball has been literature's favorite sport. That tradition continues with <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>'s `` Season Ticket'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 18.95 -RRB-, the fourth book the fiction editor at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine has written about the summer game. Although he writes about drugs and strikes, temperamental owners and million-dollar salaries, <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> believes the real story is still on the playing field. And he approvingly cites the saying of the late <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Veeck </PERSON> that baseball is a game to savor. `` This insatiable thirst by the fans for what someone is really like is OK,'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> said, `` but I think they sort of miss the point for why they're there in the first place.'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> has been writing about baseball since 1962. Each year, he visits the spring training camps in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, travels to ballparks around the country during the regular season and attends as many post-season games as possible. He is not just interested in the games themselves but how they are played. `` The past few years I've been asking how they catch, how they pitch,'' he said in an interview. `` The players, once they know you're interested in what they're doing, you ca n't shut them up.'' `` Season Ticket'' compiles articles starting with the 1983 season through the summer of 1987, when <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> describes a visit to baseball's Hall of Fame in <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION>, N.Y. Whether writing about the 1986 World Series or discussing the intricacies of how catchers field their position, <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> is continually surprised at how much there is to learn about baseball. `` I'm just beginning to understand. We all go through this. It's very easy for fans to think that they know the game,'' he said `` Listen to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> announcer -RRB- <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarver </PERSON>. This is a guy who's been playing the game all his life and everytime I listen I learn something new.'' In the preface of `` Season Ticket,'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> writes that baseball is a game that can never be fully understood: `` I will always be an amateur of baseball, but I no longer feel like an outsider; none of the old pros I talked to ... gave me the impression that he had subdued the game, either. We are baffled but still learning, and we keep coming back for more.'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> was born in 1920. His mother, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON>, was an editor at the New Yorker for many years. His stepfather was E.B. White. `` He -LRB- White -RRB- suffered writing but made it look easy,'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> said. `` He taught me how difficult it is to write.'' Although he admires the spare, clean prose that was White's trademark, <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> changes his style when writing about baseball `` I think that I've developed a habit of rather long sentences with parentheses which I do n't use in other writing,'' he said. `` You use run-on sentences like the flavor of the run-on feeling in the ballgame.'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> believes the pace of a baseball game makes it easier to write about. `` Baseball is linear. One thing happens, then something else happens,'' he said. `` You can take notes. You can go back and recreate a game and you can almost always explain why something happened. `` You ca n't do that with basketball or hockey _ they move too fast.'' As someone who became a fan when <PERSON> Babe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> was in his prime, <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> has seen many changes: night games, artificial turf, the designated hitter. He has lost none of his enthusiasm. `` The game itself has hardly changed at all in our lifetime. The leagues are bigger, the players are better paid but it has the same feel. It's a real part of summer.'' Like many fans, <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> has imagined himself playing in the major leagues. He was a pitcher in high school and use to dream about striking out the side. He remembers when his fantasy stopped. `` At some point in my upper 30s or early 40s, I was seeing a psychiatrist and I came in with a dream,'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> recalled. `` I dreamed that there were some bushes and shrubbery and there was a gravestone with my name and my birthday on it and the year I was in. `` I took this dream to my shrink with some trepidation and he asked how I felt and I said I felt sort of sad. He asked me what the gravestone reminded me of and I said it reminds of those stones out in center field in Yankee Stadium. `` Then I realized it meant the end of my baseball dreams.'' In a chapter discussing the drug problems that have tarnished baseball's image in recent years, <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> warns against expecting too much of the players: `` I think a great many of us have begun to see how deeply we want baseball players and other athletes to be better than we are. We may wish this now more than ever before, because other heroes _ in politics, in our daily lives _ seem to be in short supply.'' <PERSON> Angell </PERSON> never worries about expecting too much from the game itself. `` The enthusiasm I have for baseball is real,'' he said. `` My appreciation has increased with the knowledge. I've noticed a lot of players feel this way too.''

<HEAD>``Short Circuit 2''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In a summer that delivered an army of dwarfs and an extremely charming rabbit to movie theaters, one might wonder whether a talking robot is a little much. No way! `` Short Circuit 2,'' a sequel to the original of a few seasons back, is a sweet surprise package that will charm your socks off. Its star is unquestionably a robot, but never has a hunk of metal been quite so adorable. If you remember the first, `` Short Circuit,'' the creature dubbed `` Number Five'' was invented as a tool of war. But the robot was struck by lightning, reprogrammed itself and escaped from the military. `` Number Five is alive!'' said promos for the first movie. Now, two years later, the robot has taken a human name _ <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Five </PERSON> _ and his adventurous spirit craves `` input,'' information on the world around him. Meanwhile, his inventor, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahrvi </PERSON>, an Indian who speaks <PERSON> Malaprop </PERSON>, has fallen on hard times. Fired from the military, the inventor, played by <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, has taken to selling miniature <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Fives </PERSON> on streetcorners. A department store buyer falls in love with the toys, orders 1,000 of them and the plot is off and running. When <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Five </PERSON> is shipped to the big city to help with toy production, the country-bred robot's circuits get overloaded with `` input.'' Adventures abound. <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Five </PERSON> gets involved with street hoodlums and bank robbers and becomes the intermediary in a love affair. He gets mugged, hugged and spray painted with graffiti. And he tries on an array of colorful outfits seeking his own fashion image. When he's pushed out the window of a 34-story skyscraper, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Five </PERSON> has a magical way out. After all, this is a fairy tale. The gleaming backdrop, by the way, is <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. In various action scenes, <PERSON> Johny </PERSON> <PERSON> Five </PERSON> flies, swings from a crane, and dizzily spins two villains who intrude upon the toy factory. Johnny Five is supported by some able human actors. In addition to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as the addled <PERSON> Jahrvi </PERSON>, there's <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> as a small-time hustler whose baser instincts are reformed by <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Five </PERSON>'s friendship. The always amusing <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> is a sneaky villain named <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s direction of the script by <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddock </PERSON> keeps things moving at a breathtaking pace and focuses always on the man of the hour _ our iron-clad Superman. `` Short Circuit 2'' is rated PG, presumably for some fairly mild language and violence -LRB- to a robot? -RRB-. Take the kids by all means. _ ^ By <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>``A Summer Story''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 `` A Summer Story'' is a sad, beautiful romance of human choices and regrets, and of how love sometimes fails to overcome differences between people. Set in the gorgeous <LOCATION> Devon </LOCATION> countryside just after the turn of the century, the film focuses on upper-class Londoner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilby </PERSON> -RRB-, who is spending a holiday trekking through the moors when he twists his ankle. While recovering, he rents a room in a farmhouse, where he soon falls in love with the incredibly pretty <PERSON> Megan </PERSON>, a farm girl portrayed by film newcomer <PERSON> Imogen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubbs </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON>'s presence is resented by farm owner Mrs. <PERSON> Narracombe </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Susannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -RRB- and by her son, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> -RRB-, who long has hoped to marry <PERSON> Megan </PERSON>. After a few idyllic and clandestine midnight meetings, the young lovers must part, although <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> promises to return to fetch <PERSON> Megan </PERSON>. The outcome of this romance is influenced by the social class boundaries so rigid in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> before World War I. But the choices <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> faces also deal with timeless issues of commitment, responsibility and free will. Directed by <PERSON> Piers </PERSON> <PERSON> Haggard </PERSON>, `` A Summer Story'' is being shown in theaters only in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and perhaps up to 50 other big cities. It is a quiet film unlikely to attract the mass audience drawn by blockbusters and adventure movies. But it belongs to a too often overlooked class of films that deal with real people and genuine human emotions _ films that touch the heart and the brain rather than blast the eardrums. <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON>'s screenplay is based on `` The Apple Tree,'' a classic romance story written in 1916 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galsworthy </PERSON>, the British author best known for his `` Forsyte Saga'' trilogy. `` A Summer Story,'' released by <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, was produced by <PERSON> Danton </PERSON> <PERSON> Rissner </PERSON>. It is rated PG-13, with adult themes and some sex and nudity. Running time: 95 minutes. _ ^ By <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>``Full Metal Jacket''@ (Warner Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95;</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Rated R -RRB- <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON> was at a disadvantage when `` Full Metal Jacket'' hit the nation's movie screens last summer. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>'s `` Platoon'' had already nabbed Academy Awards, including best picture, and helped galvanize a nation around the haunting reminders of a terrifying time Other Vietnam War movies also had floated by: <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>'s `` Gardens of Stone,'' <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chetwynd </PERSON>'s `` The Hanoi Hilton'' and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>'s `` Hamburger Hill. Still, <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>'s electrifying excursion into military mania managed to snare its share of the moviegoing audience. In fact, film buffs had long awaited <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>'s next work, seven years after `` The Shining,'' and were curious to see how he would treat the madness of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after depicting modern insanities in `` Paths of Glory,'' `` 2001: A Space Odyssey'' and `` Dr. <PERSON> Strangelove </PERSON>, Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.'' Based on <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON>'s gripping novel, `` The Short Timers,'' <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>'s work actually is two movies with the same characters: The first part, and by far the best, takes place at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where recruits are stripped of their humanity to become killing machines; the second part shifts to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, where the marines fight the Tet offensive. We see the best of <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>'s talents in `` Full Metal Jacket'' _ the title refers to the casings on the bullets _ in the slick editing and direction of Gunnery Sgt. <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> working the last nerves of his boys. `` You will be ready to eat your own guts and ask for seconds,'' he tells them. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ermey </PERSON>, a former marine drill instructor himself, is outstanding as <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Onofrio </PERSON> as his major victim, dubbed Pvt. <PERSON> Gomer </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON> by the sergeant, also puts in an excellent performance. Kubrick seals each training scene with a tension that zooms us to the next. But when the action shifts to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> all that tension is lost, and one of the worst battles of the war becomes a whimper. Part of the problem is that the movie was shot in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, which would have lent a much-needed authenticity. Still, <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON>'s effort is worthy of home viewing. _ ^ By <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Barclay </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>``Forever, Lulu'' (RCA@Columbia Home Video, VHS-Beta, $79.95,</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Rated R -RRB- `` Forever, <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON>'' has everything: a rock star -LRB- <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> -RRB-, a foreign film star -LRB- <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schygulla </PERSON> -RRB-, Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westheimer </PERSON>, an S & amp; M club, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>'s Own salad dressing, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, organized crime and mystery. Unfortunately, though, when all those elements come together what's created is not much more than an awkward, sloppy misadventure. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>'s `` Forever, <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON>'' recalls the far better `` Desperately Seeking <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>,'' with its rock star, hapless heroine and a mystery that turns on her getting someone else's coat. But even the acclaimed <PERSON> Schygulla </PERSON> seems uncomfortable in this role. <PERSON> Schygulla </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>, an unrecognized writer who's been mugged, fired, dropped by her agent and is desperate enough to consider killing herself. At one point her agent tells her, `` You'll always be on your own.'' She replies, `` So's <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>.'' Much of the movie makes as much sense. Because of the coat, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> finds herself trailing an elusive woman called <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON> -LRB- Harry -RRB-, wanders into a gangsters' hideaway, witnesses a shootout and walks out with their loot. Of course, she becomes a hero and a star. <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> is a bright spot as <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>'s oddball friend. _ ^ By <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacVean </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>``Scenes From the Southside'' (RCA) _ Bruce Hornsby and the</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Range While `` Scenes From the Southside'' is n't the first music to evoke the atmosphere of <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, it may be the first to do it with a piano rather than a mandolin, banjo or fiddle. But few records have a stronger sense of a region than the second album from <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> and the Range. <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> pleads for preservation of the environment on `` Look Out Any Window,'' sings about a small-town scandal on `` The <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>'' and jabs fundamentalist preachers common to the region on `` <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>'s Ladder'' and `` Defenders of the Flag.'' <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> and his brother and writing partner, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>, show a novelist's eye for detail in describing the area where they were raised. <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>'s piano is more dominant than on the band's first album, the hit `` The Way It Is.'' <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON>, who gives himself plenty of time for solos on the 48-minute record, has a jazzy sense of phrasing that recalls <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, but he plays with a <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> Lewis-like velocity. It's a unique blend, and one to be embraced by listeners weary of synthesizers. The record could use more diversity in tempo and instrumentation; for example, <PERSON> Hornsby </PERSON> makes little use of his skill on the accordian. Such quibbles aside, `` Scenes From the Southside'' is an album delivered with considerable honesty and heart.

<HEAD>``Diesel and Dust'' (Columbia) _ Midnight Oil</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 If <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would adopt `` Dream World'' from Midnight Oil's new album as his campaign theme, he'd beat the Republicans in a landslide The song is a sure vote-getter that sounds celebratory for Democrats, ominous for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` Your dream world is just about to end,'' Midnight Oil lead singer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> snarls above chiming guitars that provide the wake-up call. The song, written with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution in mind, is killer rock' n' roll _ hook-filled, dance-inducing and thought-provoking all at once. Happily, the rest of `` Diesel and Dust'' is of the same caliber as `` Dream World,'' and the album could allow Midnight Oil a break into the American market. Until now, the veteran Australian quintet's socially conscious music has n't found much of an audience in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But Midnight Oil deserves to be heard. Its sound reflects five-star bands from other eras, including the Clash and the <ORGANIZATION> Byrds </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> sounds like a world-weary <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Strummer </PERSON>, bassist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON> and guitarists <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moginie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotsey </PERSON> play with both finesse and fire to help create music that is catchy and yet thundering. The band must be great live. And its message is strong. Besides the call to activism on `` Dream World,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> sings about the arms race on `` Put Down That Weapon'' and addresses land rights on `` Beds Are Burning.'' Social concerns have become a more prominent part of pop music in recent years, so there should be room on the charts for Midnight Oil.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Wisecracking Carrie Romps Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Already a film legend as Princess <PERSON> Leia </PERSON> in the `` Star Wars'' epics, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> amazed the literary world last year by producing a book that not only won critical praise, but placement on best-seller lists. `` Postcards From the Edge,'' now released in paperback, is a novel about a film actress, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vale </PERSON>, who enters a rehabilitation clinic to break her addiction to drugs and alcohol. Since <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> is a film actress who almost overdosed in 1985 and underwent 30 days of treatment at a Century City detoxification center, interviewers ask whether the book is based on her life. `` A lot of books are partly autobiographical in nature,'' she replies. `` If you do n't write from what you know, then you're writing science fiction Which maybe I'll try, but then they'll say I'm writing about ` Star Wars.' `` The book is partly autobiographical. I did draw from certain situations in my life, but the book is n't -LRB- autobiographical -RRB-. `` I think it makes people more comfortable to think that it all happened, that I kept copious notes. I've certainly done enough movies, so there's my movie sequence. I was in a clinic. But I could n't have kept notes in that situation; it was too traumatic to keep notes. You're barely there anyway. Most of the other characters are really fiction. It's probably half and half.'' Her next book? `` It's going to be about a girl who is interviewed about a book that everybody says is autobiographical.'' Just kidding, as is her custom. The new book is tentatively called `` Surrender the Pink.'' She says the new book is totally fiction and concerns `` obsessive relationships, or weird love.'' She must deliver it next March. With her newfound discipline, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> is likely to make the deadline. She is now working in `` The ` Burbs'' with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Dern </PERSON>, and she takes her word processor to work with her She is also scheduled to adapt `` Postcards From the Edge'' for a film by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>. But the project has been shelved by the writers' strike The 31-year-old <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> wisecracked her way through an interview at the hilltop home paid for with her `` Star Wars'' earnings. She remarked that she came from `` a long line of short people who are survivors.'' Her parents are <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, stars of a major scandal of the 1950s. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> was too young to remember the headlined events when <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> abandoned <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> for the love of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who ultimately left him for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>. At 17, <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> made her film debut in `` Shampoo,'' graphically propositioning <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>. She dropped out of high school to appear in her mother's nightclub act. At 19, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> chose her to play Princess <PERSON> Leia </PERSON> in `` Star Wars.'' How did she land the role? `` I always like to say that I was in <LOCATION> Schwab </LOCATION>'s drugstore wearing THAT hairstyle when <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> walked in and said, ` What other jerk would look appropriate in space?' `` I just tested for it,'' she said. `` I read well with <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The dialogue was bizarre but I have a weird Pac-Man way of talking that kind of charged through it. They were either going to go for pretty or whatever it is that I have. Which is sort of gritty.'' `` Star Wars'' proved to be the biggest moneymaker up to its time -LRB- 1977 -RRB- and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> appeared in the two sequels. What did the films do for her? `` Well, they made me financially OK _ until I got business managers. They made me a household word, like <ORGANIZATION> Ajax </ORGANIZATION>. Only I was n't a household word. Princess <PERSON> Leia </PERSON> was famous and I was sort of adjunct to her. It's an associated fame, sort of. Once again.'' <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> grew up famous, because of her parents. But she found nothing unusual about her upbringing, nor does she think it contributed to her drug problem. `` What happens -LRB- in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> -RRB- is that you do n't see your parents as much, but it's the same as having working parents,'' she observed. `` So I had working parents, and there were divorces. But that happens everywhere. `` -LRB- Drug problems -RRB- can happen anywhere, too. My brother, <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, had a similar background to me, and he was never a drinker or a drugger. It gets a lot of publicity in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, and maybe it is more part of this environment. But it's everywhere, though mostly in cities. Who wants to take cocaine and sit around and watch the crops fail?''

<HEAD>The Artists: Van Cliburn Returns to the Concert Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In April 1958, a quiet young Texan brought classical music to the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and captivated a nation by winning the <ORGANIZATION> Tchaikovsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competition </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> was the first American ever to win the coveted prize, and he won by playing the explosive and romantic `` Piano Concerto.'' He stopped performing a decade ago to take an `` intermission'' from his hectic concert and recording schedule, and is now returning to the concert stage. `` I love music passionately,'' the pianist said. `` It is my life. But I think of the time necessary to make something ready for the concert stage. It's a lonely procedure and a solitary life. `` A friend said I certainly move at a snail's pace,'' he said with a laugh. `` I do n't want to rush this thing. I do love my audiences. Through the years it has been so heart-warming to hear from people who remembered hearing me and want to hear me again.'' <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>'s first performance since Oct. 1, 1978, was last Dec. 8 at a White House dinner for Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Before he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he promised conductors <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> that he would appear with the National Symphony and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philhamonic </LOCATION>. He also received an award but did not play at a Carnegie Hall concert in June which unveiled the 500,000 th piano built in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by Steinway In September, he will play at the inauguration of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Symphony </LOCATION>'s new hall. And he has been talking to <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, which is releasing his old records as compact discs, about recording again. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> stopped accepted future dates in 1977, intending to give himself about a year's sabbatical. `` When I was young, I told some little friends, ` I feel I will work very hard in the first part of my life,'' he said. `` I want to have an intermission. I want to take the intermission while I'm young enough to enjoy it and get something out of it I feel I will work very hard the last part of my life.''' He began playing piano when he was 3 and made his orchestral debut with the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> when he was 12. The next year he performed at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, made his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Philharmonic debut at 19 and went to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at 23. `` It has been playing, playing, playing,'' he said. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> took his `` intermission'' when he did because both his father and his manager, <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurok </PERSON>, died in 1974. `` I did n't get to spend too much time with my father. Some managers rearranged certain dates so I had a little more time with him at the end. I would n't exchange that for anything. There are certain things in life you never get back,'' he said. <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> received invitations to play but was enjoying his social life too much, so he extended his holiday. Then the White House called on Nov. 17, requesting that <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> play at the Gobachev dinner. `` I was very flattered by the invitation. Then I thought what an interesting and lovely experience it would be,'' he said. `` I had been practicing. ... I was enjoying my work.'' <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON> had given up his long-time apartment across the street from <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and bought a house in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, moving in with his mother, <PERSON> Rildia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cliburn </PERSON>. She was his only piano teacher until he went to the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at 17. `` My mother is my chief critic,'' he said. `` After the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> phone call came, I asked her, ` Do you think I can do it?' She said, ` Well, I do n't know. Let me hear you play a program tonight.' She listened. She said, ` I want to hear this again tomorrow night.' I was practicing feverishly. The next night I played my little program for her. She said, ` I think you can go ahead and call and accept.' She is critical; she makes little suggestions.

She said, ` If you do, you're not concentrating on what you're doing. When you go to the piano, only think of accomplishing something. If you can do something in a short amount of time, fine. Practice until it is what you want.' `` It was terribly providential for me having my teacher in the house, ready to correct mistakes immediately,'' he said. `` Children of parents who are n't trained go to a lesson and it takes another lesson just to correct things.

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Punk-Funk King Has New LP and Label</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN F. BONFATTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AURORA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, the self-professed King of punk-funk rock, calls his latest album `` Wonderful'' with good reason. `` That's the way I feel since I've been off Motown,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON>, referring to the legendary recording label which released the string of singles _ `` You and I,'' `` Super Freak I'' `` Cold-Blooded'' _ that catapulted <PERSON> James </PERSON> to superstardom during the past 10 years. The release of `` Wonderful'' last month on <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>. Records marks a new phase in his career He said his fans will hear `` a joy in it that I have n't had for years.'' `` It's just a very happy album,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who is known for his risque lyrics, throbbing dance rhythms and long curly hair. `` With so many years of unhappiness with Motown, so many of my albums after ` Street Songs,' which was my biggest album, were kind of downhill as far as the ambiance and the joy because I really was n't feeling a lot,'' he said. `` On this album, I kind of got it all back.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> has severed his 10-year relationship with Motown: `` They just did n't allow me to have the freedom that I needed to really make the kind of records and do the kinds of things in the industry that I wanted to do.'' Working at Motown, which produced such stars as the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksons </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supremes </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smoky </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and the Miracles, the Temptations and the Four Tops, was initially invigorating for <PERSON> James </PERSON>. Then the tension between the sexually graphic themes coursing through much of his work and Motown's traditionally conservative approach to pop music began getting to him. `` They never totally understood what I was trying to do, where I was trying to come from with my music,'' he said. `` For the whole 10 years, it was a constant battle in me trying to acquaint them with what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it.'' The parting was not amicable; Motown is suing <PERSON> James </PERSON> for not fulfilling his contracts with them, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> is suing Motown, claiming the company owes him money and never gave a proper accounting of his royalties. Motown `` denies all of that 1,000 percent,'' said company attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottridge </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> denies the charges Motown has made against him. `` They're trying to say I'm in violation of a contract, which I'm not,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON>, adding that he had finished and delivered both his own final LP for Motown and a third LP by the group he produces, the <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION>. During the past three years, <PERSON> James </PERSON> has spent much of his time producing both the artists in his stable _ the <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and Process and the Doo-Rags _ and others, including comedian <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and his successful single, `` Party All the Time.'' He also says that during that time, he's been free of a cocaine addiction that he feels was a serious threat to his life. `` There was a bad period in my life some years ago when I got into a serious cocaine habit; $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 a week,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON>. `` I did n't really see it. My lawyers and my accountants and friends really saw it before I did. They saw that my usage of coke was getting to be a million-dollar-a-year habit. I did n't see it until I went into rehab and I did n't understand it until I got out.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said he got caught up in living the `` bad boy'' persona he had cultivated. `` There was a time where I was just trying to live the image wholeheartedly; I was n't thinking about the person, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I mean, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> was just a man-made image, the image I created. Just trying to live <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> almost killed me.'' He was born <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, Jr. on <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>'s rough East Side 39 years ago. <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who retains the youthful swagger of his earlier years, says his drug rehabilitation made him more patient and less angry. `` I was like the angry young man years ago,'' he said. `` It was n't anything specific. I was angry at the politics of the country. I was angry about the poor people in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. I was angry at bigots and racism. I was angry that the Buffalo Bills were losing. You name it and I'd be angry about it.'' The <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> area remains home for <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who lived for several years in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is crazy; too crazy for me,'' he said. `` I live here because my roots are here. It's very important for me to maintain a strong relationship with my mother and my family and I ca n't do that long distance. It gives me an anchor.'' His house appears to be a modest white ranch from the outside, with only the extra large parking lot and guard booth at the driveway seeming out of character with the <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> neighborhood, an affluent suburb south of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. Inside, he has all the luxuries of a star: indoor swimming pool, basement recording studio and a solarium filled with hand-carved redwood furniture. With his impending re-emergence on the music scene, <PERSON> James </PERSON> is not worried that people wo n't remember him because of his absence from the charts. `` Wonderful'' is his first LP in almost two years. `` I've sold close to 30 million albums,'' he said. `` It's not like 30 million people that bought your music are going to forget about you. I've never really had worries about being forgotten; I've had worries about losing myself in the interim.'' However, with plans for a world tour during the last half of the year, <PERSON> James </PERSON> said he is scared about his return to the limelight. `` I'm horrified,'' he said. `` It's a question of fear of the unknown; of not knowing what -LRB- the reception -RRB- will be.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Brother-Sister Duo Is Newest Family Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sanders have swapped rowdy Alaskan bars for more gentle settings to sing their songs of love. After fighting off grizzly bears and gold thieves in the land of the midnight sun, the brother-sister duo came to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> with their close-knit vocals and launched a country music recording career. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, 33, spent the past 10 years singing in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> at night and often mining for gold by day with their father, a retired geology teacher. `` It was very rewarding,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` It was nice being able to make people smile all the time.'' <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> gave a sample of their experiences: _ `` We played in <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION> in the far northern part. We were hired with 13 Colombians who never went to sleep; they partied nonstop. There were two buckets for the bathroom and a shower stall that said ` girls Monday-Wednesday-Friday' and ` boys Tuesday-Thursday.''' _ `` In <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>, a girl was beating a guy up. She picked up a chair and threw it at him. He ran into the bathroom and hid. He stepped out and she sucker - punched him. _ `` A guy threatened to tie his wife to a tree, so she shot him nine times with a .22 at their cabin. She got on a snow machine and went for help.'' The darkness and remoteness of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> seemed to affect the residents, the <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` In all those remote places where it's dark, people have a tendency to get wild and kick up their heels,'' <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> said. `` It gets depressing.'' `` You get a different breed of people,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>. `` Those who do n't like society go to those type places. It's kind of the end of the road.'' The two also had to contend with bears while mining along the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska-Canada </ORGANIZATION> border. `` We were pretty heavily armed at the mine because they would surprise you or you would surprise them,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said in an interview. `` You'd be in a bind without a weapon. They destroyed our camp a couple of times. One time they walked through a camper-trailer by going in one end and tearing out the whole wall and destroying the inside. They pushed a refrigerator through the wall and made another hole to go out.'' They mined from 1973 until the mid-1980s, always on the lookout for thieves. `` One guy took a chain saw and stole the floor out of a cabin,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said. The two, both born and raised in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, compared the mining business to the entertainment field. `` Some years were good and some were not very good at all,'' <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> said. `` I would n't recommend it for someone who needs security. It's like the music industry. You ca n't count on anything. You work your hardest and hope it works out at the end.'' They recently signed a recording contract with <ORGANIZATION> Airborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, a new independent label in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, an Airborne vice president, had heard them sing several years ago while he was a concert promoter in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. `` One listen and I was sold on their music,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> recalled about his first exposure to them. `` I decided then that if I ever had a label, they would be on it.'' Their first single record is `` You Fit Right Into My Heart.'' Their sound is sure to draw comparisons to the Carpenters, a brother-sister duo who had hits 15 years ago with `` For All We Know,'' `` Superstar'' and `` Rainy Days & amp; Mondays.'' `` We listen to them,'' <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> said. `` But our style of harmony does n't resemble theirs in any way, only that we are brother and sister. We do have kind of a folk influence which they did also.'' `` Our music is kind of on the sweet side but ours is not as sweet as theirs. Ours is more country,'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said. `` We've got a new sound with a different approach. We do n't sound like anyone else. Our music is easy to listen to, positive, straight ahead.'' The Sanders are the latest in a variety of family acts in country music, joining <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatlin </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Gatlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brothers </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- mother and daughter -RRB-, the Forester Sisters, the Whites -LRB- father and daughters -RRB- and others. `` The blend you get when you put family together is going to be closer than if you are not related,'' said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON>, who has two other brothers. `` And you make more concessions when working with family on the road. You have disagreements but you forgive your brother or sister. It's harder to forgive someone not related.'' Said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, `` A lot of families grow up singing and just fall into it.''

<HEAD>Analyst: Domestic Luxury Marques Threatened by Boring Image, New
Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Makers of domestic luxury sedans, already plagued by a dwindling, aging buyer base and a dull product image, likely will lose market share in the next five years to foreign luxury marques slated to enter the domestic market, according to industry consultant <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. Power. In an interview Monday, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> described a December survey of 2,100 luxury-car owners designed to identify the image of 22 luxury marques, including four not yet sold in this country. Image itself is a vague concept of the general perception of a car including its advertising, styling, handling and performance and intangibles such as elegance. <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said the survey revealed a surprising lack of distinctive image among many luxury names; those surveyed recognized only an average of 2.7 marques, including the one they purchased within the 18 to 24 months before the survey was taken. Some luxury cars do have a clear image. <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> particularly are considered elegant, prestigious, enjoyable to drive, well-engineered, contemporary but classically styled and distinctive, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said. But domestic makes overall are seen as conservative, comfortable and unexciting, he said. That is despite individual successes such as <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> division, which has attracted more younger, import-oriented buyers while <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> and Oldsmobile have not <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said image-building is a lengthy and costly process, and may lag behind a marque's actual sales, as with <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. But he said all domestic makers of luxury sedans likely will lose market share in the next five years to new entries such as <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s Infiniti and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus line, both from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and, possibly to <ORGANIZATION> Citroen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Opel </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The luxury car market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> peaked in 1986 with sales of 1.176 million. Power predicted a downturn to 1 million in sales this year, followed by a drop to 969,000 in 1989 and a recovery to 1.186 million sales by 1993. The luxury market's recovery will be fueled partly by the entry of the new marques, he said. Infiniti and Lexus plan to offer six - and eight-cylinder engine coupes and sedans and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s Acura luxury line plans a sedan with an eight-cylinder engine, moving steadily in the arena dominated by the Big Three, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said The new entries will find it easier to create solid, distinctive images for their products because of their specialization and a lack of the poor-quality and look-alike problems that marred domestic nameplates such as <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> and Oldsmobile, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said. Also, while 56 percent of luxury owners age 65 or older said they shop only for domestic models, only 6 percent of buyers younger than 35 said they would not consider imports. And 43 percent of those younger buyers said they did not consider domestic cars at all. As the younger buyers age and move further into the luxury car market, the Big Three will be forced to design with them in mind and move their luxury-marque images in their direction if they hope to lure them away from Japanese and European dealers, <PERSON> Power </PERSON> said. In addition to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s success, Big Three makers have begun improving and modernizing their images by offering sportier two-seat models such as the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allante </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reatta </ORGANIZATION> and the much-delayed <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Turbo Coupe by <PERSON> Maserati </PERSON>. European makers will not be similarly threatened as long as they continue moving their cars upward in price and exclusivity, thus protecting their images, he said.

 Takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> says he still has a myriad of options to pursue despite his defeat in a June proxy fight attempt to win a block of seats on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management on Monday confirmed earlier estimates that shareholders rejected <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s attempt to place himself and four associates on the board. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s dissident slate was voted down by 58.6 percent to 41.6 percent, a much bigger margin than earlier thought. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who owns a 14.8 percent chunk of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock, had conceded defeat after the oil giant's annual shareholder meeting, but had contended the vote was close. There had been speculation <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> was awaiting the exact results to determine how close he came to winning before deciding what to do with his <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> investment. Some Texaco-watchers speculated that a narrow vote might prompt <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> to challenge the outcome or make another attempt to get on the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> board as part of a broader campaign to acquire the company or force a restructuring that would raise the value of his shares. `` We obviously regret that we lost, but hope that management will do as they said and work to enhance stockholder value,'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in a statement issued by D.F. <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm that handled his proxy campaign. `` To answer the many queries concerning our position, there are a myriad of options open to us at this time,'' he said. `` We have not yet determined which one we will follow.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 45.75 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s management stated that <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which tabulated the shareholder votes, reported 85 percent of the company's 242.9 million shares outstanding were represented in person or by proxy at the June 17 annual meeting in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. Excluding <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s stake, all Texaco-nominated directors received 71.4 percent of the shares voted, while directors nominated by the <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> group received 28.6 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said. That gave management an overall victory margin of 58.6 percent to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s 41.4 percent There had been speculation that the fatal blow against <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s effort was the vote for management by the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which had a 4.9 percent stake But the results announced Monday showed management would have won regardless of how <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> had voted. `` This substantial victory margin is the result of widespread support among all <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stockholders,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, said in the company's statement on the results <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> sought board membership as part of an effort to force <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> management to consider his $ 60-a-share cash buyout offer, which valued the company at $ 14.6 billion. <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> called the offer insincere. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who has chased several big companies over the past few years and acquired <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, began building a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> last year while the company was mired in bankruptcy court, a result of its protracted multibillion-dollar legal battle with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s motive of a possible takeover became clearer after <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from bankruptcy court a few months ago He denounced management's handling of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> matter and claimed <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s post-bankruptcy reorganization plan would not maximize shareholder values

<HEAD>GTE To Sell 30.1 Percent Stake In US Sprint To Partner</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is selling most of its stake in the unprofitable <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to its business partner for $ 600 million and may eventually withdraw totally from ownership of the nation's third-biggest long-distance telephone company. The tentative deal announced Monday carries high risks as well as potential gains for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the phone company that is raising its stake in <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> to 80.1 percent from 50 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s share will fall to 19.9 percent at the beginning of 1989, assuming completion of the deal. In a related announcement, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snedaker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s 62-year-old president, said he would take early retirement effective Aug. 15 <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which rates the security of company debt, announced late Monday it was considering a downgrade of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>' debt and an upgrade of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s debt. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is one-fifth the size of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> and is losing money because of the red ink at <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint. <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 138 million in the first quarter of 1988 after racking up losses of $ 800 million last year. The two parents have shared those losses equally. In addition to the huge costs of building a nationwide fiber optic network, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint has a history of billing problems that have cut into revenue. It says the billing problems are largely behind it. Financial analysts say <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>' management has staked the future of the company on the success of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, which is third in the long-distance market behind <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T leads with about 72 to 73 percent of the long-distance market, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> is second with about 10 percent and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> ranks third with about 7 percent, according to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubman </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schelke </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> has turned a corner toward profitability, so <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>' increased ownership is `` a pretty good deal But he said, `` It depends on your view of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s future.'' `` Obviously we believe that the opportunities far exceed the risk,'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> stock closed unchanged at $ 33.62 -LCB- a share, while <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s fell 37 -LCB- cents a share to $ 40 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Monday. In a joint statement, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Both partners came to the conclusion that the 50-50 management arrangement inherent in the present partnership agreement, although important initially in launching <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> successfully, has become an unnecessary burden given the dynamics of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s fast growth and the rapidly changing environment of the long-distance industry.'' <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> formed <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> in July 1986 as a joint venture consisting of <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION>'s own <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>, and some smaller operations. Their projections of profitability for the company proved premature. Last summer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Skibo </PERSON> resigned as president as the company announced a $ 350 million pre-tax charge against second-quarter earnings. <PERSON> Snedaker </PERSON>, who was named to succeed him, had been vice president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON>, the president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION>, will fill <PERSON> Snedaker </PERSON>'s job on an interim basis. Before the end of the year, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunication </ORGANIZATION> will take over day-to-day management of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Esrey </PERSON> issued a statement praising <PERSON> Snedaker </PERSON>, that said: `` We owe him a great debt of gratitude for putting <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s operations back on track.'' Even before its latest move, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> had gone to great lengths to support <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint. In May it announced it was selling its cellular phone operations to <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 772 million, partly to raise cash for <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. The estimated $ 600 million purchase price for the 30.1 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> is based on estimates of the book value of the partnership interest at the end of 1988. Under the deal, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> would have the option, until Dec. 31, 1995, to buy <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s remaining 19.9 percent interest in <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint at book value of Dec. 31, 1988, or at book value at the time of the transaction, whichever is higher. Otherwise, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> would have the option of requiring <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> to buy its remaining interest at any time between Dec. 31, 1991, and Dec. 31, 1995, at the book value prevailing at the time of the transaction. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> provides local phone service, mainly in the Southeast and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. It lost $ 51.5 million on revenue of $ 2.98 billion in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> also gets most of its revenue from local phone service, although it also has data communications, Sylvania light bulbs, specialty manufacturing and consumer communications products. It earned $ 1.12 billion on revenue of $ 15.4 billion last year.

<TEXT>
 Share prices took the largest drop of the year today on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and the dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 251.67-point loser the day before, plunged 513.09 points, or 1.89 percent, closing at 27,149.03 points. It was the largest one-day decline of the key index since December 26, 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> fell 587.50 points. Stock brokers attributed the decline purely to the internal reasons. They said steel and shipbuilding shares, which had supported the market over the past few weeks, finally gave way and led to a decline across the board. <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest shares on the exchange, had risen from the 400's to 750 yen in less than two months, but lost 54 points today. `` I ca n't see any outstanding reason why shares, especially steel shares, fell this much today,'' said <PERSON> Ichitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, a broker at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market seems to have entered a transitional stage. The 500-point drop is a result of an adjustment made for the transition.'' Another stock broker said the plunge without apparent reason indicated steel and ship building shares can no longer sustain the market. `` The market as a whole was not in a good mood in the last two weeks except for steel and shipbuilding shares,'' said <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishida </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today's plunge indicates the end of the steel-led market. Investors have to find other shares they can count on.'' In the foreign exchange market, the dollar, which gained 1.75 yen Monday, closed at 133.85 yen, down 1.30 yen from Monday's close After opening at 134.30 yen, it traded in a range of 133.70-134 .38 yen Currency dealers said early morning speculation on whether the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> would intervene in the market and sell dollars was the major cause of the currency's decline. `` The speculation led to a one-sided selling of the dollar,'' said an exchange dealer at a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 Stock prices fell slightly Tuesday as the market braced itself for another possible rise in British interest rates. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was 2.8 points, or 0.2 percent, lower at 1,846.5 at midday. Trading volume registered a modest 271.2 million shares, compared with 219.5 million shares at the same time Monday. Dealers remained unconvinced that Monday's half-point rise in the British commercial banks' base lending rate to 10.5 percent would be sufficient to dampen inflationary pressures in the economy. However, the pound was able to recover some lost ground which diffused the immediate need for interest rate hikes, dealers said. Reported heavy central bank intervention to cap the dollar's rise, combined with the effects of Monday's sixth rise in interest rates in as many weeks, also helped buoy sterling against other currencies, market watchers said However, amid uncertainty about the near-term direction of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities, buyers were only interested in selected stocks, dealers said.

<HEAD>Pac Bell Proposes Giving up Monopoly on Local Calls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, breaking from tradition, has made a surprise proposal to give up its monopoly on local toll calls in exchange for reduced state regulation. The giant local phone company called its proposal `` the most significant change since the breakup of the Bell System in 1984.'' Under the offer, the company would also expand the local toll-free zone and offer push-button phones without extra charge in exchange for the decreased regulation. If approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the plan would give customers access to high-technology, low-cost services. Consumer representatives greeted the proposal with trepidation. `` My biggest fear is that we will have the pretense of competition but not the safeguards of competition,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gnaizda </PERSON>, a lawyer who represents six minority and low-income groups in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> rate case before the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Others would compete in handling local toll calls, but `` there wo n't be any real competition'' and `` the company will escape effective public and <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny,'' <PERSON> Gnaizda </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s profit will exceed $ 1 billion this year, more than twice its highest level before deregulation, he said The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which has suggested increasing phone company flexibility in the new market created by the dismemberment of the Bell system, will consider all the proposals during the next year. According to <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, the new proposal is more generous than a plan the company presented in January in an attempt to loosen state regulation. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would continue to approve residential rates after 1992, but without the exhaustive, three-year inquiry of <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>'s financial structure. Under the plan, regulatory controls would also be loosened to allow new services to be introduced more quickly. Monthly business rates would be allowed to rise gradually to approach the cost of service. However, rates on premium residential services such as call-forwarding, call-waiting and speed-dialing would be cut. <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said it also would expect reduced local toll rates because of competition.

 <PERSON> Billionaire </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> is waging a bidding war for a lucrative Medicaid contract, taking on <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, the company he founded and steered to a huge share of the automated health services market. EDS, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary since 1984, won the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Medicaid contract in 1976. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosberg </PERSON>, chairman of the board of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the department had not expected another qualified bidder and had begun negotiating with EDS on the financial terms of the pact, until <ORGANIZATION> Perot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> entered the picture. `` We certainly will be there and will bid,'' EDS spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Still </PERSON> said. `` We look at this as a competitor and will treat them as a competitor.'' Under the pact _ EDS assumes data-processing and administrative responsibility for more than $ 800 million in the state's Medicaid program _ EDS could net close to $ 7 million depending in part on performance. <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> founded EDS in 1962 and sold the firm to <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. In December 1986, after highly-publicized conflict between <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> and three other top EDS executives left the computer services company when <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay them $ 850 million. Under terms of the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> buyout agreement, <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> is barred from operating a for-profit firm until after December 1989. <PERSON> Perot </PERSON> built national respect for EDS through health care contracts. Wall Street analysts said <PERSON> Perot </PERSON>'s extensive knowledge of EDS, complemented by the two dozen former EDS employees on his staff, give his firm some competitive strengths. `` <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> and his people ought to know exactly, contract by contract, what EDS has,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON>, a technology analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` They'll know what deals are expiring, what their -LRB- profit -RRB- margins are, and what it'll take to beat them on a bid.

 <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to emerge from nearly three years of bankruptcy protection has won the approval of creditors, stockholders and <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants, but one hurdle remains. At a hearing Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> said he and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>, who are overseeing the case, can not approve the plan unless it contains a provision giving them authority to oversee a trust for <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants. The plan would establish a trust of nearly $ 2.5 billion to satisfy claims by women who allege they were injured by using the Dalkon Shield intrauterine birth control device marketed by <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> in the early 1970s. The plan also would provide for a $ 3.2 billion buyout of the 122-year-old Richmond-based company by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> gave attorneys a week to submit briefs on the proposed revision <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Drebsky </PERSON> told the judges the plan was supported by about 95 percent of the 141,094 <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants who sent in ballots, and by more than 99 percent of the 19 million stockholders who voted. The four banks owed a total of $ 15.6 million by <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> unanimously backed the plan, under which the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> would pay <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' creditors in full. Attorney <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Drabkin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claimants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the plan, which needed the approval of two-thirds of each class of voters, `` provides a just and fair resolution of the case.'' However, attorney <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pittle </PERSON>, who represents several hundred <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants, said the trust fund was inadequate and that more claimants would have voted against the plan if they had been better informed. The plan was difficult for claimants to understand, especially since many of them do not have lawyers, <PERSON> Pittle </PERSON> said. If the judges approve the plan, there will be a 30-day period before a confirmation order is issued. Even if appeals are filed, payments to claimants would begin 30 days after court approval using a $ 100 million fund set up by <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1985 in the face of mounting claims and settlement payments associated with the Dalkon Shield.

 The stock market was mostly mixed today following a sharp drop in share prices earlier in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.

The August contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, fell 30 cents a barrel to $ 15.40 a barrel in the opening minutes of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. That contract had jumped 84 cents a barrel on Monday _ the biggest daily rise since April _ after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it would accept a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in its nearly 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Analysts said an end to the Iran-Iraq war might make it easier for the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> to reach agreement on limiting production in order to boost prices. But analysts also expressed skepticism about the ability of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations and non-OPEC members to end their chronic infighting and overproduction, even if the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war halts. `` This is a very, very hype-sensitive market,'' said <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, senior energy specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. `` Very little has changed here aside from the psychology,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Monday's jump in the August contract was the biggest rise since <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> soared $ 1.01 a barrel on April 11 The price jump was even bigger for the September contract, which rose 92 cents to $ 15.89 a barrel. Monday's jump brought prices back to their levels of earlier this month, before a steep skid in prices took hold because of concerns about a worldwide oversupply of oil. Oil still remains more than $ 1 a barrel below its level of mid-June. Among refined products traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, August No. 2 heating oil jumped 2.15 cents a gallon to 43.27 cents a gallon The August contract for unleaded gasoline rose 1.38 cents a gallon to 51.11 cents a gallon. The rebound in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate brought it back from its recent low of $ 14.44 a barrel last Wednesday and nearly back to its level of $ 15.83 a barrel on July 7. Analysts said crude futures were boosted by traders who had been betting on further declines in prices and rushed to cover their positions by buying contracts. Aiding the rebound in prices was a report that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price monitoring committee would meet within the next 30 days. Part of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s overproduction has been `` war relief'' production by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, which have given the proceeds to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to help in the battle with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knuettel </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A cease-fire could eliminate that source of production, he said In addition, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> might be more willing to support prices instead of punishing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by allowing prices to fall, said <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilacqua </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc But analysts remained uncertain about the outlook for harmony in the fractious cartel. Furthermore, there was skepticism over the possibility that any cease-fire would last. As part of its announcement, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it would not withdraw its troops from its borders and called on Iranians to prepare to thwart further Iraqi attacks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has already accepted the year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution, said it remained skeptical about <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s intentions

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its second-quarter profit climbed 43 percent from a year earlier, reflecting growth in its agricultural, sweetener, chemical and electronic materials businesses. The company said it earned a record $ 220 million, or $ 3.04 per share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with $ 154 million, or $ 1.95 per share, a year earlier. Second-quarter sales rose 11.3 percent to $ 2.26 billion from $ 2.03 billion a year earlier. For the first six months of 1988, net income reached a record $ 430 million, or $ 5.90 per share, up 47 percent from a profit of $ 292 million, or $ 3.71 per share, a year earlier. Six-month sales rose 12.9 percent to $ 4.39 billion from $ 3.89 billion a year earlier. Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> said the results indicate that `` we are making significant progress toward achieving our long range financial goal of 20 percent return on equity by the early 1990s.'' <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> is specializes in pharmaceuticals, agricultural products, specialty chemicals, low-calorie sweeteners, industrial controls and electronic materials. The <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> fueled the growth of second-quarter earnings with significant sales growth of Roundup and Lasso herbicides and <PERSON> Alimet </PERSON> poultry feed supplement, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NutraSweet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also had a strong quarter, reflecting continued growth for products containing the artificial sweetener, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> said. Results from the quarter also included accelerated shipments to certain customers to meet production scheduling requirements. That will likely be reflected in somewhat lower volume shipments in the second half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> said. Its <PERSON> G.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> Controls and <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also showed strong improvements, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Housing construction partially recovered in June, rising 5.1 percent after plummeting 12.6 percent in May, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the increase in housing starts was the steepest in four months. Mortgage rates eased in June, contributing to the revival. On Monday, reports of a possible cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war sent oil prices soaring, while grain and soybean futures plunged following heavy weekend rains in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the August contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, shot up 84 cents a barrel Monday to settle at $ 15.70 a barrel. It was the biggest rise since a jump of $ 1.01 a barrel on April 11. But prices retreated in early trading today. The August contract for <ORGANIZATION> WTI </ORGANIZATION> fell 30 cents to $ 15.40 a barrel. Soybeans for July delivery skidded more than $ 1.09 a bushel, one of the steepest one-day soybean price declines in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. July corn plunged 30 cents a bushel. The spike in oil prices reignited inflation worries on Wall Street and in the credit markets. The concerns were heightened by a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> report that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry in June operated at 83.1 percent of capacity _ its highest point in eight years and edging closer to a level that economists believe signals a pickup in inflation. The nervousness about inflation weakened stock prices. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 23.30 points last week, dropped 11.56 to 2,117.89. Bond prices also fell, forcing interest rates higher. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond jumped to 9.23 percent from 9.14 percent late Friday. The possibility of a breakthrough in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq conflict, along with aggressive dollar sales by central banks, pushed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency to a weaker finish against most key foreign currencies. The dollar historically is regarded as a safe-haven currency during times of unrest, and the prospect of peace between the two <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> enemies spurred investors to sell dollars. The news of a possible cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> alao raised prospects that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would be able to calm its chronic infighting, which has led to overproduction of oil and lower prices. The ensuing price jump in the futures market brought oil back to its levels of earlier this month, before a steep skid in prices sparked by concerns about a worldwide oversupply of oil. Analysts said prices were driven up by traders who had been betting on further declines in prices and rushed to cover their positions by buying contracts. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Monday it would accept a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also said it will not withdraw its troops from its borders and called on Iranians to prepare to thwart further Iraqi attacks.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Sharply Lower On Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Grain and soybean futures opened sharply lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as forecasts for more rain in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> provoked intense selling pressure for the second straight day. Prices on most contracts for future delivery of corn, oats and soybeans plunged their permissible limits at the opening bell, halting trading in all but the limitless July contracts, which expire at noon Thursday. The limit-down opening caused sell orders to pile up. Some 40 million bushels of soybeans and about 50 million bushels of corn were awaiting buyers about 15 minutes after the opening. Weekend showers soaked farm fields in much of the northern Corn Belt, and substantial rains were forecast for the region's southern portion today through Wednesday, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Despite irreversible drought damage to much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop, `` some of it will benefit, and the soybeans definitely will benefit from all this recent rain,'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s latest 6-to-10-day forecast, calling for above-normal temperatures and mostly normal rainfall in the Corn Belt during the early part of next week, was another bearish factor, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 12 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.67 a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents to the limit 15 cents lower with July at $ 3 a bushel; oats were the limit 15 cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $ 2.88 a bushel; soybeans were 18 cents to the limit 45 cents lower with July at $ 8.67 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .45 cent lower to .33 cent higher with August at 64.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 76.40 cents a pound; hogs were .85 cent lower to .63 cent higher with July at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.90 cents lower to .75 cent higher with July at 37.30 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled widely mixed on Monday.

 Stock prices headed lower today as investors remained apathetic toward equities in a market awash in mixed signals. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 14.76 points at 2,103.13 by midday. Declining issues outnumbered advances by almost 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 469 up, 801 down and 524 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 69.09 million shares as of noon on Wall Street. The Dow average moved up about 2 points in the first half hour of trading but then eased back as the session wore on despite continued reports of higher corporate earnings for the second quarter. `` The primary problem is the mood of the market,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` I'm very disappointed with today's action.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knife is one of those products that keeps finding a new market _ from GIs in the foxhole to yuppie campers on a weekend in the wild. And that's good news for a small <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> company that had the good sense to promote the handy pocket tool from forgotten sideline to bestseller. The story of how the <ORGANIZATION> Forschner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> came to be the exclusive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketer of <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knives is a classic tale of serendipity. The company's founders picked up the knife in a search for good European cutlery for butchers. Years later, new owners would move the little red-handled knives to the top of the line. <ORGANIZATION> Forschner </ORGANIZATION> sold more than 4 million of the knives in 1987 alone, accounting for more than half the company's sales. `` It's a good business,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forschner </ORGANIZATION>'s 37-year-old president and chief executive officer The knives, manufactured by the <ORGANIZATION> Victorinox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, are readily identified by their color and many gadgets. The most popular model, with about 500,000 units sold in 1987, is the Classic, a key chain model that has, in addition to a knife blade, a nail file, scissors, tweezers and a toothpick. The latest addition to the more than 60 different models is the SwissChamp, which was introduced this year. It has 29 features, including a ballpoint pen, pliers, wood saw, fish scaler, corkscrew and magnifying glass. The typical customer is a man between the ages of 21 to 35 living in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The weakest sales for the knives are in the Southeast. The company, whose stock is publicly traded, had record sales of more than $ 36.4 million in 1987, up 24 percent from 1986. After expenses, the company earned about $ 1.8 million. The previous record was set in 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> Forschner </ORGANIZATION> rang up $ 27.3 million in sales. The <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knives _ which range in price from $ 8 to $ 18 for the Classic to $ 90 for the SwissChamp _ accounted for roughly $ 20 million of last year's sales. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> snapped up about 35 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Victorinox </ORGANIZATION>'s output of <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knives in 1987 The sales have continued upward despite a more than doubling of the effective price of the knives in the past two years due to the declining value of the dollar, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. Americans got their first exposure to the knives following World War II, when GIs were stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said GIs `` gave the name <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knife to the product ... because everyone in the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> carried it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forschner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> started in 1855 as a manufacturer of butcher scales in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Sometime during the 1880s, it moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where it remained until relocating to <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> in 1976. It currently employs 80 people at its headquarters and a <LOCATION> Shelton </LOCATION> warehouse, where it does some assembly and repairs. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who started with the company in sales in 1975, was named president and chief operating officer in June 1987. He assumed the new title of chief executive officer this March. `` The company after World War I started importing knives from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, because they were selling scales to the meat-packing industry. So, therefore, they could assume the same people would buy knives,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` World War II came along and their German source was naturally unavailable. ... When the war ended, the grandson of the founder went over to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was devastated and found this little company called <ORGANIZATION> Victorinox </ORGANIZATION> that made very good butcher knives and he started importing them,'' he continued. The Swiss Army knife, also made at the Swiss factory, was tossed in for good measure. In 1957, the founding family sold <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forschner </ORGANIZATION> to a businessman who expanded the butcher knife segment and phased out the scale business. In 1974, the business was sold again, this time to <ORGANIZATION> Marline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <PERSON> Marline </PERSON> took the company public in 1983. `` The business was purchased for the butcher knife business. And lo and behold, sitting there in the corner was the litte <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knife,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` We did a market research study of the whole company, and the market research study indicated that we had a great opportunity with the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knife.'' The company turned up its marketing program for the knives in 1976 when it introduced sealed display cases, which are now used by 10,000 retailers to show off 10 to 20 knives. `` It was a very successful program,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` It made it a silent salesman. It's always there in the store. And frankly, ... you do n't get up in the morning and say, ` I'm going to go out and buy a <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> knife.' It's something you know about and if you see it in a store, it reminds you, ` Hey I will want one of those.'''

 After months of leaks, rumors and innuendo about impending mass indictments, the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> securities fraud scandal has yet to result in a triumphant prosecution, raising questions about the true strength of the government's case against suspected Wall Street felons. The apparent weakness stems from the sources of evidence, largely supplied by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> or a few accomplices who have negotiated agreements for leniency in exchange for information about other alleged lawbreakers. That suggests investigators are facing acute problems getting corroboration from more credible witnesses and making sense out of the enormous amounts of material subpoenaed in the probe. The biggest target, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has yet to be formally accused of anything, although it has been the subject of numerous press leaks. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has recommended civil charges of securities-law violations against the firm and some key employees. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has taken an increasingly combative approach toward the crackdown. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> sources, speaking privately, have acknowledged that the firm's senior management is preparing for a legal brawl with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and has briefed lower-level staff on what to possibly expect in the weeks and months ahead. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials have declined to comment on any aspect of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> matter. But people familiar with its investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, have suggested the agency is delaying civil charges because of an incomplete criminal probe of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. If the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed civil charges first, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> would gain wide-ranging access to the government's evidence and witnesses, under the federal rules of pretrial evidence gathering. But <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> would be denied that opportunity if indicted first, because criminal pretrial rules are much stricter. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> is not the only bottleneck in the government's investigation Prosecutors also have failed to bring new charges against three Wall Street professionals arrested with great publicity in February 1987 after they were implicated by a confessed <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> accomplice, merger specialist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. The original charges were dropped in May 1987 because the government said it needed more time to prepare the case against <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigton </PERSON>, trading professionals who were accused of profiting in the stock market on inside information supplied by <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s office promised at the time to obtain broader indictments against the trio in `` record-breaking time.'' Fourteen months later, officials in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office decline to comment on why new charges have not been filed. But the delay suggests that prosecutors, already embarassed once, are reluctant to pursue a case without evidence that is more substantial than <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s testimony. Lawyers for the three men express resentment over the government's handling of their clients, who remain under a cloud of suspicion without formal charges. The lawyers have indicated they will immediately move to dismiss any new charges on grounds they violate the constitutional right to a speedy trial. One indication that the government has progressed in its Boesky-related investigation came earlier this month when a grand jury indicted <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a vice chairman for alleged stock manipulation, based on evidence supplied by another <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> associate and admitted felon, <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>. But securities lawyers have said the prosecutors could face an embarassing defeat without evidence that corroborates <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' testimony They say manipulation is one of the most difficult crimes to prove regardless of evidence. Even if the government triumphs in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case, the results of the Wall Street corruption crackdown have been much milder than first predicted when <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, one of the biggest stock speculators, was arrested in November 1986. He paid the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> a record $ 100 million to settle insider-trading charges and was sentenced last December to three years imprisonment on a single felony count of conspiring to lie to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has yet to testify in any proceeding against others he has implicated. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s lawyers contend his cooperation has exceeded original estimates, resulting in a dozen criminal charges, four guilty pleas and nine <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> administrative actions. In arguing for a reduced sentence a few months ago, the lawyers claimed more indictments would emerge soon, showing `` the extraordinary extent and value of Mr. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s cooperation.''

 Is it a sign of great weakness that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owed $ 368 billion to foreign creditors at the end of 1987, more than was owed by any other nation? Or is it a sign of strength? The popular position is that the `` debt'' is further evidence of a decline of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it is said, is the world's largest debtor nation, the insinuation being that debt is bad. In this instance, however, the debt referred to can also be viewed as strength. There is even a school of thought that declines to call it debt, pointing out instead that much of the money is invested. They ask you to consider this simple equivalent: When you put $ 20,000 into a $ 100,000 house for your family do you explain to your friends that you have just gone deeply into debt, or do you tell them you've just made the best investment of your life? Most people would say the $ 20,000 was invested. And so would any foreigner who put money into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks, bonds and real estate. Such folks invest for a good return. They do n't see themselves as lenders. They really are n't. The popular view of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> being the largest debtor nation comes from a comparison of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments abroad vs. foreign investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is true: Foreigners invest more here than we do there. Do they do so because they lack faith? Or because of the attractiveness of American investments? Does it indicate an Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> with his hand out? Or foreigners eager to get in on good investments? In short, is it debt, or is it investment? Is it weakness _ or strength? While those who call it debt are entitled to do so, others point out that if foreigners buy stock in a company, put money in an American bank, buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities or purchase a production plant, they are investing. It makes sense. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market is the world's biggest by far. The country is also the most politically stable, a factor that has dictated investments as far back as international trade itself. And <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments are inexpensive. It is the latter factor, a direct result of the decline of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, that has been the latest spur to foreign investments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> broker who has arranged at least 70 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments for British companies, offers some succinct reasons for the phenomenon. Despite belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, he says, the British have an island economy. It is a mature economy in which successful companies long ago carved out their niches. The result: `` They butt heads in a small market.'' They look for ways to expand, especially if they have good cash flow, and they see the biggest market of all in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ growing, evolving, changing and, to boot, English-speaking. English laws discourage dividend distributions, a situation that produces problems for good companies. They must expand, and what better place to do so than in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where, because of the devalued dollar, businesses are available at a discount? There is another side of the coin. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> economy is so attractive to foreigners, why should n't it be equally so to Americans? That is, why should they have to send their money abroad?

 Prices fell Tuesday in a quiet session on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market digested Monday's half-point rise in the British commercial banks' base lending rate. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index dropped 4.5 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 1,844.8. Volume rose to a moderate 447.7 million shares, compared with Monday's 366.4 million shares. Dealers said British equities ignored developments on Wall Street until about the last hour of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealings, when a key market indicator in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> abruptly fell about 15 points. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 14.94 at 2,102.95 as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading ended. Players were still preoccupied by concerns that Monday's half-point rise in the British commercial banks' base rates to 10.5 percent would be insufficient to curb inflation, dealers said However, sterling rose on the foreign exchange markets, diffusing the immediate need for an interest rate hike, dealers said. Meanwhile, amid uncertainty about the near-term direction for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities, buyers were only interested in selected stocks, dealers said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday its profits fell in the second quarter, while <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported gains. <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> reported a 4.8 percent drop in after-tax profit to $ 79 million, or 62 cents a share, down from $ 83 million, or 64 cents a share, in the same period last year.

Times Mirror, which publishes the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> among other publications, attributed the drop in earnings to weakness in advertising and higher costs of newsprint. For the first half of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 154.1 million, or $ 1.20 a share, which was up from $ 141.2 million, or $ 1.09 a share in the first half of 1987. Revenue rose to $ 1.6 billion from $ 1.5 billion. Time, with interests in magazines and broadcasting, said its profit rose 7.7 percent in the second quarter to $ 84 million, or $ 1.45 a share, from $ 78 million, or 1.30 a share, in 1987. Revenue advanced 5.8 percent to $ 1.1 billion from $ 1.04 billion. For the first six months, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> had earnings of $ 150 million, or $ 2.58 a share, compared with of $ 124 million, or $ 2.06 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 2.17 billion from $ 1.98 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its second-quarter profit climbed 31 percent to $ 63.6 million, or 84 cents a share, from $ 48.6 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent to $ 613 million from $ 559.3 million. <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, which publishes newspapers and owns broadcast stations and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION> baseball team, said earnings for the first six months totaled $ 95.8 million, or $ 1.26 per share, compared with $ 65.2 million, or 82 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue increased to $ 1.13 billion from $ 1.04 billion.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is talking with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> about selling <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> trucks through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> dealers in a reversal of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s president said Tuesday <PERSON> Norimasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Furuta </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> plans to introduce a sporty Japanese-built minivan this fall and will decide by the end of the year whether to build an engine plant at <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, where its assembly plant opened in September. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> owns 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and receives more than half of the cars produced at Flat Rock _ which was built on the site of a closed <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> metal casting plant. The engine plant would be part of an effort to increase the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> content of cars made at Flat Rock to 75 percent by 1991, <PERSON> Furuta </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> expects to sell 270,000 imported and domestic cars and 100,000 trucks in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during 1988 and eventually wants to sell 500,000 vehicles a year here. Ironically, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> compact pickups before <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> developed its own small trucks earlier this decade. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> also supplied <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> first with small cars and then began sharing development with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, as with the new Probe _ designed by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, engineered by <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, built by <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> at Flat Rock and sold by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> dealers. A second version of the car, the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> MX-6, is sold by <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> dealers. `` Now our relationship has reached the stage where there may be the opportunity in some future programs for the historical roles to be reversed,'' <PERSON> Furuta </PERSON> said. `` Ford could supply <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> with components and could build vehicles for <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> to sell ... entering a new age of true reciprocity.'' <PERSON> Furuta </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> is talking with <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> on a wide variety of subjects including the possibility of selling <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> compact pickups through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> dealers because of the strength of the Japanese yen and the 25 percent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> duty on Japanese pickups. Other small pickup alternatives could include assembling the pickups in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> from U.S.-made parts _ which would not be subject to the duty when the trucks were shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> confirmed the discussions on sale of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> trucks through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> dealers but said he was unfamiliar with the possibility of selling <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> components for assembly in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Ford Probe is selling so fast that `` Ford is requesting that we reach full capacity at Flat Rock as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Furuta </PERSON> said. Production at the plant is being accelerated slowly to keep quality under tight control. At full capacity, the plant can make 240,000 cars a year, but <PERSON> Furuta </PERSON> said it could build 300,000 cars a year without additional investment and will do so if demand remains strong. More than 60 percent of the cars built at Flat Rock are Probes. The plant's production was sold out through the end of the year shortly after large-scale production began. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said both <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> would like to see more cars coming out of Flat Rock, but neither would be willing to compromise the quality of vehicles built there.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the bottler spawned by <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday its profit rose 16.9 percent in the second quarter on an 18.3 percent gain in revenue. The Atlanta-based company attributed the gains to increased volume, improved operating effiencies and the inclusion of recently acquired bottling companies in the results. The company was formed in 1986 out of Coca-Cola-owned bottling operations and is 49 percent owned by <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> said its volume in cases rose about 22 percent in the second quarter and 19 percent in the first half, largely because of acquisitions If all acquisitions of bottling operations in 1987 and 1988 had occurred at the beginning of 1987, volume would have increased about 9 percent in the second quarter and 6 percent for the six-month period. The company issued $ 250 million in preferred stock during the second quarter. Because of the dividend payments on that, net income available to common shareholders rose 11.4 percent, less than the overall rise in net income. Net income rose to $ 41.0 million in the second quarter from $ 35.1 million. Net income available to common shareholders rose to $ 39.1 million, or 28 cents a share, from $ 35.1 million. Revenue rose to $ 1.10 billion from $ 929 million in the second quarter and rose 16.8 percent to $ 1.95 billion from $ 1.67 billion in the first half.

 Prices for some corn and soybean futures contracts closed down their permissible limits Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts for more rain in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. But analysts said that after two consecutive days of limit losses, the markets appeared to have discounted all the rain that the Corn Belt is likely to receive this week. `` I think we'll have a two-sided trade tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We'll probably open lower but not necessarily.'' Oat futures also closed lower but wheat futures advanced on expectations of new export business, analysts said. The wet-weather pattern that drenched parts of the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> over the weekend continued on Tuesday, bringing rain to the region's parched southern and western portions. More rain was expected in the northern Corn Belt on Wednesday. The rain halted further deterioration of the badly damaged corn crop and greatly improved the prospects for good soybean yields, analysts said. At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 8 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.75 -RCB- a bushel; corn was the limit 15 cents lower to 4 cents higher with July at $ 3.08 a bushel; oats were 13 cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $ 2.90 a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents to the limit 45 cents lower with July at $ 8.73 a bushel

<TEXT>
 Two of the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone holding companies reported divergent second-quarter results Tuesday as <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> announced a 27 percent profit gain while <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings fell 14 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and parent of five <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> phone companies in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, said the sale of its Canadian cellular telephone holdings and strong growth in its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mobile phone business helped boost its results. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 351.5 million, or $ 2.58 per share, for the three months ending June 30, compared with $ 275.8 million, or $ 1.96 per share, for the same period a year ago. Revenue for the quarter increased 4.6 percent to $ 2.48 billion from $ 2.37 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. Net income for the first six months of 1988 totaled $ 646.6 million, or $ 4.73 per share, compared with $ 564.8 million, or $ 3.99 per share, for the same period a year ago. First-half revenues totaled $ 4.89 billion compared with $ 4.67 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> is the holding company for <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies serving <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and parent of <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and some smaller subsidiaries, said it earned $ 212.9 million, or 71 cents a share, down from $ 248.8 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.8 percent to $ 2.03 billion from $ 1.89 billion. For the first six months of the fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> fell 11.3 percent to $ 431.6 million, or $ 1.44 per share, from $ 486.5 million, or $ 1.62 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 4.03 billion from $ 3.76 billion. The weaker earnings were in line with expectations and were related to the expense of shutting down Silver Pages operations, the cost of acquiring new cellular and paging properties, and increases in telephone company expenses, the company said. `` We remain confident of our ability to produce earnings growth for the year,'' <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement.

<HEAD>Aerospace Firm Posts Profit of $21.9 Million in 2nd Qtr.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted a profit Tuesday of $ 21.9 million in the second quarter, compared to a $ 15.4 million loss a year earlier, when the company took a large write-off on a secret project believed to be the Stealth bomber. The aerospace company reported that its sales for the quarter fell 5.2 percent to $ 1.35 billion from $ 1.42 billion in the second quarter of 1987. In the first six months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>'s profit climbed to $ 161.5 million, or $ 3.44 a share, compared with $ 25.2 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Six-month revenue fell 4 percent to $ 2.71 billion from $ 2.83 billion a year earlier. The company attributed the improved second-quarter results to absence of a $ 124.3 million write-off it took in the second quarter of 1987 on a project it has n't officially identified, but which is widely believed to be the B-2, or Stealth bomber. Earlier this year, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged for the first time the company is developing the bomber, which is designed to be difficult to detect on enemy radar. Second-quarter operating profit was cut by lower revenues on the unnamed classified program, as well as by reduced sales and lower profit margins on guidance units for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s MX missile and other military projects. Revenue also was reduced because of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> policy that requires contractors to pay a larger share of research and development costs that they previously did, the company said. Production of inertial measurement units for the MX has lagged behind schedule, but the company says it now is producing the units on a schedule acceptable to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The government is withholding less than $ 50 million in progress payments on the MX systems, down from a high of $ 145 million in December 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> is one of three <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> aerospace companies whose offices were searched last month in the nationwide investigation of allegations that defense industry consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for information to help win contracts. The company has said it is cooperating in the probe, which so far has centered on independent industry consultants and former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials.

 Stock prices sank today amid computer-driven sell programs and investor nervousness following a sharply lower markets overseas.

<HEAD>Citicorp, Wells Fargo, Mellon, Irving Post 2nd-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Four of the nation's largest banking companies on Tuesday reported profits in the second quarter in contrast with steep losses a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> noted that the second-quarter losses in 1987 stemmed from additions to loan reserves for potentially uncollectible loans to developing countries. <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> thrifts, said its second-quarter earnings jumped 22 percent _ to $ 64.7 million, or 50 cents a share, from $ 53 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank holding company, said it earned $ 359 million, or $ 1.03 a share, compared with a loss of $ 2.6 billion in the second quarter of last year. If the loan-loss provisions had n't been made, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> said, it would have earned $ 285 million, or 93 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> attributed the improvement in the latest quarter to continued strength in its core banking businesses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. Much of the momentum in banking came from <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>'s credit card business, the company said. The banking giant also credited positive results from securities and currency trading during the quarter, as well as gains from venture capital loans. In the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> posted net profit of $ 717 million, or $ 2.04 a share, compared with a net loss of $ 2.3 billion in the first six months of 1987. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION>, the 11th-largest <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> company </ORGANIZATION>, reported second-quarter earnings of $ 124.4 million, or $ 2.24 a share, compared with a net loss of $ 293.7 million a year earlier. Excluding the provision for risky loans, <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> would have earned $ 83.6 million, or $ 1.45 a share, in the second quarter of last year. The company said an increase in net interest income, resulting from favorable market conditions in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was a major factor in the second-quarter improvement. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON>, which acquired <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in May, is the third-largest banking company in the state. In the first half of the year, the bank posted net profit of $ 244.8 million, or $ 4.39 a share, compared with a net loss of $ 215.4 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and the 16th-biggest bank company, posted net income for the latest quarter of $ 28 million, or 75 cents a share, as opposed to a net loss of $ 566 million a year earlier. For the first six months of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 53 million, or $ 1.40 a share, compared with a net loss of $ 626 million in the 1987 half. New York-based Irving, the 24th-largest bank company and the long-time target of a hostile takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it earned a record $ 169.9 million, or $ 8.85 a share, compared with a net loss of $ 142 million in the second quarter of 1987. In the first half, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> had net income of $ 222.3 million, or $ 11.56 a share, compared with a net loss of $ 113.4 million a year earlier. Great Western Financial, based in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the 22 percent rise in its second-quarter earnings reflected solid performances by each of its core businesses, including continued growth in lending. By contrast, earnings in the first half fell 14.8 percent _ to $ 121 million, or 95 cents a share, from $ 142 million, or $ 1.11 a share, a year earlier. The company said its results benefitted from exceptionally strong gains from sales of home mortgage loans in the first six months of 1987.

 The dollar slumped in foreign exchange Tuesday after the central banks of several nations entered the market to force the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency lower. Gold prices rose sharply in domestic trading in response to a rally in the silver market. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 445.75 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $ 8.25 from late Monday. Dealers said the dollar fell as the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> and West German and Swiss central banks entered the market in the second consecutive day of intervention against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, vice president of foreign exchange at <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said traders sold the dollar because of the aggressive tone of the intervention. Dealers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said the intervention was not large but was significant because the central banks seemed to be trying to push the dollar down rather than just restrain its rise. Some of Tuesday's decline was due to profit-taking after the dollar's surge over the last eight weeks, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a first vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said interest rate hikes overseas, which he said are unlikely to be matched in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during an election year, gave strength to other currencies and contributed to the dollar's decline On Monday, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s commercial banks raised their base lending rates for the sixth time since early June. The dollar closed sharply lower against the British pound on Tuesday. The pound rose to $ 1.70385 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with $ 1.6745 late Monday. In earlier <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading, sterling rose to $ 1.6937 from late Monday's $ 1.6693.

 The stock market skidded lower Tuesday as investor nervousness over the direction of interest rates overrode a flurry of favorable corporate earnings reports. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell more than 11 points on Monday, dropped another 20.63 to close at 2,097.26. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 517 issues up, 918 down and 492 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> was 144.11 million shares, down from 156.21 million in Monday's session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 168.11 million shares. Stock prices were mixed at the opening of trading but soon headed lower. By midday the Dow sank below the psychologically important 2,100 mark and continued to hold at depressed levels despite repeated reports of higher corporate earnings for the second quarter. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, noted that higher interest rates overseas coupled with fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may also hike rates in this country `` is the principal reason making the market nervous.'' He said the market largely discounted repeated double-digit corporate earnings increases for fear `` they will be neutralized by higher interest rates ... down the road.'' The technology sector, which typically has been a leader in propelling the market to higher levels, was particularly weak. `` It can be a little depressing -LRB- elsewhere in the market -RRB- when you see that group give ground,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. With the technology sector down, computer-driven sell programs kicked in and further depressed stock prices. Noting that the market is continuing to lose momentum, some analysts remarked on a sense of apathy among investors and a mood that is negative toward equities. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said investors `` are hesitant to hold on amid even the slightest weakness, rather than ride a correction through.'' He attributed the `` near-sighted behavior'' to residual trauma from last October's stock crash. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the key Nikkei 225-share index plummeted more than 500 points to its lowest level this year. But because the drop largely was a reaction to Monday's sharply higher oil prices, traders said it did not take a toll on domestic trading. Among technology issues, <ORGANIZATION> Seagate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> plunged 5 -LCB- to 13 following a sharply lower earnings report. It was the most active issue in over-the-counter trading, and one trader said <ORGANIZATION> Seagate </ORGANIZATION>'s decline affected other companies in the industry because it provides parts to other computer makers Elsewhere in the technology sector, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which introduced new computers and personal software Tuesday, fell 1 -RRB- at 124; <ORGANIZATION> NCR </ORGANIZATION> fell 3 -RRB- to 58 \; Prime Computer was off \ at 15 and National Semiconductor was off \ at 11 Among other actively traded <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> was down -RCB- at 24 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> was up 4 at 58 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was off | at 45 |, and <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 34 As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 17.18 billion, or 0.64 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index was off 1.03 at 151.80. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 2.52 to 310.18, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was off 2.04 at 268.47. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index fell 0.69 to 308.39. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market closed at 391.28, off 3.49.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Plunge Again As Rain Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Rainy weather brought another sharp drop in corn and soybean futures prices Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and some analysts wondered if the Midwestern drought had finally been quenched. On other markets, silver futures soared to a 10-month high; energy futures fell; livestock and meat were mostly lower; and stock-index futures retreated. The wet-weather pattern that drenched parts of the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> over the weekend brought rain on Tuesday to the region's parched southern and western portions. More rain was expected in the northern Corn Belt on Wednesday. Analysts said the rain halted further deterioration of the badly damaged corn crop and greatly improved the yield prospects for soybeans, which are just entering the critical pod-forming stage. Some corn and soybean contracts plummeted their permissible limits in reaction to the rain, and analysts said that after two consecutive days of limit losses, the markets appeared to have discounted all the rain in sight for the Corn Belt. `` I think we'll have a two-sided trade tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We'll probably open lower but not necessarily.'' <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said the weather would continue set the market's course and <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an assistant vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, agreed `` Last week a lot of people bought soybeans at $ 9 thinking they were going to go to $ 13,'' she said. `` Now they're thinking, ` My god, what if we continue to get rain?'. `` It could be that the drought's broken,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said. `` Sure, we need 10 to 15 inches of rain in most areas to bring the soil moisture back to normal ... but at least we're not seeing further deterioration in the crops.'' Although it was uncertain how much rain the western Corn Belt would receive overnight, Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said the price drop of the last two days probably had taken a substantial rainfall into account. Oat futures also finished lower but wheat futures advanced on expectations of new export business, analysts said. Wheat settled 6 cents to 8 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.76 a bushel; corn was the limit 15 cents lower to 5 cents higher with July at $ 3.08 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 14 cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $ 2.90 a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to the limit 45 cents lower with July at $ 8.74 -LCB- a bushel. The price for July delivery of silver soared more than 57 cents on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to $ 7.727, the highest price for near-month delivery since Sept. 10, when the September contract closed at $ 8. Analysts cited a number of factors for the rise, including the two-day old Peruvian silver miners' strike and growing investment demand for silver as a hedge against inflation. World supplies of silver are plentiful and the strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, which accounts for about 20 percent of world production, normally would have little long-term effect on prices, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` If investment demand were not picking up, the fact that the supply is being disrupted from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> would not have a large impact'' on the supply-demand scenario, he said. A bullish technical picture also spurred buying of silver, which helped boost prices of other precious metals, other analysts said. Gold settled $ 8.70 to $ 9.80 higher with August at $ 447.50 a troy ounce; silver was 57.7 cents to 62.5 cents higher with July at $ 7.727 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders grew skeptical that a possible cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war would soon reduce the world oversupply of oil, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 47 cents lower with August at $ 15.23 a barrel; heating oil was .37 cent to .65 cent lower with August at 42.90 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .46 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 50.65 cents a gallon. Lower cash values pressured cattle futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while pork futures fell on expectations of weakening cash prices, analysts said. Live cattle were 1.18 cents lower to .23 cent higher with August at 63.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .68 cent lower with August at 76.10 cents a pound; hogs were .80 cent lower to .48 cent higher with July at 46.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .70 cent to 1.20 cents lower with July at 35.85 cents a pound. The contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index settled 1.85 points lower at 270.45 on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had agreed to participate in a $ 500 million, short-term bridge loan to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlements </ORGANIZATION>, an organization in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> of the world's central banks, also is participating, the department said in a statement. A <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation would amount to about half of the loan, which must be repaid by Dec. 30. It is intended to tide <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> over until an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> loan is disbursed later this year. <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s finance minister, recently told bankers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that this month his country will pay foreign commercial banks the interest it owes them for June and July, bringing it up to date for interest due from the beginning of the year. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and a committee of its major creditor banks reached an agreement last month to end a moratorium on interest payments begun by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in February 1987. The agreement calls for the rescheduling of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s $ 62 billion debt to foreign banks and the issuing of $ 5.2 billion in new loans. The nation's total foreign debt of $ 120 billion is the biggest in the developing world. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> also is taking steps to restrain inflation and curtail its government deficit. `` <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> participation in this multilateral effort indicates our strong support for <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s economic reform efforts,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement said.

<HEAD>Honeywell Posts 41.8 Percent Profit Drop In Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday posted a 41.8 percent drop in its second quarter profit from a year earlier, due mainly to $ 43 million in one-time charges and to accounting changes. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> said its net income fell to $ 31.6 million, or 75 cents a share, from $ 54.3 million, or $ 1.21 a share, in second quarter 1987. Sales in the three months ended July 3 rose to $ 1.75 billion from $ 1.57 billion a year earlier. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Renier </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the defense contractor and maker of building controls, said quarterly results reflected a $ 27 million after-tax charge related to cost overruns on fixed-price contracts in the military avionics group and a $ 16 million charge to cover losses in a semiconductor product line. The military avionics group also suffered a reduced asset value under more stringent accounting rules, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eich </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman. `` With the exception of the previously announced charges in our military avionics group, performance in our other major businesses remains strong, with increases in both sales and operating profit,'' <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Renier </PERSON> said operating profit was up in the following divisions: industrial automation and control, defense and marine systems, home and building automation and control, and international business. Six-month net income was $ 89.3 million, or $ 2.11 a share, down from $ 98.0 million, or $ 2.17 a year ago. Total sales for the first half of 1988 were $ 3.48 billion, compared with $ 3.05 billion in 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, undergoing a federally-assisted bailout, reported Tuesday that it lost $ 758 million in the second quarter, citing deteriorating values on real estate assets and foreclosed properties. `` As forecast at the annual meeting of shareholders last month, the second-quarter losses were substantial,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. The company had lost $ 313.2 million in the second quarter a year ago. During the first quarter of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> recorded a $ 1.5 billion loss, and its loss for the six months ending June 30 was $ 2.26 billion. First RepublicBank's first quarter loss, the largest ever for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank after <ORGANIZATION> Citcorp </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2.5 billion loss in 1987, forced the company to launch an emergency federal recapitalization plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in May infused $ 1 billion into the holding company, formed through the merger of <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in May 1987. For purposes of comparison, the company said it had a loss of $ 302.8 million for the first six months of 1987. lost The holding company attributes its latest loss to deteriorating values on real estate held as loan collateral and repossessed properties which it is unable to resell `` The market is very, very soft,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON>, First RepublicBank spokesman. It said its nonperforming assets totaled $ 5.135 billion, up $ 671 million from the quarter ending March 31. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said in a statement that declining values of its real estate slowed slightly in the second quarter. `` I clearly can not report, however, that we have reached bottom at this point,'' he said. The company's recapitalization plan is under examination by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> said the second quarter earnings report would not affect the agency's acceptance of it. `` We've kept the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and other regulatory parties fully apprised,'' <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> said. The plan was submitted last month with several other proposals and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> was expected to choose a plan for the company this month. `` We had hoped for a favorable decision on our plan by now, but the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has required additional time to study all available options,'' said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. `` We remain confident that the <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> plan is the most viable of those options and will ultimately be accepted.'' Company officials now expect a plan to be chosen within a weeks.

 Beretta, the Italian arms manufacturer, sued <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 250 million Tuesday, claiming its centuries-old reputation for fine workmanship will be ruined if the carmaker continues producing a four-wheeled Beretta. <PERSON> Fabrica </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Armi </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> SpA, maker of firearms since the late 15th century, charged <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> with trademark infringement and unfair competition in a federal lawsuit. Beretta, which calls itself `` the oldest manufacturer of arms in the world,'' said its lawyers warned <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> about using the Beretta name a year before the automaker unveiled the Chevrolet model in 1987. The arms maker, based in the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Brescia </LOCATION>, said the company had registered trademarks in this country for the <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> name as far back as 1954. In <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement that said `` no basis for the suit exists because there is no likelihood for confusion as to the source of those vehicles between <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and the Beretta gun company.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employee who selected the Beretta name was unaware of the existence of the Beretta gun company. Moreover, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it is not uncommon that vehicle models and firearms have the same names, such as Colt and <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is not aware of any customer confusion concerning the Beretta name,'' the statement from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said. The Italian concern, which makes luggage, clothing, cutlery and optical equipment as well as target, hunting and military guns, claimed that for the past four centuries its products `` have become synonymous with refined workmanship and the very highest quality.'' The lawsuit contends Beretta pistols are the standard military sidearm in several countries. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> signed an $ 80 million contract for 315,000 Beretta pistols in 1985, but has been forced by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to hold a new competition among pistol companies for its next order. Other examples of the gunmaker's reputation can be found in literature, where the Italian-made pistols are the weapons of choice for numerous fictional spies and detectives, including <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s Agent 007 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has set up a new state bureau to oversee efforts to reduce the number of shoddy, substandard goods on the market and help Chinese products meet international quality standards, an official daily said Wednesday.

He said that since <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> initiated its economic reforms and open-door trade policy in 1979, the country has put into effect more than 11,000 state standards and 500 measurement regulations.

 <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> received another setback Tuesday in its attempted hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, as <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s state insurance director rejected the proposed acquisition. Regulators in nine states where Farmers has offices must approve the proposed $ 4.5 billion, $ 63-a-share offer, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> already have rejected the buyout plan. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, filed an appeal in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and was expected to appeal in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagiano </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, stated that Farmers in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> hearings had cited a threat to the maintenance of its <LOCATION> Pocatello </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, regional office and the possible adverse effect on the southeast <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> economy if the office was closed. Farmers also cited its record of providing competitive medical malpractice liability insurance for <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> hospitals. `` While <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> officials did not assert they would close the Pocatello office or discontinue medical malpractice liability insurance for hospitals in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, their commitment contained significant reservations in the Director's view,'' <PERSON> Fagiano </PERSON>'s statement read <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky.-based <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement that it was confident it could allay <PERSON> Fagiano </PERSON>'s concerns and would immediately him to `` discuss with him the appropriate assurances on these points.'' <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> has approved the takeover, and hearings have begun or decisions are pending in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. A hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before that state's insurance commissioner continued Tuesday, and another is planned in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Attorneys for Farmers and its exchanges say <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> could make any number of changes onces it takes over as sole owner, including saddling Farmers with a $ 1.6 billion acquisition debt. During the many hearings, Farmers attorneys have cited recommendations made to <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> by consultants it hired last year, recommending that <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> eliminate Farmers' life and medical malpractice insurance policies and its discounts for non-smokers. They also say <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> could hike premium rates and shut down claims offices. But <PERSON> Batus </PERSON> has promised not to change Farmers management and to let the company operate as it has. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION>, which would borrow $ 3.2 billion of the $ 4.5 billion acquisition cost, claims its parent company has such good credit that it does not need collateral and does not need a backup plan in the event later loan refinancing requests are denied. <ORGANIZATION> Batus </ORGANIZATION> has more than 40,000 employees in its subsidiaries and ranked in the top 100 corporations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year with $ 5.8 billion in sales.
