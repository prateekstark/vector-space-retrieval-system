<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Machinists are returning to the bargaining table Saturday, the 46th day of a strike that's idled production lines at the world's biggest commercial airplane builder `` I just felt it is time to get them back to the bargaining table,'' federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said of his call for the meeting. The face-to-face talks, which broke off Nov. 4, were set for 1:30 p.m. at <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>'s offices. Meanwhile, the union representing engineering workers for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> agreed Friday to extend its present labor contracts beyond their Dec. 1 expiration dates while negotiations continue. The contracts cover nearly 28,000 workers, who are represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Agreement on the engineers' and professional workers' pacts, however, is not expected until there is a settlement in the Machinists' strike. While both <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the Machinists welcomed new talks, the union warned `` continued stonewalling by the company would lead to a continuation of the seven-week-old strike.'' The previous talks broke off after union leaders rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> offer that had a new look but the company conceded included no new money. The union accused <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> of trying to build up workers' hopes, then forcing a membership vote. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> declined to say whether there was any change in either side's position. `` Our objective all along has been to get the 57,000 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees back to work and the fact the meeting is called is hopefully a sign that we can get them back to work,'' he said. The strike, which began Oct. 4, on Saturday it becomes the second-longest strike in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s history, surpassing a 1977 work action that lasted 45 days. The longest, in 1948, lasted 140 days. The latest three-year offer from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> included annual wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent; annual bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay, 4 percent and 4 percent; a reduction in mandatory overtime from the current 200 hours a quarter to 144 hours by mid-1990, and across-the-board increases in retirement benefits. Machinists represent 57,000 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers, including 43,000 in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others at scattered sites in other states. Work on production lines has been severely curtailed by the strike, though <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has said it is continuing with help of supervisory personnel and a few thousand machinists who crossed picket lines.

<TEXT>
 Rats devour or destroy nearly a half-million tons of grain in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> each year, enough to feed at least 3 million people in this impoverished nation, a newspaper said. The destruction begins in farms and continues up to the dining table, the Bengali-language newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Dainik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bangla </ORGANIZATION> said Friday, quoting agricultural experts. The rats destroy about 100,000 tons of grain in stores alone. More than 480,000 tons of rice and wheat _ 2.5 percent of the country's total grain production _ is lost to the rodents annually, the paper said. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, one of the poorest nations in the world with an annual per capita income of $ 160, produces about 19 million tons of rice and wheat a year. The nation of 110 million people imports 1.6 million tons to 3 million tons of grain to meet yearly shortfalls. The rat population reaches its peak during November and December when winter crops are harvested. During those months, authorities launch an annual rat-killing campaign.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Swede Guilty of Smuggling Arms to Iran</HEAD>

 A federal jury Friday found a Swedish businessman guilty of smuggling military hardware to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in violation of the federal Arms Export Control Act. The jury also found <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>, 62, guilty of conspiracy and money laundering. He and two Canadians were arrested by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> agents who set up a fake company for the investigation. Jurors found <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON> innocent of three money laundering charges. The jury deliberated all day Thursday and for three hours Friday before reaching a verdict. Prosecutors said he faces up to 27 years in prison and fines of up to $ 1 million when sentenced in January. <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Norrkoping </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, was arrested May 25 and indicted in connection with the alleged conspiracy to ship military jet parts to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> without a proper <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> license. <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>'s alleged co-conspirators, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, 52, both of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to similar charges in October and agreed to testify against <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>. They will be sentenced next month. The three were caught in an undercover investigation by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> agents who set up a bogus business at <ORGANIZATION> Corpus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>. The government accused <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON> and the Arabs of smuggling 13 air pressure control devices for F-4C Phantom jet fighters. The devices were delivered to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in March, officials said. The government said a separate $ 4.7 million deal was in the works when <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON> and the Arabs were arrested. <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON> maintained that he was a legitimate broker and unaware the transactions were illegal. `` Mr. <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON> is one of those persons who saw <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after the revolution -LRB- in 1979 -RRB- as a land of opportunity,'' federal prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> said in his closing argument Thursday. `` He got a copy, one way or the other, of an Iranian wish list.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON>, not <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON>, was the `` con man'' of the alleged scheme.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Recommends Tribal Self-Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials say they realize the federal government has mishandled Indian affairs and welcome a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report that recommends allowing tribes to govern themselves. `` Quite clearly the federal government in the past has not been as efficient, as careful or as caring as it should have been in a number of instances,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary, said Friday. But he said the department already has begun to correct problems identified in a 238-page report released by a special investigating panel of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs. The report summarizes a two-year investigation into government corruption relating to Indians. It recommends that the federal bureaucracy be broken apart to allow tribes interested in self-determination to negotiate for grants from the federal government much the same way as do states and local governments. `` Fraud, mismanagement and corruption pervade virtually all federal Indian programs,'' Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., chairman of the special committee He said the committee's work showed that many tribes are capable of managing their own affairs. He said federal Indian agencies should continue to exist for tribes that want the services, but in time all tribes would see the benefits of self-government, `` assuring that the billions now wasted on self-perpetuating federal bureaucracies will belong to tribes themselves, to determine their own destiny.'' `` In all, the federal budget for Indian programs equals $ 3.3 billion annually. Yet, surprisingly little of these funds reach the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. Under the committee's proposal, the federal government would provide an annual grant to each tribe, equal to the tribe's proportional share of the current federal Indian budget It would be a permanent entitlement, in lieu of federal services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs or other agencies. The tribes would have to be accountable for the funds and tribal officials negotiating the agreements would have to be proven representatives of their tribes. `` I have not yet consulted with <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes about the recommendations contained in this report and will withhold any final comment pending consultation,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION>. But he said he agreed with the report's finding that `` we must take real actions and not merely offer Band-Aid solutions.'' Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Nighthorse </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, D-Colo., the only native American in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, joined <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and Sens <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, in announcing the proposals `` Two hundred years of mistakes in dealing with the American Indian can only lead to more of the same without drastic reform,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. The lawmakers said it would take a long time to put the proposals into action, but that they would draw up legislation soon and that <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs, would hold extensive hearings. Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, D-Ariz., who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he had reviewed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> report and would work with <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> on legislation The special committee, appointed by <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, held more than four weeks of hearings last winter and spring. The committee staff visited more than 70 Indian tribes in 16 states, conducted about 2,000 interviews and analyzed more than 1 million documents. The panel examined contracting fraud, gaming operations on reservations, child sexual abuse in federal schools, protection of natural resources belonging to the Indians, housing, the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and corruption among tribal officials.

 Western novelist <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON> is dead, but he may ride high on the best-seller lists for years thanks to unpublished and out-of-print work. `` We have a couple of full-length novels and we have some -LRB- unpublished -RRB- short story material and we have short story material that was written for the pulps,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON>, the author's wife of 32 years, said recently. `` So we're in good shape and we'll have a publishing program well into the'90s,'' she said. <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON>, a favorite of former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, died of cancer in June 1988 at age 80. The unpublished works are from what he called his `` toxic dump'' _ piles of papers stacked haphazardly on the floor and desk of his workroom. `` I took about seven days of randomly walking around and randomly sampling stuff to try and find if there was any order or not,'' said the author's son, <PERSON> Beau </PERSON>, 28. `` After that week I just decided there was n't any order.'' <PERSON> L'Amour </PERSON>'s `` Education of a Wandering Man,'' published a few weeks ago, is on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> bestseller lists for hardcover nonfiction books.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Abortion-rights supporters say they are setting the stage for next year's congressional battle with a bill that would write into law the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Wade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that legalized abortion. `` This bill is going to be the rallying point,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Claudine </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, R-R.I. Bills were introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that would effectively overcome the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision last summer in the so-called <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case that gave states greater authority to restrict abortions, supporters said. Just a few lines long, the bill would forbid states from restricting a woman's right to have an abortion before the time her fetus becomes viable for life outside the womb, or at any time when necessary to protect the life of the mother. A leader of the abortion opponents, Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.J. </LOCATION>, said he welcomed the bill because it would bring a full debate on abortion. He said he was confident the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would defeat it. `` I hope they bring the bill to the floor very quickly,'' he said. `` The question will then be very squarely: ` Will we permit abortion on demand for the whole nine months of pregnancy?''' Although no action was expected until next year, abortion-rights backers said the bill would become the central focus of future congressional and political debate on the abortion issue. The House bill had 88 sponsors, and a version introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> carried 19 sponsors. The bill was aimed at writing into law the landmark 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision establishing a woman's right to an abortion and at reversing the Webster ruling. Abortion-rights supporters contend the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision eroded rights established 16 years earlier and signaled a possible further erosion in future high court decisions. The <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision, however, has energized abortion-rights leaders and raised the temperature of the abortion debate in many states. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., an abortion-rights supporter, predicted passage by both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but acknowledged backers probably would not be able to override a presidential veto President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is appearing in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Monday at an event for <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, despite their differences on abortion.

 When <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuehrer </PERSON> started regular Monday prayers for peace at his church, Nikolaikirche, back in 1982, he never dreamed they would one day be the kernel of a revolution. Fuehrer, vicar of one of central <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s most historic churches, was one of the thousands of East Germans and millions of West Germans who believed medium-range missiles should not be stationed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to counter Soviet SS-20s. The small peace movement in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> then centered largely on its Protestant church, the only institution in the country independent of the Communist authorities. Fuehrer, a quietly determined 46-year-old father of four, started `` peace prayers'' every Monday. Dozens, even hundreds, came. But once <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> missiles were stationed, Fuehrer recalls, disillusioned East Germans stopped coming to the Monday prayers and attendance sank to just ten. Things changed early in 1988, when East German police arrested dozens of youths bold enough to celebrate in their own way at an official ceremony honoring <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Luxembourg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebknecht </PERSON>, heroes of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s failed communist revolution in 1918. `` Many people came, asking to pray for those who were arrested,'' Fuehrer said in an interview. `` And it was there that I first heard from people with problems, who were waiting to leave the country.'' Then, the wait could take two or three years. People who had applied to emigrate West faced obstacles at work, in schools, even at home. They needed counseling, and they found it in Fuehrer's Nikolaikirche, where the motto is that the church is `` offen fuer alle'' -LRB- open for all -RRB- `` Really, we were a substitute for the state,'' Fuehrer said. `` But the state was not ready for, or capable of any dialogue.'' Despite harassment from the authorities, Fuehrer kept counseling the would-be emigres, and providing shelter for small alternative groups such as those concerned with cleaning up <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s heavy polluted environment. `` Now, I've taken down the posters for New Forum,'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s largest opposition movement, Fuehrer noted. `` They have a place of their own now. My philosophy is, political parties have no place in church. But if they have no other place to go, then the church will offer them protection.'' By May 7 of this year, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s authorities had enough of the Monday prayers. Police cordons were thrown up around the church and everyone who attended was registered. In a sign of mounting popular discontent, however, the repression backfired. Curious passers-by stood behind the police cordons, and gradually became interested in the Monday service, forcing Fuehrer to ask other <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> churches to arrange similar sessions to get people off the street. But the crowds kept growing, irritating the Communist authorities. Under pressure from a mass exodus of tens of thousands of young people through <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the government started to crack down hard on dissent. On Oct. 7, the nation's 40th anniversary, police in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and other cities beat hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators in what Fuehrer saw as a `` dress rehearsal'' for a move against his Monday service and spontaneous marches afterwards. Two days later, the attempt was made. After Fuehrer refused to bow to threats of prosecution, the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sent about a thousand of its members to church. The Communists intended to fill most of the 2,000 seats hours before the service began. Again, the tactic backfired. Fuehrer hurriedly asked two other churches to open for prayer, then went ahead and held his own regular session. What Fuehrer calls the next `` miracle'' of that day occurred during the service. A message arrived from three Communist functionaries and <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>, conductor of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s famed Gewandhaus orchestra, saying they supported peaceful demostrations. This encouraged the congregation to join a crowd of tens of thousands outside in a peaceful march, despite a strong presence of police and special anti-riot forces. `` You had the impression that a world war, or at the very least a civil war, was on its way,'' Fuehrer said of the security forces. `` But in the end there was no violence,'' and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s peaceful revolution was born Now, hundreds of thousands of people seeking free elections march through <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s streets every Monday after the `` peace prayers.'' `` Without the church, the demonstrations would not have been possible,'' Fuehrer noted. `` But we did n't organize them. I never imagined, of course, where the peace prayers might lead.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, steering clear of the controversial subject of German reunification, is making a concerted show of consulting with Western leaders before his shipboard summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The White House issued a statement Friday saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had called French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> on Friday, and had received a call from West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. Another statement was issued later to report <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had called <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and to say they will continue their talks when they meet next Friday at Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, the presidential retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Catoctin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. The leaders talked about the meeting this weekend of European leaders on the fast-moving developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> Dec. 2 and 3 on ships off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, the White House said. The calls seemed designed to ease European concerns that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was going to meet <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> without the benefit of advice from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. Preparing for the summit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to meet at Camp David today with two groups of academic and think-tank experts on Soviet politics and <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also held a round of pre-summit talks Friday, meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with four former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>: <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Toon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>. In a radio interview aired today by Mutual and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside fears about the possibility of German reunification, saying, `` I do n't think history need repeat itself if there evolves a single German state.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said reunification is `` a matter for the people of the Germanies to determine. And it is a very _ it's a highly sensitive matter as far as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is concerned. And it's better to leave it right there.'' The opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall has prompted talk about a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has been divided into East and West since the end of World War II. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said that talk about reunification would mean interference in the affairs of the two Germanies. Moreover, there is nervousness in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> about restoring <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to full strength, since a militarily strong <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was at the center of two world wars in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this century. In another development, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sent a cable to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressing hopes for `` a calm and peaceful period of change'' in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, responding to a virtually identical message from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a week earlier, indicated his support for the dramatic changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and reforms under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. A senior administration official said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not agree at the summit to look the other way in case the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> deems it necessary to crack down against labor unrest and citizens' unhappiness over expected food shortages this winter `` This American president, like his predecessors, will have no understanding for the violent suppression of man's desire for freedom, period,'' the official said, insisting on anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, welcomed recent political changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the formation of a new Cabinet containing 11 non-communist members `` could be a first step'' toward meeting the East German people's demands for democratic reform. She said those demands could not be met fully without free elections. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> also applauded the dismissal Thursday of three hardline Politburo members in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and the installation of four officials who are likely to support new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>. She called it `` an encouraging sign'' that <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> has `` the will and the ability to carry out needed reforms.''

<HEAD>Cable TV Has `Unrestricted Monopoly,' Broadcasters Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cable television companies enjoy an `` unrestricted monopoly'' that lets them overcharge customers and seize control of sports programs, broadcast competitors contend. The criticism came Friday from independent and network broadcasters at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s communications subcommittee on the regulation of the cable TV industry. The broadcasters say cable television operators pay nothing for 72 percent of the programming viewed by their customers because it is supplied by networks and independent stations. At the same time, the broadcasters contend, the cable industry programmers favorably treat the local cable outlets while charging excessive rates to others. Five companies serve 42 percent of cable households in the country and rates rose 29 percent in the first two years of deregulation starting in 1987, according to the critics. In addition, they say, the same companies that produce cable programs also have the cable systems, giving them control of `` conduit and content.'' `` Cable's unrestricted monopoly operations _ its nearly free use of the compulsory license, and its use of a triple revenue stream of subscription rates, advertising and pay-per-view _ has led to a completely distorted marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the networks. The cable industry disputed those contentions, saying rates jumped after being kept artificially low by local regulation. It said rates are now rising at a lower rate than inflation. The industry, through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, also claims that cable helps networks by extending their reach and improving their signals. The cable industry also says it has increased the amount of sports programming available and blames the team owners for jacking up the bids. <PERSON> Fritts </PERSON>' group supports legislation proposed by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., that would re-regulate the cable industry, which was basically de-regulated by the 1984 Cable Act <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>'s bill would allow cities to regulate cable rates unless cable companies had effective local competition and would make it easier for cities to revoke the franchises of cable operators who do not serve the community well. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Padden </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stations </ORGANIZATION>, claimed that cable is monopolizing sports television. He showed the subcommittee a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> billboard warning, `` No Cable, No <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON>, No Cable, No Magic,'' a reference to stars <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> hockey team and <PERSON> Magic </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Lakers </ORGANIZATION> basketball team. He also complained that such sports siphoning was occurring in college conference sports. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McReynolds </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the cable industry group, acknowledged that there have been `` a few instances'' where sports events have been moved to cable.

 Peace talks between the Nicaraguan government and the Contra rebels resume on Monday with the two sides at an apparent impasse over terms for reviving a cease-fire. During the seventh day of discussions on Friday, the Sandinista government remained adamant in its insistence on a full withdrawal of Contra forces from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. For its part, the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> resistance stood firm in refusing to consider even a partial withdrawal of the estimated 5,000 Contras deployed in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> mediators were spending the weekend drafting a revised working document for presentation to the negotiators when they resume their discussions here on Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> suspended the cease-fire on Nov. 1, citing what he described as Contra terrorist activities. He has said the Feb. 25 national elections will go ahead as planned even if no truce agreement is reached. After a two-hour negotiating session Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> warned that a cease-fire in place, as proposed by the Contras, would create in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> a situation similar to that in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> where truces have never taken hold. `` We consider that an effective cease-fire in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> means a separation of forces, and a separation of forces means all the Contras to withdraw with their arms to their camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said. `` Otherwise, there will be no cease-fire.'' Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said such a retreat would leave the rebels at a disadvantage. `` Once our forces have withdrawn from certain areas, the government forces have taken advantage to move there in force, deploy huge amounts of weapons, huge amounts of forces, to repress our civilian supporters,'' he said. After two days of talks at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and five more here, <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> said there are `` substantial differences'' but noted that both sides are willing to continue the negotiations. <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> also ruled out the possibility of reaching a compromise by allowing the Contras to redeploy in designated enclaves inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, subject to international inspection. He said the Nicaraguan terrain does n't lend itself to such a solution because much of the country is heavily wooded and the rebels would have the ability to move in and out of the enclaves undetected. The enclave concept, he said, `` has never functioned in human history.'' <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Zela </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> resorted to understatement in characterizing the status of the talks. He said there are `` some discrepancies'' between the two sides. But, he added, `` the fact that we are continuing signifies progress.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says Torture, Political Repression Rising in El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report says <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s government presided over a `` resurgence of torture'' this year that included sexual abuse and beatings of prisoners and summary executions of political opponents The annual report was released Friday, a day after eight people, six of them Jesuit priests, were slain in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridruejo </PERSON>, special representative of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in the report he `` is again extremely disturbed by the number and seriousness of the human rights violations committed thus far in 1989, particularly by the resurgence of torture. `` Members of the state apparatus, particularly of the armed forces, have carried out politically motivated summary executions whose exact numbers can not be determined but are generally comparable to those for last year.'' Pastor also castigated leftist rebels for kidnappings and assassinations. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who took office June 1, said his rightist government was not involved in the Jesuit slayings, which took place amid the biggest rebel offensive in the 10-year-old war. The killings fit a pattern of rising repression, torture and political violence perpetrated by uniformed soldiers, as documented in Pastor's report. The Roman Catholic church's Archdiocesan Legal Protection office said 50 people were killed through August, and the government's <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said 68 people have been killed However, hundreds of others have been slain by unidentified assassins, or have disappeared. About 250 people were detained for political offenses as of Oct. 14, Pastor said, `` a much higher figure than the previous year.'' Non-governmental organizations that contacted Pastor in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> during his visit Oct. 8-14 `` complained about a marked increase in the torture of political prisoners by their interrogators,'' he said. `` Witnesses belonging to organizations invariably made roughly the same statement: Long periods of interrogation while blindfolded and without being able to sit down or rest, extensive beatings, continuous use of a hood which impedes breathing and causes fainting, electric shocks in water tanks, use of drugs and acids, and on many occasions rape and sexual abuse of both women and men, as well as threat to family members,'' <PERSON> Pastor </PERSON> said. `` Witnesses who did not belong to organizations complained of psychological ill-treatment and sometimes of beatings and death threats to themselves or to members of their families,'' he said. The government told him detainees were blindfolded to prevent them from recognizing their interrogators but denied there was systematic use of torture. Salvadoran authorities said the claims of torture were `` orchestrated'' by the rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. Pastor found that `` thus far in 1989, government action against trade unions and peasant and other organizations has increased. The government claims that some of these organizations answer to <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. `` The organizations concerned deny this, although independent Salvadoran sources have indicated ... that in some cases ... the activities of some organizations are not entirely independent of <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Pastor blamed the rebels for assassinating alleged collaborators with the armed forces, soldiers, officials and ideological opponents. He said individuals have been abducted by the guerrillas, and probably by government-sanctioned death squads, and are still missing. El Salvador only recently emerged from a period of repression during which death squads and rightist elements of the military were accused of killing thousands of people. The Salvadoran right considers church activists and church intellectuals to be subversives.

 Legislation extending the life of the troubled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for almost two years is headed for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk after winning final approval from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're on probation over there for the next 22 months,'' Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., said Friday as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the measure, 389-0 The measure, a compromise reached Thursday night between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, would prevent the commission from going out of business on Nov. 30 when its charter runs out. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had sought to put the panel out of business for one day only _ allowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to dump the members and engage in what Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., called `` a complete housecleaning. The commission then would have been reauthorized for six years. A Democratic version passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday would have kept the commission in business for only six more months, buying time for an overhaul by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> designed to end the panel's infighting and other problems The compromise provides for no housecleaning, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have a chance to appoint two new commissioners, including the chairman, and a staff director by the end of the year. <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> noted, however, that the rest of the panel would remain intact, `` including two commissioners who have been at the center of the personality disputes that have dragged the commission into disrepute.'' He did not specify which commissioners he had in mind, although former Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, still a member of the panel, has been under fire for delivering before a conservative group a speech titled: `` Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a Minority?'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who is black, says that he is the only conservative on the commission and that he does not believe `` in coddling people.'' At a recent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> complained that commission member <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> has been making `` bizarre'' remarks. In the 1960s, the commission was lauded by civil rights forces for its hearings across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, its ringing reports on racial injustice and its bold legislative proposals. Over the last six years, however, that atmosphere on the panel has soured, according to lawmakers of both parties. A report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 found political, financial and other problems on the panel but they `` have never been addressed by the commission,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. A statement issued Friday by the office of Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said the commission had been `` mired in controversy for much of the last nine years, leading many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to question whether it should be kept alive when its charter expires. `` This is a new lease on life for the commission, and I hope it's put to good use,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` It's a long enough lease to give the president the chance he deserves to steer a new course for the commission, and it's a short enough lease to give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a chance to take another look later.''

 The Solar Maximum satellite, with most of its instruments shut down, is expected to fall to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by the end of the month. The satellite, which has been sending back information about the sun for nearly 10 years, was repaired by a visiting space shuttle crew in 1984. But now it has run out of fuel to power the rockets that have kept it out of the grip of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere. `` They are projecting Nov. 29, give or take a few days,'' said <PERSON> Randee </PERSON> <PERSON> Exler </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Goddard Space Flight Center. A few weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said three big chunks of the satellite might survive the fiery trip through the atmosphere and crash to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But Ms. <PERSON> Exler </PERSON> said there are estimates that as many as 11 pieces might survive. `` There will be debris, but we feel confident that most will be small pieces,'' she said. The satellite's path is 70 percent over water. Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON> flies over much of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the southernmost tip of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The only portions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under its track are <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the extreme southern part of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. For weeks, the satellite's altitude has been dropping steadily. On Friday, <PERSON> Solar </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON>'s orbit was 177 miles high, a 25.7 mile drop since Oct. 31. It fell 2.6 miles since Thursday. Engineers turned off fine-pointing instruments and the spacecraft went into a `` safe hold.'' Scientific operations did n't cease completely; three instruments still were taking and sending data Even at the end, the satellite will perform useful service. Engineers will try to blow off its solar panels, an exercise that would be required if such a satellite were to be put into a space shuttle cargo bay for return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Once the panels are gone, all work will cease. Solar Max cost $ 77 million to build and launch in February 1980, at a time of maximum activity in the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle. Its mission was to study solar flares. But after 10 months of service, three fuses blew in the satellite's attitude control box and it was unable to point itself accurately. That, in turn, caused four onboard instruments to fail. In 1984, the shuttle Challenger pulled alongside Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON> and astronaut <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> reached out and grabbed it with the ship's robot arm The next day, two astronauts working in the open cargo bay replaced the control system module and an electronics box. The satellite has been working well since then. For a time there were plans to reboost it to a higher orbit but that would have set back other missions and the idea was abandoned.

 Polish Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> went through a whirlwind series of meetings Friday with union officials, <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> leaders, politicians and businessmen, and paused to praise American generosity. He told a group of state union leaders that as he was listening to speeches that preceded his own, he came to appreciate what he termed `` the greatness of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he said, `` We fight, we risk, but you are in a different situation. You do n't have to fight, you do n't have to share with us, you do n't have to help us. `` But this is not the way you behave. I thought, ` Would I behave as you do? Would I be seeing this as clearly?''' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to authorize $ 657 million in economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> over three years. On Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> went further, approving a three-year package of $ 846.5 million. After a full day of meetings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> late Friday, arriving at <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 11 p.m. CST. A crowd of about 100 people, many of them Polish-Americans who painted signs of welcome, applauded as he stepped of a plane into blowing snow and ice-cold temperatures. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s meeting with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state labor leaders began a day that included other sessions with Jewish leaders, newspaper editors and businessmen. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also met Friday with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who said: `` We hardly know the man. ... But we cheer him for all the wonderful ideas he represents.'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> announced plans by <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row to publish a collection of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s speeches and writings on democracy in Polish and English next year. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he conceived of the `` Lincoln on Democracy Project'' during a meeting in June with teachers from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> who told him books on <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> were not available in their country. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> for the Lincoln project and alluded to the speed of political change throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: `` I do n't know if you can keep pace with translations for other languages because the line is already forming.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met with about 75 Jewish leaders, several of them survivors of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> campaign to exterminate Polish Jews. One, <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruenbaum </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> of life at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, where he was an inmate and where his parents and grandparents were killed. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he hoped for resolution of a controversy over the location of a Roman Catholic convent on the site of the death camp. He also promised to protect the vestiges of Jewish life in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Although the nation had a Jewish population of over 3 million in 1939, only a few thousand remain today. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> received numerous gifts, which he accepted with good humor. After he was given a set of knives, he said in mock protest: `` I'm all for nonviolent struggle. I will not use these against anybody.'' Presented with a bust of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, he balanced it on his head for photographers. He expressed regret over his inability to meet more people, especially Polish-Americans. `` I would like to reach every American home, to visit every American home,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` I would like to drink a cup of coffee with every American girl, but time is short.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> did manage to spend a quick 40 minutes among Poles during a meeting with the editorial staff of the Polish Daily News, the largest Polish daily newspaper outside <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He begged for some plain talk, Pole-to-Pole. `` How did you feel in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>?'' a tired-looking <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was asked. `` Oh, my God,'' he said to a chorus of laughs. `` I have a complex, standing next to all those greats.'' `` But you too are great,'' offered <PERSON> Boleslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Wierzbianski </PERSON>, the paper's publisher. In the evening <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> met more than 100 business executives at the <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, repository of publisher <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>' eclectic collection of artifacts, memorabilia and oddities The former shipyard worker seemed most impressed by the blunt letter President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> mailed in 1950 to a critic who had unfavorably reviewed his daughter <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s singing. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> chortled as his translator read him <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s hand-written note. `` Someday I hope to meet you,'' <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> wrote. `` You'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes and perhaps a supporter below!'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> concluded his visit to the gallery with yet another impassioned plea for investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, asking the executives: `` Can we work together in business?'' On Thursday night, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> accepted an award from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a non-sectarian, voluntary agency that assists refugees fleeing political, religious or racial persecution. Past recipients included <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>.

 Democratic senators are threatening to slash <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> unless President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> can end violence in the war-torn Central American nation. As an American-trained team of Salvadoran forensic experts began an investigation of the slayings of six Jesuit priests and two others, leftist protesters disrupted a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> hearing, demanding a halt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s government. During Friday's rancorous hearing, Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> declared: `` The time has come for President <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> to evidence his commitment to controlling those officials within his own government and within his own party who are in very large part responsible for the civil conflict.'' `` President <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is either in control, or he is not ... President <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> either deserves our support, or he does not,'' said <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., chairman of a Foreign Relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere Said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass.: `` In an era of scarce foreign assistance, we need to be asking what we are achieving for the dollars sent.'' In a statement late Friday, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, called for a return to negotiations and for an investigation of the killings `` This outrage must be investigated thoroughly, those responsible apprehended and promptly brought to justice,'' they said. `` Any other result would be unacceptable to the community of nations, and in particular to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s senior official for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy, agreed that without improvements, `` the policy wo n't go on.'' But he blamed the current conflict and human rights abuses that have accompanied it on rebel provocations. `` Implicit in our support is a demand that they make real progress in human rights,'' he said. `` Things have to change in <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fighting <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s government in a bloody civil war for the past decade, has undertaken assassinations designed to lure right-wing death squads `` out of the closet,'' <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> said. `` Their strategy is to polarize'' the country and cripple the new government of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, the rightist president, <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> said. And he said the purpose of the current <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> offensive in the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has been not to strengthen the rebels' negotiating position, as the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> contends, but `` to take total power. `` Had they succeeded ... another ally of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, holding power with Soviet bloc weaponry, would have been firmly entrenched in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> said. He said the murders early Thursday likely were the work of violent right-wing death squads blamed for most of the 70,000 deaths that have occurred during the country's civil war. But <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON> cautioned against leaping to conclusions before the outcome of the U.S.-supported criminal investigation. `` We want this crime investigated fully, swiftly and those responsible punished with the full force of the law,'' he said. `` Promises will not satisfy the high standards that President <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> proclaimed in his inaugural address, they will not satisfy the Salvadoran people and they will not satisfy the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> had assured <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> that even if members of the Salvadoran armed forces were involved, `` they will feel the full weight of the law.'' `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expects him to meet that commitment,'' she said. In another development, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> general who drafted a classified military strategy for <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said the guerrillas can not be defeated on the battlefield, and said the war drags on because of corruption within the U.S.-backed government. Gen. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, who until recently headed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, also said the murder of six Roman Catholic priests most likely was the work of the radical right wing acting without the support or tacit consent of the conservative government.

<HEAD>Recommended Gun-Control Program Hugely Expensive, Sources Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A program of instant background checks for gun-buyers _ intended to prevent sales to convicted felons _ would be so expensive the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is n't expected to recommend immediate implementation, congressional sources say. Such instant background checks could cost up to $ 27 billion to begin, sources said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommendation, due to be released Monday, suggests such a program but does not call for immediate implementation `` because of lack of funds and lack of computerization'' of all the criminal records, one source said. The computerization of complete information, including final dispensation of charges that often are not included in law enforcement computer systems now used, `` will cost tens of millions of dollars and will delay this for several years,'' said that source, who said he was informed of the report by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> declined to comment on the report's contents, saying, `` It's still in the process of being reviewed. Until the review's been completed, there's no final decision.'' The report was required by an Anti-Drug Abuse Act amendment that had been approved as an alternative to another measure that would have required a seven-day waiting period _ while authorities conducted background checks if they wished _ before a person could buy a gun. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was required to provide a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Nov. 18 on its recommendations for preventing sales of guns to felons. Implementation was to begin Dec. 1. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who introduced the waiting-period measure _ dubbed the `` Brady amendment'' in reference to former presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> who was wounded by an assailant trying to shoot then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ said Friday, `` The report is a compelling argument for immediate enactment of the Brady Bill.'' `` The report acknowledges that a point-of-sale check will be enormously expensive and can not be implemented in the relatively near future,'' he said. `` I appreciate the attorney general's effort, but I am bitterly disappointed that we have lost a year's time in saving the lives of Americans Selecting the option of instantaneous checks at the point of sale would be a move toward one of the most expensive undertakings possible at a time when the federal government is strapped for funds, he said. Start-up costs for an immediate, live scan of fingerprints by gun dealers would be $ 9.6 billion to $ 27 billion, according to the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Felon Identification in Firearm Sales published in the Federal Register on Oct. 25. Also being recommended, according to the sources, are point-of-sale telephone checks by gun dealers to authorities with access to computerized information and similar telephone checks to an intermediate computer with the same access to information. Those would have start-up costs of $ 36 million to $ 44 million, according to the task force. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said in June that Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had rejected another option _ the issuance of firearm owner's identification cards following background checks _ that would have had start-up costs of $ 148 million to $ 153 million These costs do not include the original computerization of information, which the task force said will involve `` substantial resources.'' It did not give a precise figure. <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> criticized the recommendations because they call for no immediate action. `` This removes every obstacle for not passing the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> said. `` Last September, during the vote on the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> amendment, and for an entire year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did n't have to deal with this because they had the McCollum Amendment -LRB- the one enacted -RRB- to hide behind. They were waiting for this announcement.'' `` It's now clear that nothing is going to happen anytime soon under this directive, which means that convicted felons are still buying guns over the counter in 28 states,'' she said, adding that the rest of the states have some kind of background check or waiting period before an individual can buy a gun. The McCollum Amendment is named for Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.

 The federal government is calling for a voluntary nationwide recall of L-tryptophan, a dietary supplement linked to a potentially fatal rare blood disorder. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its offices around the country will start contacting manufacturers on Monday and ask them to recall their products. A week ago, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning telling consumers to stop using the supplement. At least 287 potential cases of the rare disorder, eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, have been reported in 37 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. At least one death is believed to have been caused by taking L-tryptophan, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday banned the distribution of L-tryptophan. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeldin </PERSON> said, `` The ban is effective immediately. All of the products should be off the shelves this weekend.'' Two trade associations earlier this week encouraged manufacturers to pull the product off retail shelves. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> statement announcing the recall effort said there is a `` strong, virtually unequivocal link between consumption of L-tryptophan tablets or capsules and the syndrome.'' However, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said scientists investigating L-tryptophan do not know why this is happening. Symptoms of the disorder include an abnormally high number of white blood cells, called eosinophils, along with severe muscle pain. The agency said the condition posed a `` moderate to severe and perhaps life-threatening hazard to certain individuals.'' L-tryptophan is used by some people for insomnia, depression, premenstrual syndrome or appetite control. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said all cases involved people who took tablets, capsules or caplets in which L-tryptophan was the main ingredient. No cases have been reported among people who consumed diet supplements in which it was a minor ingredient. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency decided to take the action because of the `` preponderance of the epidemiological evidence that has been obtained this week.'' <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON> said the recall action is voluntary but the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> believes it has the evidence to obtain a court order if needed to remove the product from the shelves.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday gave final congressional approval to legislation that would create an independent inspector general to monitor the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellingence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, answerable to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well as the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director. The provision was in a compromise bill authorizing the government's intelligence activities for the coming year. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the legislation by voice vote. While President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director, is said to object to establishing a tighter oversight office within the agency, members of the congressional intelligence committees have said they do not believe he will veto the measure because of the new requirement. In addition to setting up a new inspector general, appointed by the president and confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the bill would guarantee the congressional oversight committees access in most cases to the IG's audit and investigation reports. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> has fought the committees over that access in the past, and some Republicans complained that <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> had mishandled the matter. `` <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> recalcitrance was its own undoing,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., during <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor debate on the measure The new oversight provisions grew out of the Iran-Contra scandal, when the nation's intelligence apparatus skirted the law to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and send money to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels despite bans on such activity. But the bill omitted a series of other steps that grew out of the Iran-Contra affair, including codification of requirements that covert operations be brought to the attention of the intelligence committees promptly and in written form, and that any third parties involved be disclosed. Those provisions were dropped because the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee wants to try again next year to negotiate stricter controls with the administration, and to write anything into the law now would pre-empt such discussions, said committee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, D-Calif. The new inspector general position would be like other government agency IGs who conduct audits, review the way programs are run and generally try to ferret out abuses, fraud or waste in federal programs. Congressional investigators who probed the Iran-Contra scandal said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general lacked independence and did n't have `` the manpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncover arms-for-hostages transactions or the diversion of profits to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels. Currently, the inspector general is appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and reports only to him. Opponents of the change, including the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, had argued that it would create an impression that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> would be unable to protect sensitive information, particularly about intelligence sources and methods, and valuable information might dry up. Money to carry out the government's intelligence operations is hidden in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget and is secret, but reports put the overall spending level at upwards of $ 25 billion. Sources said the bill keeps on track a five-year, multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the nation's intelligence collection through so-called `` national technical means,'' or satellites and other electronic spying. Impetus for the buildup began with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear arms control treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which brought new requirements for verification. It has been given additional urgency by developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that enhance the prospects for new strategic and conventional arms control treaties with the Soviets in the coming months.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigation of five senators is gathering steam with the hiring of a prominent lawyer, who will gather evidence to help the panel decide its next move. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was retained Friday to `` assist in obtaining and analyzing additional information'' on the five senators who met with federal regulators on behalf of the failing <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> _ after receiving campaign contributions from the head of the thrift. The committee said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also will work on the case of Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, accused in a complaint by a former election opponent of violating rules in the federal housing scandal and other matters. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> will `` assist the committee in determining whether to proceed to a preliminary inquiry'' in both matters The preliminary proceeding is the first of three stages of a formal committee investigation, and <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said it could take several months to decide whether this stage will be approved. The hiring of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> `` does not suggest in any way that the committee has found any indication of wrongdoing, or that a violation of any rule or law has occurred,'' the two senators said in a statement. All five in the savings and loan case have denied wrongdoing: Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> So has <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>. After the announcement, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said it `` was expected,'' and <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> commented, `` Sure, let them do it. I'm not concerned.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said the outside counsel was `` not necessary'' but pledged his `` utmost cooperation.'' `` I am confident the outside counsel will concur with our view that my conduct was entirely proper,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> added. The five senators who met with regulators did so while banking investigators were examining the collapsing <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, savings institution in 1987. The chairman of the thrift, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, gave $ 1.3 million to the senators' campaigns or their political causes in the mid-1980s. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> also issued fresh declarations of innocence during the day. The five men are among the most powerful in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ with <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> the No. 2 Democrat and <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> holding committee chairmanships. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> told reporters he never discussed any deals for <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> when participating in discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. `` I do not recall that there was any deal whatsoever that was ever made. I was not party to any deal, did not agree to any deal,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said, `` ` I'm prepared and we'll cooperate with the independent counsel. If that's the decision of the committee, it would be very positive to bring out all the facts related to the ... charge. `` I hope the independent counsel will expedite it, or rapidly bring it to conclusion,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, commented, `` I strongly support whatever level of inquiry the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> feels is appropriate.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> late Friday got cold feet and backed away from a congressional pay raise of more than $ 30,000 _ passing instead an increase of only $ 8,900 for itself. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which would still get the bigger pay boost, then shipped the bill approved by voice vote early today to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his expected signature. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved its plan 56-43 only hours after it seemed to be ready to accept the House-passed package. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> left in place the raises of more than 35 percent for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges and top government executives. `` I believe it to be an unwise decision for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, not o adopt the full pay raise and accompanying ban on speech honoraria in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan. When it became apparent he did n't have the votes, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> proposed, as a fallback, that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> take a raise of only 9.9 percent, or about $ 8,900, for itself, billed as a cost-of-living adjustment. Both chambers now make $ 89,500 a year. With the smaller raise, the House bill's key ethics provision _ elimination of speech honoraria in 1991 _ would take place more slowly for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decision would mean different salaries for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> earning more at first and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passing it later. That would be unusual but not unprecedented. From Dec. 21, 1982 to July 1, 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was paid $ 60,662 and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> $ 69,800. The final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action came only short while after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, by a vote of 65-34, had killed a move by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, strip the pay raise provisions from the bill as passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a bill Thursday under which congressional pay should soar from the current $ 89,500 to at least $ 120,800 and probably closer to $ 125,000 by Jan. 1, 1991. An initial cost-of-living raise of only 7.9 percent was in that version. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> argued through the day for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to take the full raise. `` If the voters in our states look at what we do, if we work hard, have a complete disclosure of our assets, our speaking fees, then they can make the final judgment,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` The need for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to come to grips with the ethics issue is evident. Public opinion demands it,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> argued that the bill was being `` rammed through.'' The public wo n't accept the argument that ethics can be reformed only if members get more pay, he said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunchbucket </PERSON> is going to stand there and thumb his nose at any congressman who says that,'' he said. Even as they were announcing their intentions on Friday afternoon to follow the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> example, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders were still drafting their version of the legislation. With President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 252-174 on Thursday to raise its pay and that of other top government officials for the first time since early 1987. Their pay would increase at least 35 percent in less than 14 months. If rank-and-file civil servants receive a cost-of-living adjustment for fiscal 1991, as they usually do, that would be added and the total raise would be more like 40 percent. With the higher pay, lawmakers would be barred, beginning in 1991, from earning extra income by making speeches before interest groups. Other outside earned income generally would be limited to 15 percent of their salaries and public disclosure would be increased. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amended the ethics portion of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan to restrict post-employment lobbying by lawmakers and the president's top aides No lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch would be allowed for one year. Cabinet-level officials at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would also face a similar ban on lobbying in their branch of government, according to the provisions drafted by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, R-N.H. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the `` revolving door'' provision was especially important, and that senators should accept the plan even though the ban on speech fees would for many make a cut in their income Senators are now allowed to add to their earnings by 40 percent with speaking fees. `` This is n't really a pay raise. ... It's sort of a transfer,'' he said. `` Instead of coming from the private sector, from honoraria, it's going to be coming from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, a leader of the successful fight against a proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise early this year, said eliminating the `` tawdry'' system of interest-group honoraria won his support for the new plan. In addition to banning honoraria, the legislation would put new restrictions on gifts and free travel lawmakers can accept from people outside of family. The legislation also would end in 1993 the ability of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members elected before 1980 to, upon retirement, transfer for personal use the balance of their campaign treasuries.

 A $ 31,000-plus pay raise for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ but only $ 8,900 for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ is on its way to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk after careening through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in just two days. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 56-43 Friday night to approve the bill, but only after deciding at the last minute that it could n't take the poltical risk of the bigger House-passed pay raise. Instead, senators would keep taking honoraria from interest groups, a much-criticized practice eliminated by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have done exactly the wrong thing tonight. We have failed,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did n't cut back the raise that applies to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges and top government executives, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> early today gave the measure final approval and shipped the package to the president. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gave its approval in a voice vote at nearly 1:30 a.m. with whistling and cheers in the chamber. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would sign the bill, which includes a series of reforms of congressional and government-wide ethics rules. For the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the other top officials, salaries would rise from the current $ 89,500 to $ 96,600 by Jan. 1 and to at least $ 120,800 and probably closer to $ 125,000 a year later, depending on government-wide cost of living adjustments at that time. In 1991, when a 25 percent pay boost making up the bulk of the increase takes effect, the practice of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members accepting speaking fees for appearances before interest groups will end and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' other outside earnings will be limited. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opted for taking a 9.9 percent raise on Jan. 1 to $ 98,400, and gradually reducing the amount of honoraria its members can keep. Currently, they can keep speaking fees up to 40 percent of their salaries. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decision meant different salary scales for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> earning more at first and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passing it later. That would be unusual but not unprecedented. From Dec. 21, 1982, to July 1, 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was paid $ 60,662 and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> $ 69,800. Besides the pay-honoraria issue, the legislation contains a broad range of changes in ethics rules. No lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch would be allowed for one year. Cabinet-level officials at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also would face a similar ban on lobbying in their branch of government. In addition to banning honoraria, the legislation would put new restrictions on gifts and free travel lawmakers and other government officials can accept from people outside their immediate family. The legislation also would end in 1993 the ability of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members elected before 1980 to, upon retirement, transfer the balance of their campaign treasuries for personal use.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday gave final approval to a three-year authorization bill calling for up to $ 938 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Actual aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> still faces hurdles, however. An appropriations measure providing $ 533 million in hard cash for the two East European nations this year is awaiting action on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. But the bill faces a veto threat from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because of unrelated provisions dealing with abortion. The authorization bill, which sets spending ceilings and policy guidelines for the aid program, hit a snag Thursday night when <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators complained that Democratic staff members had removed provisions intended to provide safeguards that the aid program not benefit communist causes and client states. On Friday, a formal conference of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members dealt with the problem, dropping some proposals and accepting or modifying others. The House approved the revised version Friday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the legislation by voice vote early Saturday morning. Quick action on the aid authorization to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> deal with its serious economic problems was urgently requested Wednesday by Solidarity union leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as he addressed a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The assistance includes programs for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with a value of $ 846.5 million. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would receive benefits with a total value of $ 91.5 million. During the conference, negotiators refused to accept an amendment offered by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., extending the efective life of 12 unrelated domestic tax credits, including the low-income housing tax credit The conference also softened the impact of amendments offered by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators, some of which sought the outright termination of the aid program if funds were diverted. It accepted language stating that the program could be ended if the country involved was found to be engaged in international activities `` directly and fundamentally contrary to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security interests.'' But it rejected an attempt to cut off aid if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were found to be providing weapons or military training or other military aid to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Instead, it required the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to report in six months on the extent, if any, of such activities. House Democrats contended that the provision was too extreme, and subject to exploitation by enemies of reform. They said it would require ending all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid if <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> received just one rifle or if just one Nicaraguan policeman were trained. The conference dropped entirely an unrelated amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, dealing with the potential sale of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> missiles to Middle Eastern nations. In its current form, the bill includes a $ 200 million standby trade credit insurance program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> added earlier by the House. The centerpiece of the bill is the authorization of a $ 240 million Free Enterprise Fund to bolster free-market reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and a $ 200 million fund to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> stabilize its inflation-battered economy.

 A national anti-abortion group says it will continue blocking entrances to abortion clinics following the arrests of more than 700 people on charges of violating a city ordinance barring such demonstrations. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> said they would continue protests at abortion clinics in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area throughout the weekend. The group's members demonstrated at four <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> clinics Friday, where they were met by members of various abortion-rights groups. Police said 733 people were arrested. `` Our only objective here today is to save the children that are scheduled to die,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Operation Rescue. `` And right now, the doors are blocked so the women who are scheduled to have their babies killed today ca n't get in. And at every rescue we have there are babies saved.'' More than 1,000 protesters traveled from around the country to oppose the city's new ordinance banning anti-abortion demonstrations within 100 feet of an abortion clinic. Members of Operation Rescue are seeking a temporary restraining order that would allow them to protest. A hearing is scheduled in federal court on Tuesday. Those arrested Friday will face misdemeanor charges of blocking an entrance, with a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and a $ 50 fine, or crossing a police line, which carries a $ 50 fine, police Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said. Spokesmen for three of the targeted clinics said their operations were not disrupted, although some patients did call in to reschedule appointments. `` They did not close us down,'' said <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, administrator of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Surgiclinic. `` We have had patients all day.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed the district's annual spending bill once because it allows the city to use its own tax dollars to pay for Medicaid-funded abortions. A second version of the bill, which also permits the city to use local tax dollars for abortions, was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not yet acted on the legislation.

 An explosion sparked a fire and secondary blasts at a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> refinery Friday night, but there were no immediate reports of injuries and firefighters said the blaze was stable 1 -LCB- hours later. The fire erupted shortly before 8 p.m. as a result of a `` major explosion,'' said <PERSON> Dara </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION> police spokeswoman. Ninety minutes later, fire officials described the blaze as `` static,'' saying that it was n't growing but was n't diminishing either. All of the dozen people working in the section of the plant where the fire broke out were accounted for late Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Spackman </PERSON>. Workers at the plant said flames leaped hundreds of feet into the air when the blaze broke out. The fire poured billows of thick, black smoke into the air. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, a bystander about a block away from the fire, said it did n't appear to be in the area of the refinery towers and `` the flames are relatively small, about five or six feet in the air.'' Firefighters poured streams of water onto the flames that roared within the refinery, located a few miles south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The refinery was also located near the large <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> complex, which did not appear to be threatened. The fire broke out in the refinery's single largest crude oil processing unit, known as a distillation unit, <PERSON> Spackman </PERSON> said. A seal failed on a primary pump feeding the unit, he said. Hot crude oil spilled from the pump onto the concrete pad surrounding the unit and somehow ignited. Oil products in the lines were allowed to burn off. Firefighters from the surrounding <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> communities of <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hermosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION> were called in to battle the blaze, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON>, a Hawthorne fire department spokesman. `` There are some toxic materials, we're told, so it is also a hazardous materials situation,'' <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The director of a new museum hopes to preserve traces of Jewish culture in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, which bloomed in the 19th century but has been slowly diminished by emigration to northern cities and assimilation. Hundreds of thousands of German and other European Jews arrived in the rural South in the mid - to late-19th century, and even after World War II But these small Jewish populations never had the resilience of Northern communities. `` Throughout the development of the South there was definitely a Jewish presence and that Jewish presence faded and settled into the big cities. ... Our story is the same as the rest of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. This is the story of small-town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, director of the Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience. Exact figures are difficult to come by, but in 1987, 28 of the 42 Jewish congregations in four Deep South states had fewer than 100 families, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. Twenty-three had no permanent rabbi; many of them relied on rabbis-in-training sent by Jewish congregations from the North. The museum, dedicated Oct. 15 on the site of a former summer camp about 35 miles southwest of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, will be key in linking 21st century Jews to the first years of their ancestors in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rader </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, the 94-year-old director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, a professor of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said he does n't know of any other museum focusing on the history of Jewish people in a particular region. `` This will encourage Jews to continue their faith. Jews are very much concerned about that because they're assimilating and the culture is disappearing,'' said <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>. Jews were a major presence in the South in the 19th century; many Jews fought in the Confederate army. But they never amounted to more than 1 percent of the population in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and their numbers have shrunk this century, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. When the children of Southern Jews left for jobs in the cities, the older generation became caretakers of priceless religious as well as family keepsakes. As congregations dwindled and synagogues closed, they lacked heirs for the hand-copied Torahs; the delicately carved arks which held the written law; the oil lamps of `` eternal light'' and the history-engraved cornerstones of the synagogues themselves. Many items were discarded, but the devout continued to cling to their heritage _ though the artifacts were often hidden in trunks or boxes, stashed in attics or under beds, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` It's pretty heavy to have a whole culture on your shoulders and you do n't know what to do with it,'' he said. Eventually, the various artifacts were being donated to the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> Camp for Living Judaism, a summer camp near <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, established in 1970 for Jews from <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Camp directors did n't know what to do with the old pieces, and originally thought of them only as a means of furnishing a synagogue at the camp, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. Later, they decided that only a full-fledged museum would be worthy of the artifacts, many pre-dating the Civil War. In 1986 the <ORGANIZATION> Plough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, established by a wealthy <PERSON> Jewish </PERSON> family in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, gave the camp $ 500,000 to build the museum. Along with the religious items, the museum has three historical photographic exhibits, including one that portrays past and present Jewish life in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he is trying to raise $ 5 million within five years to prepare further museum displays and aid Southern Jewish genealogical efforts, restore cemeteries and provide educational programs on Jewish culture. Planning for the museum has spurred a movement nationwide, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations recently formed a committee to look into means of preserving rural Jewish history. `` We're all racing against the clock,'' he said. `` But this will be a model for others.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, aiming to take advantage of developments in the Eastern bloc, says he'll propose cutting defense budgets over the next six years, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reports today <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was quoted as saying the cuts will be `` significant,'' although he did not say how much money would be trimmed. The <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary has previously warned against overreacting to changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its Eastern European allies. But in the Post interview, he said, `` While you need to be concerned about possible reversal of trends in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, there's a real sense that you want to take advantage of these developments.'' Unidentified officials were quoted as saying the reduction for the 1991 fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1 would be about $ 10 billion, close to a cut of 3.5 percent from the $ 286 billion in spending expected in the current fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it believes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is reducing its military expenditures. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions that the Pentagon's comptroller had instructed the armed services to slice $ 180 billion out of their five-year spending plans, the cuts to come from the 1992-1994 fiscal years Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he could not confirm that figure. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he will agree to trimming military expenses to meet requirements for reducing the federal budget deficit and that some Pentagon programs will feel the knife in the years to come. `` There is no way I'm going to do what I have to do without force structure reductions, weapons cancellations, contract terminations and base closings,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, questioned about the reports early today, said he was aware <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s `` order was out'' to the services to find ways to cut back over a five-year period <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he could not confirm the $ 180 billion figure, but noted that in comments he has made recently, zero percent growth would amount to about $ 140 billion.

 A wave of executions of drug dealers and traffickers in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> may be a cover for political killings, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights investigator reported. His report, released Friday, indicates Iranian authorities have not eased the crackdown on dissent or improved the human rights picture since the death in June of supreme leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The report by <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON>, a special representative of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was violating human rights accords in carrying out the executions. `` From various sources, it has been possible to draw up a list of some 1,700 individuals possibly executed, either for ordinary offenses or for political offenses,'' said <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON>, a Salvadoran. `` The Iranian press has reported few political executions so far in 1989. However, many allegations have been received that the large number of executions for drug trafficking masks political executions,'' he wrote. He also cited reports that some political executions have taken place in secret. He said political executions have occurred in recent months, according to his information. `` Ill-treatment and torture, both physical and psychological, were continuing in Iranian prisons,'' he said in the report. `` According to the reports, it would seem that, during the months of the current year, psychological torture has been prevailing over physical torture, with the aim of avoiding visible marks,'' he said. <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> was not allowed into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He based his report on official Iranian statements, news reports, and testimony from refugees and opposition activists. He asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to consider `` suppressing ill treatment and torture, during both investigation and imprisonment.'' According to <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON>, punishments included whipping the soles of the feet with cables or barbed wire, sexual abuse, mock executions, burning with cigarettes or hot metal rods, and confinement en masse in `` small closed rooms with high temperatures and insufficient oxygen. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> contends that claims of executions stem from opposition groups such as the People's <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which it calls a `` terrorist'' organization that assassinates people within <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The People's <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and with an office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has a military operation that attacks the Iranian army. It also admits assassinating Iranian officials. Members of the Bahai faith who testified before <PERSON> Galindo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohl </PERSON> `` described persecution and harassment to themselves and their families, such as denial of jobs and professional education and confiscation of property solely on religious grounds,'' said his report. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s religious leaders contend the Bahai faith, a modern faith originating in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, is a heretic cult.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> signed the nation's toughest abortion controls into law despite warnings from abortion-rights advocates that it could cost him re-election When the bill signed Friday takes effect in 60 days, women in the state will be banned from obtaining abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy in most cases and will have to inform their husbands if they plan an abortion. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is the first state to take advantage of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July that gave states more leeway to make their own abortion laws. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, a Democrat, said he was aware abortion-rights activists would campaign heavily on the issue next year, when he is expected to seek re-election and could face a Republican who supports a woman's right to have an abortion. `` I hope that no one makes it a single-issue campaign. I certainly do n't plan to run a single-issue campaign,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. He said the provisions of the law `` are appropriate and reasonable, given the enormity of the decision any woman faces when she considers having an abortion. The overwhelming votes in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convince me that the vast majority of our people will agree.'' The abortion measure passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 143-58 last month; the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 33-17 on Tuesday. `` It gives a tremendous shot in the arm to the national pro-life movement,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, the Republican who led the anti-abortion fight in the Legislature. <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Daughtry </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> chapter in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, said the bill was `` cruel and demeaning and a direct attack on women's constitutional rights.'' `` Governor <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s signature on this bill is an affront to the health, welfare and interest of all Pennsylvanians. Pennsylvanians will express their outrage over this attack on their rights at the voting booth next November,'' she said. In a statement, Auditor General <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON>, the front-runner for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination, said she would have vetoed the bill. `` I believe that the bill does not reflect the will of the majority of Pennsylvanians or, in fact, of Americans,'' <PERSON> Hafer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetterhoff </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s action `` demonstrated his life-long commitment to what he believes: that innocent human life, and in this case, the unborn ... are worthy of protection.'' The new law also prohibits abortions based on the fetus' sex; regulates the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses and mandates women wait 24 hours to get an abortion. Doctors will have to inform women about the procedure before performing an abortion and explain risks and alternatives. The law also carries stiff penalties for doctors that violate the regulations; a conviction under the sex-selection ban or 24-week provision could result in up to seven years in prison and $ 15,000 in fines.

<UNK>Judge Permits Lawsuit over Insruance Coverage for Abortion</UNK>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge allowed a class-action lawsuit that challenges a state law restricting insurance for abortions. The suit approved Friday by Judge <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> challenges a 1983 statute that forbids insurance policies covering elective abortions except by an optional rider that requires payment of an additional premium. It was filed in July by <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>, a pseudonym to protect the identity of a married 39-year-old <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-area </LOCATION> woman. It names <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Melahan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> attorney general, as defendants. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> was pregnant carrying a fetus with Trisomy 13 syndrome, a condition marked by congenital malformations, including multiple-organ systems and severe mental retardation, according to the complaint. Only 18 percent of such fetuses that survive birth live more than a year, the complaint said. <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> underwent an abortion that resulted in medical fees of $ 1,000, the suit said. Although she was insured under a comprehensive health care policy issued by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION>, coverage for the abortion was denied as a result of the law.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a summary of major provisions in the pay raise and ethics reform legislation approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PAY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, federal judges, and top executive branch officials would get pay increases of at least 35 percent in the next 13 -LCB- months. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would take an immediate 9.7 percent boost. Except for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a 7.9 percent increase would be given by Jan. 1 as a catch-up for two years without a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA. On Jan. 1, 1991, the same officials would receive a 25 percent pay increase, on top of whatever government-wide COLA takes effect at that time. Assuming no COLA in 1991, those salaries would go to $ 120,800. Assuming a COLA of about 3 percent, pay would be about $ 124,400 _ 39 percent above the current $ 89,500. After that, annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would be automatic, based on the government's index of private-sector wages and salaries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 For the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the 9.7 percent increase would be a raise of about $ 8,700.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OUTSIDE INCOME</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 House members, officers and employees, federal judges and government executives would be barred from accepting honoraria, or speaking fees, beginning in 1991. For <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, current rules limit such fees to 30 percent of salary. For senators, it's 40 percent. Once the ban takes effect, lawmakers could still steer speech payments directly to charity, but they could not exceed $ 2,000. Senators would keep on collecting honoraria, but reduce the limit dollar for dollar as their pay rises. Income earned outside of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by lawmakers and top staff would be limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in 1991. They could not receive directors' fees, legal fees or other income for professional services. Book royalties would be exempt, but must be from established publishers and at `` usual and customary'' rates. Both the limit on outside income and the honoraria ban would be lifted if the 1991 pay raise is repealed.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>GIFTS AND TRAVEL</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The two chambers would have new rules, slightly different from each other, on accepting gifts. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, members and staff could not receive gifts from any person, outside of family, totaling more than $ 200 a year beginning Jan. 1. Most meals and gifts under $ 75 would not be counted in the total. Currently, members are barred from receiving more than $ 100 a year in gifts from anyone with a `` direct interest in legislation.'' Privately paid speaking trips would be limited to four days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have a $ 300 gift limit, except for family, and would limit travel to three days domestic and seven for foreign trips.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ETHICS COMMITTEE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel would be expanded from 12 to 14 members and would separate its investigative and trial functions. If a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member is being investigated, the panel would divide into two groups. One would serve in effect as a grand jury and the other as the trial jury.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>EXCESS CAMPAIGN FUNDS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 House members who were in office in 1980 and now are allowed to keep leftover campaign contributions when they retire would see that privilege abolished in 1993.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Both chambers would require more detailed reporting of their assets, liabilities, income, and the gifts and travel they accept. The members who now report their assets and liabilities in general ranges would have to be more specific, especially when they are worth more than $ 250,000.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>REVOLVING DOOR</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version contains an entire section, not in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, on post-employment lobbying by government employees. It would bar members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from lobbying anywhere in the legislative branch for one year after they leave office. Cabinet secretaries and very top <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides could not lobby for a year any other top executive branch official. Federal employees who gain confidential information learned from a trade or treaty negotiation could not turn around and represent private interests on that matter for one year.

 When 5-year-old <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> brought his new wooden popgun to kindergarten for show-and-tell, school officials showed him the door for violating a policy against weapons on campus. `` I think somebody overreacted,'' said <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>'s father, after the boy was suspended for one day from <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eleentary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> `` I think they need to use a little common sense when dealing with a 5-year-old.''

<HEAD>Negotiators Repeal Catastrophic Coverage, Near Deficit-Reduction
Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are calling for repeal of catastrophic health coverage for retirees and nearing agreement on a compromise deficit-reduction package. Final action on those two bills, which could come Sunday, would free <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adjourn for the year. Senior tax-writers in both houses agreed early today to kill the catastrophic program, which was enacted with great fanfare less than 18 months ago in an effort to protect retirees from being bankrupted by costs of a major illness. But two Republican senators who had wanted to scale back the program said they will work to defeat the repeal agreement. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., promised to use every parliamentary tactic available in an effort to prevent repeal, which he said would be an incredible injustice Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> agreed with <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> that repeal should be blocked. That means the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could be facing a filibuster against repeal just as it tries to shut down for the year. Repeal would leave many of the 32 million retirees with no protection against catastrophic bills for hospital stays, skilled nursing care, prescription drugs and doctors' fees. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a compromise deficit-reduction plan worked out on Friday by its chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>. The plan still was subject to final approval by the Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> before being put to a vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. The committees were unable to estimate immediately how much the package would reduce the deficit. The tax committees' portion of the plan includes several minor tax increases and targeted cuts in Medicare reimbursements to doctors and hospitals. The tax increase affecting the greatest number of people would extend permanently the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance telephone service which is due to expire at the end of 1990. Even while <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders were working out a package of deficit cuts, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers pronounced the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> effort inadequate. `` They appear to be short'' of the savings President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is insisting on, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said of the Democratic package. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has threatened to veto any bill that falls short of cutting $ 14 billion from this year's government shortfall. The Democratic leaders were aiming to slice at least $ 12 billion from the federal budget deficit. It seemed all but certain that in addition to the deficit-reduction bill, additional savings would come from allowing the Gramm-Rudman law's constraints on federal spending to remain in effect for at least two months. Because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have been unable to agree to a budget-cutting package, the Gramm-Rudman law since Oct. 1 has trimmed about 5 percent from most domestic programs and about 4 percent from defense spending. Lawmakers are virtually certain to allow the Gramm-Rudman cuts that have already been made to stand, and perhaps to extend them to about Jan. 1. But legislators planned to halt any further reductions under the law. Leaving the cuts in effect saves the government roughly $ 1 billion per month. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill claiming $ 14 billion in savings on Oct. 13, eight days after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved an $ 11 billion version of the measure. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill was loaded with unrelated provisions, such as changes in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A large portion of the negotiations between the two houses have been over how to deal with the extraneous House provisions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has threatened to veto any deficit-cutting bill that relies on phony savings gimmicks, although lawmakers say they believe they can fashion a bill he would sign. Some artifices are expected to remain in the measure anyway, such as a claimed savings of $ 1.7 billion by not counting money lost by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in the government's budget calculations. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says it expects the deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, to reach $ 116 billion. Congressional experts have put the figure closer to $ 141 billion.

 The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, its earthquake - ruptured section repaired and sporting new silver paint, was reopened Friday night in a din of blaring horns and cheers Six <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol cruisers, sirens whining, and 13 private tow trucks, yellow lights flashing, led a parade on a 35 mph, 10-minute trip across the upper deck to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Five <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> vehicles followed the tow trucks across the bridge. Westbound motorists were kept a mile back from the bridge on nearby freeways until after the official opening. It was the first traffic on the span since 7.1-magnitude quake struck <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Oct. 17, killing 66 people, most of them on a freeway that collapsed in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. But the true test for the 8.5-mile <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> _ the longest high-level span in the world _ will come Monday when thousands of commuters are expected to return to the vital artery. The bridge carried more than 260,000 vehicles every weekday before the quake sent a 250-ton piece of the upper deck smashing onto the lower deck, killing one driver. Transportation officials warned that gridlock will result if too many commuters abandon mass transit on Monday because several key approaches to the bridge remain closed on either side of the bay. `` We had a traffic problem here even before the quake,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now people will have to decide if they want to sit in their cars for hours on the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, or do they want to get to work?'' <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> vehicles would lead motorists across at the reopening to restrain any drivers who might be tempted to set a speed record over the empty bridge. The quake forced thousands of commuters to switch to alternative means of transit or take a longer route across the bay by using four other main toll bridges in the area. A fleet of 20 ferry boats was amassed during the crisis, recalling the days when even bigger ferries were common sights on the bay. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Koenig </PERSON>, marketing manager of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, said his company and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gold, the other ferry operator, have been averaging about 15,000 riders a day. The operators have enough money from a $ 2 million emergency grant from the state to maintain increased service through Jan. 15. Ridership also skyrocketed on the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> system, which has a line running under the bay. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> carried 355,131 people, besting the previous record of 352,696 set Nov. 3.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says it may hold up settlement of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War-related humanitarian issues if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> property claims are paid from frozen assets of the fallen <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> government, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are being told. The main humanitarian issues involve efforts to account for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen still missing after the war and emigration permission for tens of thousands of people stranded after the fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> in 1975. They include Vietnamese people who worked for Americans during the war or their close relatives and `` Amerasian'' children fathered by American servicemen. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> authorities `` have given very clear indication that it would impede progress'' on such humanitarian matters if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> settled citizen claims against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> using more than $ 200 million in blocked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accounts of the former <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on Friday. State and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials strongly opposed pending legislation to seize the frozen funds to pay 192 American claimants. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Foreign Claims Settlement Commission ruled in 1986 that they were entitled to eventual reimbursement for $ 99 million worth of property lost during the fall of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> plus 6 percent annual interest. The claims include corporate assets, personal effects and unsold farmland left behind by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees and civilians who heeded superiors' pleas to stay on until it was too late for orderly departure, said the claimants' lawyer, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>. R.R. <PERSON> Newcomb </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> director of foreign assets control, said seizing the blocked assets unilaterally was a drastic step that would undermine the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position that `` foreign property _ whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> property abroad or foreign property in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' can not be taken without compensation. Paying the private claims now could also jeopardize future settlement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government claims against the <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> accounts, he added. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s position is that claims are matters for negotiation, not unilateral decision, <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs subcommittee hearing. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> can not now negotiate, he explained, under its policy of holding up normalization with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> cooperates in a comprehensive solution of the Cambodian question. American interests are strongly involved in the pending humanitarian issues, said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of refugee programs, Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Funseth </PERSON>.

 Two new accidents, including a fire aboard a nuclear-powered submarine, were reported on the last day of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s service-wide safety review that was ordered after a rash of mishaps. The fire aboard the submarine USS Finback broke out in insulation around an engine on the attack submarine, forcing the vessel to cut short sea trials, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonntag </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Submarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The fire _ which broke out Wednesday _ was quickly extinguished without danger of a nuclear accident and without injuries, he said. The Norfolk-based Finback returned to port Thursday to repair the insulation, and the submarine's crew participated in the safety review, Sonntag said. In the second accident, which occurred Friday, mechanical problems forced a TA-4J training jet to ditch in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The two pilots ejected safely. The stand-down halting all normal operations and training was ordered Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, chief of naval operations, after a three-week string of accidents. `` Never in the history of the modern <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, have so many mishaps happened at one time,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top safety officer But <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> said the accidents were n't related. Since Oct. 29, 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 71 injured in accidents ranging from men washed overboard to plane crashes, ship fires and the accidental bombing of a cruiser. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> ordered all <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> units to hold the 48 hours of safety review sometime over a 72-hour period beginning Tuesday; the last reviews concluded Friday. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> ordered commanders to report findings from the safety review to him. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen had no details on what the reports contained. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the stand-down was n't ordered because the service was operating in an unsafe manner, but because <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> wanted to ensure that everything that could be done was being done to protect servicemen. Despite the recent crop of mishaps, 1989 is the service's safest year on record so far, with 69 major accidents reported, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. In 1984, 118 major accidents were reported. Every year since then, the numbers have declined. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> defines a major accident as one that causes a fatality or $ 1 million or more in damage. Where 1989 varies from the previous five years is in fatalities. There have been 102 this year, including the 47 sailors killed in the April 19 gun turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa. In 1984, 64 people died in accidents.

<NOTE>Court Clears Way for Restoration of Cable Blackout Rules</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has cleared the way for restoration of rules designed to prevent cable TV systems from showing syndicated programs that local TV stations also might be showing. The unanimous ruling Friday by a three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> could mean that TV viewers will get fewer chances to view some of their favorite syndicated shows starting Jan. 1. Syndicated shows are those not controlled by a network, but made available by their producers to stations independently. Frequently they are reruns of previous network hits. The court upheld a 1988 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate its so-called syndicated exclusivity rules that the agency had lifted in 1980 to help boost the cable TV industry. The rules allow local over-the-air stations to contract with program suppliers for the exclusive rights in their broadcast areas. Broadcasters claim program duplication reduces their audiences and their advertising revenues while giving broadcasters less incentive to develop syndicated programming. The appeals court denied challenges to the rules from cable companies and industry organizations that claimed they were arbitrary and violated federal law and cable operators' First Amendment rights.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is defending its purchase of 173 custom-made facsimile machines under contracts that amount to $ 73 million, contending they are designed to withstand conditions of battlefield duty. `` This is n't just a normal fax that sits in your office and does its thing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said Friday. `` These are not machines made to sit in a wing commander's office.

The service was inundated with queries about the machines after a published report said they cost $ 421,000 apiece, a figure computed by dividing the $ 73 million cost by 173. <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> disputed the figure, however, saying the service was paying $ 76,000 for each unit. He said the machines were being purchased from <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> under a contract for $ 33 million, and that an additional contract for some $ 40 million covers `` a very extensive list'' of diagnostic equipment, laser assemblies, and other items such as power supplies, training for use of the units, and the paper _ which costs $ 100 a roll.

 Gunmen today massacred a Moslem militiaman and four relatives a day before southern Filipinos vote on a regional autonomy plan offered in response to Moslem demands, police said. Elsewhere on southern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island, two bombs exploded. There were no reports of injury. Voters in 13 southern provinces and nine cities decide Sunday whether to join a regional autonomous government for the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> had made the offer to placate demands for self-rule by an estimated 4 million Moslems. Moslems who have waged a nearly 20-year-old insurgency have rejected the plan as inadequate. Col. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Almadin </PERSON>, police area commander, said the massacre took place shortly after midnight in a village on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION>, a port city about 540 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Almadin </PERSON> said 15 unidentified men sprayed automatic weapon fire and exploded several grenades in the house of a Moslem militiaman, killing him, his wife, two sons and a daughter-in-law. The militiaman's 9-year-old son was critically wounded and two other relatives escaped unhurt, <PERSON> Almadin </PERSON> added. The assailants set the house on fire before escaping, he said. `` I think this -LRB- massacre -RRB- may aggravate the situation,'' <PERSON> Almadin </PERSON> said. `` The Christians could be blamed, and the Moslems could retaliate.'' <PERSON> Ustadz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jali </PERSON>, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said the incident was perpetrated by Christian militiamen who killed the Moslem militiaman because of an `` old family feud.'' `` It seems that they -LRB- the killers -RRB- were taking advantage of the tension in the area,'' <PERSON> Jali </PERSON> said, referring to violent incidents linked to the plebiscite. <PERSON> Almadin </PERSON> also said a small incendiary bomb exploded just outside <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION>'s airport. In <LOCATION> Lanao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province, a bomb exploded in the provincial capitol building in <LOCATION> Marawi </LOCATION> city, destroying election materials. There were no reports of casualties, police said. <LOCATION> Marawi </LOCATION> is about 175 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> and 510 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, the nation's capital. On Friday, 50,000 military and police were placed on full alert in wide areas of <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> because of fear the rebels might escalate attacks as the plebiscite nears. Many Christian voters are expected to reject the autonomy plan, and Moslems form a majority in only five impoverished and geographically separated provinces. Only 28 percent of the 3.9 million registered voters are Moslem, election records show. On Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> urged people to take part in the referendum but did not specifically ask them to endorse her plan. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> forged a cease-fire with the Moslem rebels in 1986. Peace talks collapsed in May 1987, but the cease-fire generally has held. Before the Moslem rebellion peaked in the mid-1970s, an estimated 50,000 people were killed and thousands more fled to the nearby <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Sabah </LOCATION>.

 Hopes for an end to a bitter 14-week-old phone strike were dashed today when <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> broke off negotiations with one of two striking unions, saying the workers had reneged on an earlier agreement. No further talks were scheduled with the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonomo </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION>, which serves 10.5 million customers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> represents 40,000 workers at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telephone </LOCATION>, the subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> that serves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state.

In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, negotiators for <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> said they had reached tentative agreement on local issues just before a midnight deadline Friday night. Officials of both sides said <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> members would vote Sunday on that proposed agreement. It was unclear if the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> could settle independently of each other. <PERSON> Bonomo </PERSON> said one of the stumbling blocks in reaching a settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> was health care for retired workers, an issue <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> said had been resolved in a tentative settlement reached Monday. At that time, the company said it would pay all health benefits if the unions gave up annual lump-sum bonuses and a profit-sharing plan. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Masters </PERSON> said the talks broke down Friday because of the company's insistence that the tentative agreement be signed before other details could be worked out. The unfinished details included company demands for a longer work week at the same pay and an extension of company rights to hire temporary workers, Masters said. `` The company walked away from the table,'' he said. The talks were held at a hotel in <LOCATION> Rye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, a town just north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report Says Ethiopia Providing Israel Naval Facilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> will provide <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with naval facilities in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as part of the deal that led to diplomatic relations between the two nations, a Sudanese government newspaper reported. The newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Engaz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Watani </ORGANIZATION>, also said Friday the deal allows 22,000 Ethiopian Jews to leave for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and pledges <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military experts to help <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist government put down secession movements in the north. However, other reports say there are no more than 18,000 Jews left in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> two weeks ago restored diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after severing them over the 1973 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> daily quoted diplomatic sources for its report but gave no names. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> supports rebels in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and has been on bad terms with the Sudanese government for years. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli government. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> has reported that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military advisers are at an <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> air force base. It said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> turned to the Israelis for help against rebels in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre provinces after its main supplier, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, demanded national reconciliation. <ORGANIZATION> Al-Engaz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Watani </ORGANIZATION> said its diplomatic sources reported that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government gave Ethiopian President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> the go-ahead to resume relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The paper said resumption of relations amounted to an exchange of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military help for the Jews, called Falashas, and naval facilities. But it gave no specifics of military help <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will give under the purported deal. It said the `` military and maritime facilities'' are to be on the islands of <PERSON> Sali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khaja </PERSON> in the Bab al-Mandab, the southern mouth of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The report did not say what sort of facilities would be included or whether they would constitute full-scale bases. In the 1973 war, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> sealed the area to Israeli ships in an attempt to neutralize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s control of the Strait of Tiran at the tip of the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The figure of 22,000 Ethiopian Jews to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> clashes with other estimates of the number left after a controversial U.S.-sponsored airlift spirited out around 8,000 Falashas in November 1984-January 1985. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethiopian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jews </ORGANIZATION> estimates that only 18,000 remain, and the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government sets the figure at 16,000. The mid-1980s operation, which incensed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments who charged that it helped their enemy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, went via airstrips in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. The day after Israeli-Ethiopian ties were restored, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, said the move would `` facilitate the ability to deal directly with the government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to bring out the remainder of Ethiopian Jewry to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A third of this capital's 1 million people were reportedly trapped without food and water after a week of fighting between leftist rebels and government troops. Journalists in the eastern provincial capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> reported heavy fighting in that city and on a nearby bridge Friday night. They had no estimates of deaths or injuries in the city 85 miles east of the capital. Hospital and military sources say more than 800 people have been killed and and 2,000 wounded since the Marxist-led rebels launched the offensive against the rightist government on Nov 11. There was a lull in the fighting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Friday night and early today, with only occasional bursts of gunfire. However, the capital has suffered the worst fighting of the 10-year-old civil war over the past week. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said 300,000 people, nearly a third of the capital's population, have been cut off from food and water and were pinned down in homes or shelters by the fierce fighting. Six Jesuit priests and two others killed along with them at a Roman Catholic university were to be buried today after international forensic experts examine the bodies. University officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms enter the slain priests' residence just before the shooting began Thursday. However, the U.S.-backed right-wing government denounced the killings and said it would investigate. The murders were widely condemned in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and abroad, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador offered protection to witnesses who come forward. Dozens of religious workers, labor activists, academics and political figures went into hiding after the slaughter of the priests and the arrests Thursday of 12 Lutheran missionary workers. The Lutherans, including four Americans, were released unharmed Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said. Union halls and a human rights office were broken into and right-wing graffiti scrawled on the walls Friday, and a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> official said a right-wing supporter with a loudspeaker yelled threats outside the residence of Monsignor <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` We have the justified fear that the assassinations are the beginning of a series of actions against unions, labor groups and politicians,'' said <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, secretary-general of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mena </ORGANIZATION>, whose centrist party governed the nation until its defeat by President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> this year, blamed the ultra-right for the killings. `` Whether they were part of the military or not, we do n't know,'' he said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> said at a Friday news conference that the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebels accepted his call for a cease-fire but that the government has only said it would study the proposal. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said in a television broadcast Friday night that the fighting `` has been totally controlled'' in northern parts of the capital and that `` only a few small centers'' of conflict remained in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s eastern neighborhoods. The northern <LOCATION> Meijicanos </LOCATION> neighborhood was the scene of the only heavy fighting in the capital area Friday. During that battle, a British journalist, 44-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blundy </PERSON>, of the newspaper the Sunday Correspondent, was fatally shot by a sniper. The shootings Thursday of <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellacuria </PERSON>, rector of <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Canas </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> near the capital, vice-rector <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Baro </PERSON>, four other Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter drew international condemnation. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> on Friday pressured the Salvadoran government to quickly conduct an investigation and launched an inquiry of his own, promising protection to witnesses. He said the killings were a `` blot on the image'' of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s government that could only be erased by a full investigation and punishment of the guilty. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> religious leaders blamed the slayings on right-wing forces and called for a cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> government. Democratic senators threatened to slash the aid unless <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> ends the violence. The government has received $ 3.5 billion in aid this decade. `` In an era of scarce foreign assistance, we need to be asking what we are achieving for the dollars sent,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mass </LOCATION>, told a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> hearing Friday. Also Friday, Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said Salvadoran national guardsmen had detained a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> teacher and peace activist in a church along with other church workers since Thursday night. In his statement, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said 53-year-old <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgibbon </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, is part of a <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> group providing medical care to refugees from the fighting. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojeira </PERSON>, the head of the Jesuit order for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, on Friday held a memorial Mass for the slain priests. `` History repeats itself. They have not died, they are alive among the Salvadoran people,'' he said. After the killings, most of the faculty at the University of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, heavily dominated by leftists, had `` withdrawn,'' said vice-rector <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barillas </PERSON> without elaboration. An annual report presented Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s government of presiding over a `` resurgence of torture'' this year and a crackdown on labor groups. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> took office June 1 as the winning candidate of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> founded by <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who has been linked to death squads blamed for killing tens of thousands in the last decade.

 The vital <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, whose ruptured span symbolized the power of the Oct. 17 earthquake, reopened to traffic exactly one month after the temblor. Six <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol cruisers, sirens whining, and 13 private tow trucks, yellow lights flashing, led a parade on a 35 mph, 10-minute trip across the upper deck to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> just before midnight Friday. Westbound motorists who were kept a mile back from the bridge until after it was officially reopened began driving across the 53-year-old structure for the first time since the 7.1-magnitude quake struck <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The temblor killed 66 people, including one motorist on the bridge, and caused $ 7 billion in damages. It shook loose a 50-foot section of the bridge. The loss of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> disrupted the lives of residents who had to seek alternative routes to work, but transportation officials warned the traffic nightmare would continue Monday because of damaged bridge approaches and other highway damage. Commuters who have been using mass transit, including cross-Bay ferries and the underground Bay Area Rapid Transit system, were urged to continue to do so. `` We had a traffic problem here even before the quake,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. ` Now people will have to decide if they want to sit in their cars for hours on the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, or do they want to get to work?'' <ORGANIZATION> CHP </ORGANIZATION> officers led the way during the bridge opening to discourage motorists from trying to set speed records on the empty span, said <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON>. Drivers from two <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> towing companies were invited to cross behind the highway patrol as thanks for having towed for free dozens of cars that were abandoned on the bridge on the evening of the quake.

 Bombs exploded at a Mormon temple and a community hall, officials said, in attacks blamed on drug traffickers. The bombings Friday night caused minor damage and no injuries were reported. It was the second attack against the Mormon temple located in the southern sector of the capital, in the district known as <ORGANIZATION> Ciudad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jardin </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Garden City -RRB-. Last week a powerful bomb damaged it extensively but no one was injured was injured in that blast.

 In a bid to ease conflict among Presbyterians on one of the country's most divisive issues, advocates for and against legalized abortion vented their views at a national conference. `` Church members must learn to listen to all perspectives, or we're poorer as a community,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Batzel </PERSON>, a pastor from <LOCATION> Susquehanna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` In our denomination, there are too many times we associate with only those of a like mind.'' About 225 representatives from the <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB- gathered Friday for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dialogue </ORGANIZATION> on Abortion Perspectives. The church officially adopted a stand approving legalized abortion in 1983, but each year since then its governing body has been asked to reverse the policy. The church began setting up the conferences in 1987. During the opening session, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, associate pastor of a Presbyterian church in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said while she supports a woman's right to an abortion, it should be used as `` a last resort.'' `` Anti-abortion advocates say pregnancy and childbearing always represent God's will,'' but such a viewpoint does not consider the free will of humans, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who is active in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said no issue since slavery has divided the nation like abortion. `` I'm a feminist, but abortion involves the death of a developing human,'' she said. `` Abortion is the death of a person. ... And that's not a matter of personal morality, but of public morality.'' The conference participants were chosen from regional governing bodies of the church, called synods, from across the country. The synods were asked to choose a delegation with a diversity of ideas about abortion. The 3 million-member denomination created a task force on problem pregnancies and abortion in 1988 and is working on a policy statement on abortion.

<HEAD>Air Force Proposes Three-Year Ban of Boeing Office</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Contract talks begin at 4:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s government liaison office outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, has been suspended from signing new contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> because employees there obtained secret military documents, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said. The temporary suspension will last until authorities decide on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> recommendation to ban the office from doing business with the military for up to three years, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Also Friday, a federal mediator scheduled negotiations in a 46-day strike by 57,000 Machinists that has virtually shut down production lines at the aerospace giant. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> suspension follows <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s guilty plea Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to two felony charges of obtaining classified military budget documents. The company agreed to pay $ 5.2 million in fines and restitution. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> will argue against the proposed three-year suspension of its 100-person office in <LOCATION> Rosslyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, saying it strengthened internal controls after a federal investigation in 1986, according to spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. The case against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> involved classified documents obtained between 1979 and 1985 by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, a senior marketing analyst who was fired in 1986. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> is awaiting trial next month on 39 counts of conspiracy and unauthorized conveyance. Some of the documents involved studies of the Strategic Defense Initiative, the proposed missile defense system known popularly as Star Wars. The suspension of just one <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> office may mean the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> does n't want to seriously impair <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s military business, said retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, a military watchdog group. `` I've never heard of debarring just one office,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` They've found a way to sound as if they're taking serious action, knowing there will be ways around the barrier.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> did $ 4.2 billion of business with the government during the first nine months of 1989, but reported it is losing money on its defense-related contracts.

 Hot crude oil leaking from a pump caught fire at the <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> refinery here, sending a ball of flame 70 feet into the air, officials said. No injuries or deaths were reported in the blaze that began Friday night and no refinery workers were missing, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Spackman </PERSON> said today. `` I would n't call it an explosion _ but it was a large pop that kind of scared us,'' said <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Segundo </PERSON> Fire Capt. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, one of the first firefighters to arrive after the 7:50 p.m. alarm. A petroleum distillation unit was damaged, but no damage figures were immediately available, <PERSON> Spackman </PERSON> said. Firefighters poured streams of water onto the flames within the plant, a few miles south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The fire erupted in the distillation unit of the refinery's single largest crude oil processing plant, officials said A seal failed on a primary pump feeding crude oil into the unit, <PERSON> Spackman </PERSON> said. Oil spilled from the pump onto the concrete pad surrounding the unit and somehow ignited. Police closed a heavily used boulevard to traffic for several hours until refinery and fire officials determined that the area was safe, although thick clouds of smoke continued to billow into the night. The smoke was not toxic or hazardous, <PERSON> Spackman </PERSON> said. The refinery processes about 250,000 barrels a day of crude oil, producing gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.

 An 83-year-old man sued a hospital for saving his life, saying its refusal to let him die led to a crippling stroke and paralysis. Before <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON> entered the St. Francis-St. <PERSON> George </PERSON> hospital with chest pains in May 1988, he and his family decided they did n't want extraordinary measures taken to preserve his life To comply with those wishes, his doctor signed a `` no-code'' order telling hospital personnel not to perform any life-saving methods. But when Winter suffered an attack, hospital workers ignored the order and used electric shock to restart his heart, Winter's attorney says That effort was successful, but two days later Winter had a severe stroke, leaving him paralyzed on the right side of his body and dependent on others. In a lawsuit Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pleas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, Winter's attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, asked that the hospital compensate Winter for damages and pay for his care at a nursing home. `` Everyone had decided that if this was his time, this was his time,'' said <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>. `` They did n't let him die when they should have.'' The lawsuit charges hospital personnel with negligence for ignoring the doctor's orders, and battery for using the efforts they did to revive him. <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>'s wife died about 10 months before he entered the hospital.

 Troops have been told to shoot to kill members of a new Tamil militia after it attacked four eastern police stations in battles that reportedly left 43 people dead, the government said today. Eighteen guards were killed in the simultaneous attacks early Friday in <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> district, about 125 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lankapuvath </ORGANIZATION> reported. Twenty-five members of the militia were also reported killed. A government statement said the militia, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, has been declared an `` enemy of the country'' and shoot-at-sight orders have been issued against its members. The militia is believed to have been set up by three former rebel groups that now control the <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Provincial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the local government in the district. Although the militia was declared illegal, the government had tolerated it. It was apparently set up to defend the provincial council from attacks by rival Tamil groups, mainly the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>. Fears of internecine fighting have been increasing with the departure of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping troops, who are to complete their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> by Dec. 31. Indian troops pulled out of <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> last month. In the first direct denouncement of the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and its creators, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> on Friday accused the provincial council's chief minister <PERSON> Vartharaja </PERSON> <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> of creating the `` present situation.'' `` We have information 13 unauthorized -LRB- militia -RRB- camps have been set up in <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION>, trained by the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping force and armed by the chief minister,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON> `` has either gone mad or is being motivated to do this,'' the minister said. `` If he can not enforce law and order in the north and east, we have people who can do this job,'' <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said. Indian officials in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> denied Indian troops had helped set up the camps. <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON>, who heads the pro-Indian <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, opposes withdrawal of Indian troops deployed in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since July 30, 1987. The troops were dispatched under an Indian-Sri Lanka accord to end a Tamil insurgency for a separate homeland. The agreement provided limited autonomy to the Tamil minority. The provincial council also was set up under the accord, and <PERSON> Perumal </PERSON>'s group renounced separatism and joined mainstream politics. The <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, however, reneged on the accord and began attacking Indian soldiers. Days after the Indian troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> attacked two <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> camps. At least 33 people were killed. At least 10,000 Sri Lankans have been killed in the six-year-old Tamil insurgency that stemmed from complaints of discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese majority. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Sinhalese comprise 75 percent and control the government and the military.

 Club-swinging riot police crushed the largest anti-government rally in 20 years, injuring dozens of people and arresting at least 100. A dissident called the pro-democracy movement `` unstoppable.'' The rally Friday began as a memorial service at the city's Vysehrad Cathedral for a student killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> 50 years ago Reporters said tens of thousands of people were at the rally. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> estimated the crowd at 15,000. Five hours later, riot police attacked the demonstrators as they tried to march from the memorial service to downtown Wenceslas Square. Witnesses said police used tear gas and filled more than three buses with those arrested. At least 13 people were reported admitted to one <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> hospital with concussions, and others were brought to at least two other hospitals, where officials were ordered to withhold further details. As the demonstrators marched, they chanted slogans criticizing hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>. `` Dinosaurs, resign!'' they shouted. `` We want freedom and free elections! Communists get out! End to one-party rule!'' It was the largest public protest since August 1969, when crowds gathered in downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> a year after a Soviet-led invasion smashed the reformist `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> spring'' led by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Srp </PERSON>, leader of the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION>, called the rally the `` biggest and best demonstration I have ever seen, better than in 1969 because the atmosphere is much better. We know that we can win. This is unstoppable.'' The memorial was organized by the official students' organization in honor of Czech student <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Opletal </PERSON>, killed during an uprising 50 years ago against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> occupation <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, a staff photographer of The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, said he went with the crowd trying to march to downtown Wenceslas Square but was beaten on the head by police and chased away. `` Many people were bleeding,'' said <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, who saw about 12 ambulances taking people to hospitals. He also said he saw at least three busloads of people being taken away by police. Rude Pravo, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said about 100 people were taken to police stations. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said police seized his camera and chased him away. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Butturini </PERSON>, a Warsaw-based correspondent of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, required 15 stitches on her head, the paper said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. She was treated at <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s Na Frantisku hospital and then released. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klima </PERSON>, an independent student who addressed the rally, declared: `` Oppression is worse than death! We should not only remember the past with piety, we must care for the present and even more for the future!'' `` We must fight for freedom because you can not live without it,'' <PERSON> Klima </PERSON> said. Speakers representing the official student organizations urged `` constructive cooperation'' and were booed when they said the people should `` rectify past mistakes.'' Almost in unison, the crowd called out the question, `` Who is to blame'' for the mistakes? When the crowd started moving toward the cathedral and its cemetery, where the laying of flowers and candles was scheduled, many students began shouting slogans against <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and others of the aging leadership. `` You have lost already!'' the crowd yelled. State TV said some of the participants `` misused the mass gathering for anti-socialist performances.'' Some students at the rally shouted `` Masaryk!'' for <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrigue </PERSON> <PERSON> Masaryk </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s first president and is credited with founding the country after the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed in World War I. They also chanted the name of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a student who burned himself to death to protest the Soviet-led invasion. On Wednesday, police permitted a demonstration by 1,000 environmentalists in downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> but prevented 300-500 people from marching to government headquarters. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s hard-line leaders, who were installed after the 1968 invasion, have generally resisted the kinds of reforms adopted in neighboring Communist nations. Earlier this week, they announced that travel restrictions would be eased to allow people freer movement to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, the conservative front-runner in the presidential election, looked for allies today to beat back a leftist challenge in a runoff next month. <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, of the center-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconstruction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to have won first place with 26.9 percent of Wednesday's first-round vote, according to partial tallies released today by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Marxist Rep. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Inacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> ran second with 15.9 percent, trailed by leftist populist <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> with 15.6 percent, according to the official count. The tallies were based on 76 percent of the votes cast. The government expected to have a final tally officially counted by Sunday. The top two vote-getters will face each other in a runoff on Dec. 17. The country is holding its first free presidential elections in 29 years. In its own tallies, <ORGANIZATION> Globo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest network, showed <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON> in second, a half million votes ahead of <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>. It said its independent count was based on 80 percent of the vote. Both leftist candidates claimed slim victories, but both also pledged to support the other in a runoff. Collor de Mello reportedly was seeking support on the left to shake his image as the representative of conservatives and the wealthy. The 40-year-old former governor acknowledged making contacts with the top advisers of Sen. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Covas </PERSON>, the candidate of the left-center <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He was running a strong fourth with 12 percent of the vote, according to the official tally. <PERSON> Covas </PERSON> did not dismiss the possibility of a coalition, saying, `` It is not up to me, but for the party to decide.'' But he sounded skeptical. `` Everyone knows the <ORGANIZATION> PSDB </ORGANIZATION> is a center-left party, and that should indicate certain things,'' he said in the radio interview Friday. Also Friday, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Manna </PERSON>, director of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, said in a published interview that businessmen were solidly behind <PERSON> Collor </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>, especially <PERSON> Lula </PERSON>, would be a step backward from modernization,'' Federation spokesman <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Granadero </PERSON> said. Ex-labor leader <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, of the radical-left Workers' Party, appeared relaxed Friday in television interviews at his home in <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardo </LOCATION> do <PERSON> Campo </PERSON>, an industrial suburb of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. `` Our projections show us winning by 1 to 1.5 million votes,'' he said. `` We are now looking ahead to our strategy in the second round.''

 A fire raged out of control today in a coal mine one day after a gas explosion and fire killed 92 miners. Authorities arrested four workers who may have sparked the blast. Experts had recommended closing the mine five years ago because of a series of fatal accidents. The republic declared three days of mourning. The fire in a shaft deep underground will have to be extinguished before rescue teams can begin recovering the bodies, said a rescue coordinator. The latest casualty figure was announced to reporters by <PERSON> Radmilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanovic </PERSON>, minister of interior of the Yugoslav republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, in which the mine is located. Most were believed to have died from poisonous fumes. Seventy-three workers in other parts of the mine escaped without injury, mine director <PERSON> Branislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandusic </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bogdanovic </PERSON> also said four people who were working on the mine's conveyor equipment, where the fire started Friday, have been arrested There have been reports that the blaze began after an improper welding job. The fire at the <LOCATION> Aleksinacki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rudnici </LOCATION> brown coal mine, 125 miles south of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, the capital, was the worst mining disaster in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, said the rescue coordinator, an engineer who requested anonymity. The mine is `` the most inflammable in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> due to high concentrations of methane gas,'' he said. He said that five years ago a commission of experts recommended the mine be closed, after a string of fatal accidents that culminated in the death of 38 miners in June 1983. The blaze Friday broke out at noon as coal transport equipment was being welded in a shaft about 2,100 feet deep, <PERSON> Mandusic </PERSON> told the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The blaze cut off the main access shaft of the mine. The government of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> met today to set up a commission to investigate the cause of the disaster. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio indicated an initial finding suggests that safety regulations were violated during the welding operations. On Friday, white smoke rising from the mine was visible from at least 1 mile away. Only authorized personnel were allowed to approach the mine while police kept relatives, newsmen and photographers well away from the pit. Relatives, some sobbing softly, huddled nearby in the sub-zero temperatures. Rescuers told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> during the night that with the fire still burning, temperatures were too high for them to get all the way through to the trapped men. `` Coal dust and methane gas are still burning fiercely, and it could take a long time to put it out,'' said <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stefanovic </PERSON>. He was carrying breathing equipment. The radio broadcast said all but 20 of the victims had families and that the government will provide $ 333 in financial assitance to each family. The radio gave the number of a bank account for voluntary contributions to the families of the dead miners. The worst mining accidents in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> were both at the <LOCATION> Bosnian </LOCATION> coal mine at <LOCATION> Kakanj </LOCATION> and both involved methane gas explosions. In 1934, a total of 127 people were killed, and 128 miners died there in 1965.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> today presented his credentials to an aide to President <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>, underscoring <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s backing for the new head of state. Also today, a small bomb exploded outside the home of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Khatchig </PERSON> <PERSON> Babikian </PERSON>, causing damage but no casualties, police said. It was the seventh attack on the property of a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> parliamentarian since the legislators defied <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and elected <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> this month as part of an Arab League-sponsored peace plan for the civil war. None of the previous blasts caused casualties. Sources close to <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> reported earlier today that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> drove to Syrian-policed north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and presented his credentials to the new leader at his home in <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION>, a mountain resort in the <LOCATION> Cedars </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. However, it was later learned that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> gave his credentials to a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Staitiyeh </PERSON>, at <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>'s home. Protocol dictates that the ministry receive ambassadors' credentials first Officials said that on Sunday morning <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> will present his credentials to <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> in a formal ceremony. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was elected Nov. 5. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed that <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> had presented his credentials in <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION> but gave no further details. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, whose embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> closed last month after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> supporters surrounded it, drove in a five-car convoy to <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> capital, according to <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity. One source said Prime Minister-designate <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, will attend the ceremony Sunday, highlighting the three top leaders' effort to work together. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supported Mouawad's election on Nov. 5 in a special Parliament session held in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s threats to shell the chamber in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> It also has welcomed <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s approval of an Arab League-brokered plan for Christian-Moslem coexistence after 14 years of civil war. The accord shifts political power to the Moslem majority. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has rejected <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election and the peace plan, mainly because it did not include a fixed timetable for the evacuation of 40,000 Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> fought the Syrians, the Moslems' main backers, for six months this year in battles that killed thousands of people. He says the Syrians, who entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate, are an occupying force. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a traditional backer of the Christians, has accused <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, of complicating the peace march, and urged him to recognize <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s election ended a political vacuum that prevailed after President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired Sept. 22, 1988, with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unable to elect a successor. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> emerged as head of a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who served under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, led a Moslem government during that period. <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> this week to form a government of national reconciliation. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> was assigned to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term ended. He refused to present his credentials to either Cabinet to avoid consolidating the partition. At least five other ambassadors accredited to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after September 1988 have not yet presented their credentials. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> withdrew <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and all American personnel from the embassy in <LOCATION> Aukar </LOCATION>, a Christian suburb, on Sept. 6 after supporters of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> demonstrated at the compound to protest against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy.

 More than 50,000 people chanting `` We want democracy!'' today staged the largest protest rally in the history of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulgaria </ORGANIZATION>, one day after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> scrapped a law forbidding dissent. The crowd carried hundreds of banners and sketches, some showing longtime Communist leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> behind bars and with an <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> mustache painted over his face. The hard-line <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was forced out last week. At the end of the three-hour demonstration, the crowd adopted with a show of hands a declaration calling for an end to corruption and police repression, the abandoning of censorship, the release of political prisoners and guarantees for freedom of religion. The emotional gathering, organized by unofficial human rights and ecological groups, was held on a vast downtown square in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Aleksander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in cold but sunny weather. `` This is the return of democracy in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, and a miracle we have not seen for 45 years,'' <PERSON> Hristofor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebec </PERSON>, a priest and a member of the independent ecological group Ecoglasnost, said in an interview. `` <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> is going toward democracy, maybe even a multiparty system. It will not be easy to reach that goal, but we will manage,'' <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Beron </PERSON>, a senior leader of Ecoglasnost, said in an interview. Hundreds of uniformed policemen, some sitting in buses at a distance, watched the crowd and listened to the fiery speeches without intervening. The 78-year-old <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, who resigned Nov. 10 as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, was replaced by former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>. The 400-member Parliament on Friday voted unanimously by a show of hands for <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, 53, to replace <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> as head of state also. The election and the pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> indicate the hard-line Communist state may be ready to embrace the reform movement that has led to dramatic changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> said in a French television interview broadcast Friday that he supports holding free elections. Government approval of today's rally was a gesture by the <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> government to show his leadership is committed to some change. Under <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s rule, only official rallies were allowed. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> eliminated a paragraph, Article 273, from the penal code that had been used to suppress dissent. That article provided punishment for anyone deemed to have slandered the government or party. During Parliament's session Friday, the first-ever broadcast live in postwar <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, deputies leveled harsh criticism at <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. One legislator, <PERSON> Slavcho </PERSON> <PERSON> Trnski </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> led a `` flamboyant lifestyle,'' owning more than 30 residences. An officially organized rally Friday in support of <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> drew 10,000 people, after which about 500 people demonstrated independently with many chanting for democracy and shouting `` Down with the murderers!'' In today's demonstration, independent and police estimates put the crowd at more than 50,000. Some of the banners read, `` We are the victims of repression,'' `` Christ is Our Savior,'' `` My family has nothing to eat'' and `` Freedom and Democracy Now.'' The crowd shouted, `` We want free elections!,'' `` We want a new constitution!'' and `` Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!'' It called out the name of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, popular in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> for his economic and political reform program. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>'s name was also occasionally heard. `` The single-party system is the symbol of totalitarian rule,'' said <PERSON> Radoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s best known writer of satire and other prose and one of 15 speakers, who addressed the crowd from the church's steps. For such public comments Bulgarians would almost certainly have ended up in jail only a few weeks ago, said one of the activists. `` <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> has left us with empty shops, corruption, bureaucracy and despair,'' said <PERSON> Petko </PERSON> <PERSON> Simeonov </PERSON>, a prominent sociologist and a leading member of Ecoglasnost. He demanded criminal investigation and court action against <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, echoing demands already heard during Friday's official rally in downtown <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>. The crowd responded by shouting `` <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> to court!'' and `` Down with <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and his aides!'' <PERSON> Simeonov </PERSON> also called for `` immediate free election and freedom of speech'' to the cheers of the crowd, who chanted `` Izbori, izbori!'' -LRB- elections, elections -RRB-. On Friday, <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> vowed to implement reforms. He told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that the command and bureaucratic system are beginning to shake'' and fresh air of changes has entered the political atmosphere.'' The National Assembly adopted several government changes that cleared out some hard-line <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> supporters and restructured some ministries to focus greater attention on the flagging economy and the environment _ an issue of considerable popular concern.

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Parliament today approved a reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, launched an inquiry into official corruption, and named a panel to study constitutional changes that could end the Communist monopoly on power. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, thousands of activists held a peaceful rally demanding free elections now that would give voters a chance to remove the Communists from power. East German state-run television said up to 50,000 people attended, but an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter on the scene estimated the crowd at 10,000. The turnout was lower than expected in the southern industrial city where crowds of 300,000 and more have been protesting for weeks. Many residents apparently decided they would rather shop or sightsee in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> than attend today's rally, organized by the New Forum opposition group. Elsewhere, more than a million East Germans poured into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, window-shopping or snacking on bratwurst to celebrate the second weekend of their new-found freedom to travel. The endorsement of the 28-member Cabinet gave new Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> the go-ahead to embark on a reform course that embraces many principles of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika reform program. The Cabinet gives 11 seats to non-Communist allies but retains the key posts in foreign affairs, defense and economic matters for the Communists. There were five `` no'' votes and six abstentions in the 500-member People's Chamber in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vote broadcast live on television. The committee set up by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will study possible constitutional changes. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has said he will ask for a change that would remove Article 1 that guarantees the Communists' leading role. Another panel was set up to prepare an election law. The Communist leadership has promised free balloting but has not set a date. Parliament also formed a committee to investigate cases of corruption, personal enrichment and abuse of power. The moves were the latest in a series of recent momentous changes that have rewritten the politics of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. They include massive pro-democracy protests, the replacement of hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> with <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s election of the reform-minded <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>. Almost half of the 1.2 million East Germans who came West late Friday were in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, city officials said. Although the city was busier than usual, there was little of the tumultuous street party atmosphere that engulfed the western sector a week ago. `` We'd like to stay all night and make a party,'' said <PERSON> East </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversberg </PERSON>, 18. `` But already we can see a party here costs a lot of money.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported that some trains carrying passengers from East to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> were `` recklessly stormed'' by impatient travelers who filled the cars two or three times over capacity. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the moving trains had to be slowed for safety reasons, and 72 additional trains were put into service to ease the crush. Marked-down merchandise and makeshift stands hawking cheap leather handcrafts cluttered the normally stylish Kurfuerstendamm boulevard today as businesses changed gears to meet demands from visiting East Germans. The city's main shopping boulevard is usually the scene of posh promenades, with decked-out couples poring over designer window displays and walking well-groomed pets. Portable toilets were set out at main intersections for the throngs of shoppers, who combed stores and sidewalk booths for bargains that could pay for at least in part with their $ 55 handouts from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The West German government gives the `` welcome money'' to each East German visitor once a year as a gift that gives them a chance to sample Western wares. Tables and sales bins bearing barettes, pins, bracelets and plastic watches crowded the broad sidewalks that were teeming with shoppers. After <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s abrupt decision on Nov. 9 to let its citizens travel freely, 1.3 million East Germans rushed to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, a city already crowded with 2 million residents. East German officials punched new crossings in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to accommodate the crunch. American troops at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Mariendorf </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> set up a soup kitchen, at the request of the West German authorities, to feed 1,400 East German families who want to stay in the West. Most of the East Germans who visit over the weekend will return home, but government reception centers were prepared for those who will not go back. In his first speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since becoming premier Monday, <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> on Friday outlined a mix of free enterprise and socialist planning to rescue <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from its economic morass. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> called for more formal relations with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has offered aid to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in return for its conversion to a more market-oriented economy. `` We are waiting now for the other side to respond,'' <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> told the legislators in his two-hours speech. West German officials were cautious, saying the proposal for greater cooperation lacked details. In his call for improving relations with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the premier said the two countries could act on security, environmental protection and other matters of common interest. But he drew a long round of applause when he denounced reunification of the two Germanies. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s recovery plan appears to follow the course taken by the Soviets over the past four years, which allows only limited private enterprise. His address was approved unanimously by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>.

 There are plenty of want ads for plumbers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> papers, but being on the maintenance crew at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> is still the best guarantee of the good life for <PERSON> Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Doering </PERSON>. `` When we saw all the beautiful things in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, they were very alluring,'' his girlfriend, <PERSON> Gabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamper </PERSON>, said Thursday. `` But that does n't mean we should leave home.'' The couple and their 13-month-old son, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, were among the 99 percent of East German visitors to the West who have gawked at the West German economic miracle in the past week and then returned home. While the new travel freedom and political reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> dazzle the couple, their priorities are home, family and the security of staying put. For the 26-year-old plumber, who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as an idealistic teen-ager, politics have taken a back seat to economic considerations. Despite the cascade of changes in their country and their visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> one week ago, the big event in their lives is next week's move into a new three-bedroom apartment. For both of them, the new apartment is a symbol of what is right with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ a social system that <PERSON> Doering </PERSON> trusts to take care of him and his family with guaranteed jobs and housing. `` People in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> are jobless, on the dole,'' said <PERSON> Doering </PERSON>, sprawled on a sofa and sipping a beer. `` Even though they get money, I would n't want my family to live in a hotel, or a hole in the wall, if I can have a three-bedroom apartment here and a job.'' The couple spoke through an intepreter to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at their one-bedroom apartment in <LOCATION> Prenzlauerberg </LOCATION>, a working-class section of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doering </PERSON> saved all his pay from three years' army service, which enabled them to buy the television, stereo and the furniture that fills half their 12-by-12 foot living room. `` I could afford the television because I sold my motorcycle,'' <PERSON> Doering </PERSON> joked. `` Three people do n't fit on a motorbike.'' Last year, <PERSON> Doering </PERSON> bought a 1968 East German-made Trabant, which both he and Ms. <PERSON> Lamper </PERSON> drive. Now the house is too small, with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s playpen and toys. The baby sleeps in a crib at the foot of his parents' bed in their cramped 5-by-12 foot bedroom. Other signs of prosperity jammed into their third-floor walk-up apartment include a washing machine, oversized refrigerator, food processer and electric bread slicer. They count themselves lucky that they were able to get a new apartment allocation from the government in just a year. <PERSON> Doering </PERSON> remembers when life was different. `` I came to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in 1970 with my family,'' he said with a grimace. `` At that time, we were four people living in a one-room apartment. It was a terrible time.'' He and Ms. <PERSON> Lamper </PERSON> openly admit to playing along with the Communist system for their benefit. For example, the new apartment might have taken three years to get if <PERSON> Doering </PERSON> had not kept his own one-bedroom apartment when he moved into what was his girlfriend's place three years ago. The combination of two one-person apartments to trade, and their new child to consider, was enough to swing the odds in their favor. Now Ms. <PERSON> Lamper </PERSON> is looking for a day-care center, or a creche, for <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. Until she finds one, `` I get 700 marks -LRB- $ 35 -RRB- a month for doing nothing,'' she said. `` It's easier to get a creche when you're an unmarried mother,'' she said. `` In that way the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> -RRB- is really a socialist state. They take care of unmarried mothers.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lamper </PERSON> banks her money each month, and the family lives on <PERSON> Doering </PERSON>'s pay, which comes to about 1,100 marks a month, worth about $ 60 at the unofficial exchange rate. Their apartment costs 47 marks a month, the equivalent of about $ 2.50, and utilities run 20 marks a month. They spend about 20 marks a day on food and rarely see shortages of meat and vegetables anymore. <PERSON> Doering </PERSON> said he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at 18 out of a sense of duty after being impressed by a rehabilitation plan for criminal offenders in a factory where he worked. `` My mind has changed completely over the past years,'' he said. `` The confidence they have broken has to be rebuilt. The economy has to be right, and it does n't matter under which party.'' Freedom to travel was `` the first step in the right direction,'' <PERSON> Doering </PERSON> said. `` Now, if a few more things change, life could be really fine.''

 As political upheavals in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> continue, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is stepping up calls to preserve its own conservative brand of socialism. Prominent editorials in newspapers have urged the `` perfection'' of socialism by rejecting political pluralism and denouncing the most salient principle of capitalism: private ownership. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has disbanded its <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> have installed new reform-minded leaderships; <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has replaced hard-liners in the Politburo with moderates. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is proving to be doctrinaire, stressing that the conservative socialist path is best. `` Economic reform must on no account take the road of private ownership, and the political reform must on no account take the road leading to a multi-party or diversified political system,'' said the People's Daily, the main publication of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` The ongoing policies of reform and opening further to the outside world must stick to the socialist orientation,'' said the commentary, written by <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuqing </PERSON>, and printed Friday. `` If the reform deviates from the socialist orientation and follows the mode set by foreign hostile forces and those engaged in advocating bourgeois liberalism -LRB- Western ideals -RRB-, ... the socialist cause and the great achievements <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has obtained over the past 40 years will be destroyed in a moment,'' <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> was installed as head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most prestigious university in August, following a pro-democracy movement led by students, many from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s brush with the call for democratic reforms was brutally put down by the Chinese army in June in a crackdown which left hundreds, and possibly thousands, of civilians dead. Since then, the government has intensified its criticism of the West's liberal influences and exhorted Chinese to unite under the party. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s early reforms included reviving the family farm and allowing farmers to sell crops above state quotas for a profit and to sometimes branch into private business. But at a time when democratic and capitalistic principles are gaining the upper hand in traditionally hard-line <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, private ownership has come under fire in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as undermining the socialist state. `` Privatization of state-owned assets under <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s current circumstances will inevitably create bureaucratic capitalism in the country,'' a commentary in the journal <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Instead of saving the country, bureaucratic capitalism can only drive the masses of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people into an abyss of misery,'' said the commentary, reprinted Saturday in the official <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily. `` In all human history, there has been only one case in which a society of public ownership changed into a private one. And that happened when the primitive communist society evolved into a slave society,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> commentary said. `` If the public assets of today's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were privatized in a short period of time, as hoped for by advocates, power could mean greater opportunities for plundering public assets,'' it said. Wu, in his commentary, noted that proponents maintain that private ownership fosters efficiency, while under public ownership few concern themselves with economic development. But, he said, `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and many other countries which have taken the road of public ownership have developed their economies much more quickly than many of the countries which have private ownership systems since the second World War.'' All shortcomings of public ownership system can be rectified through reform, he said.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said today he expected next month's U.S.-Soviet summit to lay the groundwork for greater economic cooperation between the superpowers. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said he believed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would seek `` a more basic, deeper understanding of what is happening in the Soviet economy'' when he meets with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business leaders want to be `` convinced of the stability of Soviet society ... and on the basis of such a conviction, of such a conception, to build large-scale economic cooperation,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. The Dec. 2-3 shipboard summit has no set agenda, and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said no proposed treaties were being prepared for the summit and no signing of agreements was expected. But `` there could definitely be major agreements, I do n't rule that out,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. Along with giving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his views on the Soviet economy, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also wants to discuss some of the shortcomings of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, particularly the question of massive loans it is owed by Third World countries. `` That is question No. 1, I would say, both for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and for the Third World,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` This is one of the questions which demand serious attention.'' Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have ruled out the idea of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> offering aid to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as it has to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European countries to encourage reforms. However, Soviets have complained that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could offer more incentive to its businessmen to invest in the Soviet economy. In an example of the kind of breaks the Soviets are looking for, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said Thursday the expected quick easing of Soviet emigration restrictions will open up the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for most-favored-nation trade status with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the two leaders would also discuss a wide range of issues, including recent changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Clinics: Pa. Abortion Law To Affect Poor, Teen-agers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s new abortion law, the most restrictive in the nation, will most heavily affect poor or otherwise disadvantaged women and those living in rural areas, clinic directors say. `` It will have an intimidating and chilling effect on those women who are most vulnerable. ... It will impact on the least intelligent, the least financially well off and the least stable relationships the most severely,'' said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Stengle </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION> Women's Center. Supporters of the bill signed Friday by Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> counter that discouraging abortion is exactly what they want the bill to do, since in their view it is the taking of human life. Clinic directors predict that teen-agers and poor women, already confused by the abortion controversy and affected by a lack of state funds for abortions, will suffer by being forced to obtain abortions in neighboring states or illegally after the law goes into effect in mid-January. `` We're going to be seeing teen-agers already having trouble finding abortions ... saying goodbye to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, regional director of Planned Parenthood of <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> of Planned Parenthood Southeastern in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> said the law would result in `` fewer people in our clinics and more people would be forced, through the concern for all this, to go to illegal abortion.'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is the first state to enter a gateway opened by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in July when it upheld certain restrictions in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion law, including a ban on the use of public facilities for abortion. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law goes further, and could be subject to more court battles. It requires a woman wait 24 hours and notify her husband before getting an abortion, bans abortions based on a fetus' sex, and bans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except to save the life of the mother or prevent `` substantial and irreversible'' harm. The law also carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate the regulations. A conviction under the sex-selection ban or 24-week provision could result in up to seven years in prison and $ 15,000 in fines. State Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, a Republican who sponsored the law, said, `` If doctors are less prone to kill unborn children, that would be a wonderful offshoot of the bill.'' Freind has said provisions of the law were designed to directly challenge <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that established abortion as a constitutional right in 1973. Among the other provisions, the law requires physicians to discuss risks of abortion and alternatives with women, as well as provide information on the abortion. Directors say such discussions have typically been handled by counselors. `` Doctors are n't trained to do that; they are medical personnel,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrenda-Roberts </PERSON> of Planned Parenthood <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Affiliates. `` It's expensive for us, and a waste for us, to use doctors to do counseling.'' The concerns about rural and poor women involve the 24-hour waiting period. Clinic directors said rural women often must drive 50 miles or more, and the waiting provision will add an extra trip or lodging expenses to the cost of abortions, which run between $ 250 and $ 300. Critics of spousal notification say it is unfair and unenforceable. Clinics are not required to verify a married woman's statement that her husband was informed The 24-week restriction requires a woman to carry a fetus to term unless it endangers her life or could cause `` irreversible'' harm. Those affected, directors said, will be women who discover birth defects or potentially fatal abnormalities in their fetuses late in term. According to the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, there were about 50,000 abortions in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> last year. One abortion was performed after 27 weeks and 127 were performed between 23 and 27 weeks, according to the records. Abortions have gradually declined in the state since the early 1980s, and clinic officials say the new law will further discourage doctors from performing them.

 Three British soldiers were killed in a bomb explosion in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> today, and a British army sergeant and his wife were wounded in a car bombing in eastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, police said. The three soldiers were on patrol in a Land-Rover near <LOCATION> Mayobridge </LOCATION>, a rural area six miles from the border with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, when the bomb exploded, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. Unconfirmed reports said a fourth soldier was seriously injured, but no other details were immediately available. The off-duty sergeant suffered serious leg injuries and his wife received less serious, unspecified injuries when a car bomb exploded at the British army's headquarters in eastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> police said. No group claimed responsibility for either attack. But suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has often targeted the security forces in its campaign to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. Police and Home Office Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddington </PERSON> blamed the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> Colchester </LOCATION> attack. The explosion there came less than 24 hours after <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> visited the Royal Anglian Regiment at the Goojerat Barracks in the town, which is 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. King was <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> secretary until a Cabinet reshuffle in July. The sergeant and his wife were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Colchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking anonymously, said the sergeant suffered very serious leg wounds. An army spokesman, also speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom, said the explosion involved a car in the married quarters at the barracks and touched off a fire. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, son of the manager of the local pub, told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that his mother ran up the road after hearing the explosion and saw the car on fire and two people inside. They were pulled out by others who rushed to the scene. Police and the army sealed off part of the town, the third-largest garrison town in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and with its Roman links, the oldest. Homes near the scene of the blast were evacuated as bomb squad officers conducted an investigation. About 4,500 troops are based at <LOCATION> Colchester </LOCATION>, which is army headquarters for the 11-county eastern district and home of the 19th Infantry Brigade. Many civilians in the town are employed by the military. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> stepped up security at barracks and military establishments across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> following the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing Sept. 22 at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in Deal, which killed 11 men. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> also has claimed responsibility for a spate of bomb and gun attacks on British servicemen and their families stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A soldier's wife was killed this summer and a 6-month-old girl died last month with her father, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> corporal, in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> car bombing.

 An early morning blaze gutted a trailer in a rural area today, killing a mother, her five children and three other children, authorities said. Two adults escaped, one of them the mother of three of the children who had to be restrained from re-entering the blazing trailer, neighbors and officials said. `` She was hollering, ` My babies! My babies!' She wanted to go back in and get them,'' said <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON>, who lives across the road from the trailer. The fire erupted about 4 a.m. on one of the first cold nights of the season and quickly engulfed a single trailer sitting on a wooded lot off a rural dirt road, said <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's dispatcher <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> The cause of the fire was under investigation. <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON> said she heard some sort of explosion and first thought it was a gunshot, but `` when I looked out, all I could see were flames.'' She said a woman and a man ran out of trailer. When the woman tried to return to rescue her children, the man restrained her. Neighbors said the woman was a relative of <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 32, the only victim who was immediately identified. Mrs. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s five children ranged in age from 1 -LCB- to 12 years old, while the visiting youngsters included an infant and a sixth - or seventh-grader, neighbors said Fire officials remained on the scene late this morning, sifting through the cinders of the mobile home.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has begun severely restricting travel in both directions across its border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and has removed its own citizens from trains, a senior official of the Hungarian border guards said today. It was not known whether the Romanian move was linked to a congress of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> starting in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> on Monday. The congress is expected to reconfirm in office hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. `` For some reason, starting Friday afternoon, the Romanian border guards have been turning back at the border people trying to enter <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenyoe </PERSON>. Asked whether those denied entry were given any reasons by the Romanians, <PERSON> Fenyoe </PERSON> said, `` They are being told that the hotels are full.'' `` Those being turned away include not only Hungarians but also Czechoslovaks, Turks, Dutch, West Germans, Poles, you name it,'' <PERSON> Fenyoe </PERSON> said. Between 6 a.m. and noon today, 873 people were planning to enter <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, but only 515 of them were allowed in, he said. More than 200 cars also were involved. At least 70 people were taken off a train leaving <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for the West, and several were subjected to body searches, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not known how many were allowed to proceed. Relations between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, two <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies, have greatly deteriorated this year, chiefly because the Hungarian government has accused <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> of discriminating against the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians who claim that they are denied essential rights as a minority. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who rejects all political and economic reform, also has expressed disdain for the fast-moving changes under way in neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and other East European countries. At the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, a duty officer said the embassy has not been notified about any problems involving border crossings.

<HEAD>Swedish Mix of Capitalism and Socialism Studied by East Europeans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the 1930s, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s mix of capitalism and socialism became a model for reformers seeking to protect the worker in the profit-hungry industrial West. Now, Eastern Europeans breaking free of Marxist economics and stifling central planning are studying the Scandinavian way of doing things. A parade of visitors has marched through <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the Baltic republics and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself, and the questions they ask highlight how difficult their transition will be to economic freedom. `` The Swedish model has interested us for a long time, now more than ever, both on a practical and theoretical level,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in a written reply to questions from a Swedish newspaper last week. <PERSON> Reszo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and architect of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic reforms, said in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> there is `` a lot for us to pay attention to concerning the Swedish model, such as how <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> combines a market economy and the state at the same time takes responsibility for social solutions.'' Bankers, company managers, government leaders and economic planners are among those coming here. Often they seek investment and joint ventures. More often, they just want advice on how to cope and compete in a free market. The Swedish model, or what was called 50 years ago `` the middle way,'' refers to the merging of a vigorous capitalist-based private industry with all-embracing egalitarian welfare programs, financed by taxes designed to reduce the gap between rich and poor. In the drive to strip the Communist party of total power, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc visitors show interest in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s muscular labor unions and its strong municipalities, which take the bulk of tax revenues and handle most public services. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s government-run retraining program is being keenly studied by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which faces a grim prospect of massive unemployment, according to a Swedish government official involved in the contacts. He was interviewed on condition he was not identified. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been warned by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> that economic revitalization could initially mean one of every three Polish workers without a job. `` They know this is not a good way to start on the road to democracy,'' this official said. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> restructured its economy in the 1970s, phasing out unprofitable shipbuilding and other heavy industries while giving top priority to retraining workers and keeping employment levels high. Today, the Swedish inflation rate is higher than in most of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, above 6 percent, but unemployment is an enviable 1.5 percent. Though <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s Social Democrats are credited with creating the model <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, all postwar Scandinavian countries embrace it. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, admired as prosperous and efficient, have the additional appeal of being neutral, while <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> belong to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military alliance. East bloc economic leaders have been traveling elsewhere in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, seeking capitalistic wisdom and an infusion of aid. `` It's not only us,'' said the Swedish official. `` But it's hard for a Pole to turn to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, for political and historical reasons,'' he said. Traffic has been heaviest to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, which has one of the fastest growing economies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this decade. <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> has a friendship treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and a long history of economic links. The Finns also are culturally and linguistically related to Estonians. The other Scandinavian countries have large East European refugee populations. On a visit to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> last month, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> suggested to Finnish industrialists that they set up a management training program for Soviet factory directors. Similar projects are being arranged privately. The <ORGANIZATION> Danish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> has invited 30 company directors from <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> to attend management courses in <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> next spring. `` They are well educated people, as engineers and technicians. But they do n't know anything about consumer or industrial marketing, exhibiting, transportation, appointing agents,'' said <PERSON> Vagn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The Baltic states also want to step up business contacts in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> for hard-cash reasons: under Soviet law, they are allowed to use export income in the currencies of neighboring countries to buy imports. So far, the Scandinavians have been wary of investing in the shaky Eastern economies. Businessmen demand guarantees that their governments have been unwilling to give. But attitudes are changing, says <PERSON> Tor </PERSON> <PERSON> Oestboe </PERSON>, senior vice president of the Export Finance A @ S in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, which is owned by <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s commercial banks. `` We are working on a new finance agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> countries that would be a big step forward. First we are working it out with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the other East Bloc countries will come later,'' he said.

 A low-level mobster suspected of killing a federal drug agent in February was shot to death, probably on orders from mob bosses angry about the scrutiny the agent's murder brought them, authorities said today. <PERSON> Constabile </PERSON> `` Gus'' <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> was shot Friday night as he sat in a car _ the same manner in which he allegedly killed <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, a special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, who was posing as a drug buyer. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s death Feb. 28 sparked a nationwide manhunt that involved up to 100 federal agents working seven days a week, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> was also to be featured Sunday as the country's `` No. 1 fugitive'' on the Fox network television show `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted.'' `` It's reasonable to assume all of that pressure could have resulted in last night's shooting,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. `` A rational and prudent person would obviously believe that this is probably a mob hit,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` The investigation is continuing; I ca n't say that for sure. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 46, was shot to death in February on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> after he went to meet <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> to set up a cocaine deal, police said. He was shot four times in the head and upper body as he sat behind the wheel of his car. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> had been trying to infiltrate a cocaine ring run by the mob, authorities said. On Friday, <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, 29, was sitting in the front passenger seat of a car parked on a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> street when a blue van pulled up alongside him about 11 p.m. Seven to nine shots were fired into the car, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said at a news conference this morning. <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> was found dead slumped in his seat. The driver, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sclafani </PERSON>, who had been hit in the chest, managed to get out of the car and fire a few shots from his .38 - caliber handgun at the fleeing van, he <PERSON> Sclafani </PERSON>, in his 20s, was found a few feet from the car and taken to <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was in critical condition. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> described <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> as a `` young punk'' associated with the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> crime families. `` I think it's reasonable to assume organized crime figures were aware of the intensity of the investigation,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. `` I assume that people higher up -LRB- in the Mafia -RRB- were as interested in finding him as we were.'' `` Mob justice is n't always swift, but it's always deadly, and this may be an example of deadly mob justice,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, said at the news conference. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was a 12-year veteran of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and its first agent killed here since 1972. His death prompted one of the largest manhunts in recent years and rewards totaling $ 270,000 were offered, including $ 250,000 from the federal government. `` I have never been involved with anything as intense or emotional as this,'' <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said today. `` There were times we were within two hours of him and he disappeared.'' <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> was paroled in June 1988 after serving eight years for a kidnap-murder.

 Two bombs exploded in downtown <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> on Saturday, killing at least six people, police said. The explosions, in two shopping centers, injured more than 60 people, said hospital sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. No one claimed responsibility for the blasts, which occurred around 5.30 p.m. in this city in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state. Similar explosions in June 1988 in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> were blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants campaigning for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. Sikhs make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people but are a slight majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where militants have been leading a violent campaign since 1982 for a separate homeland.

 When <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it was <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> who lent his helicopter to her to visit remote Indian reservations in the Southwest. Now this former Olympic swimmer and fighter pilot _ a benefactor of charities and politicians, a battler of pornographers and bureaucrats _ is the lead character in the costliest savings and loan failure in the nation's history and a <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> drama threatening the political lives of five senators. Whether bestowing his largess on church, charities, civic causes, business associates or politicians whose help he might want some day, `` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'' has always done it with a touch of flash. Typifying his desire for the spotlight, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> insisted on being the final witness in the final episode of six weeks of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearings into the growth and collapse of his <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irvine </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He got his wish and is scheduled to testify Tuesday. Originally orchestrated as a forum for building a case to oust <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> as the nation's top thrift regulator, the hearings instead have evolved into a near inquisition for the senators, to whom <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> and his associates gave $ 1.3 million in his highly public war with <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s regulators. Although he was formally subpoenaed by the committee, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s associates say he welcomes an opportunity to tell his side of the <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> story: that it was regulators who created the S & amp; L nightmare, not him But just how forthcoming the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> millionaire will be before congressional inquisitors was unclear as of late last week. The target of a criminal grand jury in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, various racketeering and fraud suits and ongoing investigations by three federal agencies, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> is being advised by some to keep his silence. For <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, that's a tall order. From his initial entry onto the public stage as an anti-smut crusader, he has been anything but silent. When the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> seized <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> last April _ two years after the federal agency's examiners recommended _ <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> bluntly asserted to reporters the purpose of his largesse to elected officeholders. `` One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause,'' he said. `` I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.'' Four of five <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> says he meant to influence _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich.; and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>. _ have told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in formal responses that they did The fifth, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., will submit his response to the formal committee inquiry before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns for Thanksgiving, according to a spokesman But regulators have told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel they never had seen such bold political interference as <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> engineered. `` We've never experienced a guy who had so much juice,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s savings and loan commissioner. Altogether, regulators expect <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s failure will cost taxpayers up to $ 2 billion. They contend in a suit against <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> that the losses stemmed from fraud, insider abuse and racketeering. `` If our recommendations had been followed, the taxpayers would have suffered dramatically smaller losses,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, one of the four <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials summoned to meet with the five senators. Born into a prominent <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> family with strong Republican connections, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, now 65, began a three-decade-long crusade against pornography in the late 1950s. In 1970, he won an appointment from President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Obscenity and Pornography as a self-described `` book burner.'' He promptly sued the commission to block publication of its report until he could write a dissent to its conclusion that pornography posed no threat. A lawyer by training, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> turns to suits frequently in waging his campaigns. He's filed several against the government since buying <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> for $ 51 million in 1984 and converting it from a traditional home mortgage lender into what critics say was the epitome of the kind of highflier thrifts that were at the root of industry problems that required a $ 157 billion taxpayer bailout. Other tactics include hiring away at large salaries the state and federal regulators and private auditors charged with overseeing his empire on behalf of the public. The <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> managing partner of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s auditor, the Big Eight accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, helped set up the meetings between the regulators and the senators with a report affirming <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s soundness. A year later, he joined <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s payroll with an annual salary of $ 950,000. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, who accepted $ 200,000 in campaign donations from <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, recalled feeling `` livid'' when he learned that. `` I could n't believe it,'' he said. `` Absolutely I felt I was led down the primrose path.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said he has no intention of returning the $ 200,000 contribution. Those <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> did n't hire, he retained, such as <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, formerly the president's chief economic adviser and now chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Then working as a private consultant, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> wrote a study in 1986 defending <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s practices. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s business instincts and proclivity to spend whatever is necessary to get what he wants were developed at the knee of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindner </PERSON>, a reclusive <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> billionaire who through takeovers built <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into a banking, insurance, real estate and meatpacking empire. It was as a vice president and director there that <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> had his first run-in with financial regulators. After a three-year investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> accused the two of fraudulently diverting company assets for their personal use. They eventually signed a consent decree in 1979 admitting no wrong but promising never to do it again. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> later said signing the decree was a mistake, claiming it cost him an appointment from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to be <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. About the time the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> was launching its first investigation of <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, he moved to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> to head <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a troubled home-building subsidiary of American Financial. Two years later, in 1978, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> bought out <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION> and changed its name to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and began doling out large contributions to candidates for every office from city council to the presidency. In 1980 he was the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> finance chairman in now-bankrupt former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>'s short-lived campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. There he met <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Henkel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> tax lawyer and former chief counsel at the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> during part of the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, who was carrying out the same task for <PERSON> Connally </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Six years later when <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and his staff began reigning in the way some thrifts were operating, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> helped win <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appointment of <ORGANIZATION> Henkel </ORGANIZATION> to the bank board. <ORGANIZATION> Henkel </ORGANIZATION> resigned from the board four months later after it was disclosed he had loans or shared in partnerships with loans from <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> totaling $ 60 million. But first he proposed changing the board's regulations to exempt much of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s investments from the newly imposed restrictions. The changes were rejected by the board's other members. `` I have taken every action appropriate to rectify the unwarranted bureaucratic assault ... waged against me and my company,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said last April. `` In the contract between the voter and the politician, we have the right to seek their help when needed and demand it when justified. This I have done.''

 <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> came to the nation's biggest Polish-American community to seek financial help for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s struggling economy, but he said today he is not here with his `` hat held out. `` I have come here to prove that our system does not beg ... but appeals to you as teachers, to help us to step onto the right path of development,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said at a morning meeting with officials of the Polish American <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to learn from you how to develop a country, how to move it from a system that failed to one that works.'' The Nobel prize-winning labor leader said he is not seeking direct financial aid from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politicians or businessmen, emphasizing that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wants to concentrate on joint ventures. `` We should n't go around with our hat held out,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, speaking through an interpreter. Although business was on his mind, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first moments in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> after his arrival late Friday were warmed by a welcome in the tradition of his homeland. He was given a loaf of bread, a bag of salt and a bouquet of flowers by about 100 people who greeted him at a neighborhood monument to the Solidarity movement he helped found. `` He is a symbol to us. We call him ` harnash,''' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzierzega </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highlanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` It means leader, and he is our leader, a symbol of freedom.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> arrived at Midway Airport late Friday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on the latest leg of a trip intended to encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s faltering economy. The trip included an emotional meeting with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a speech before an enthusiastic joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in which <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, an electrician, said investment from the West is needed to ensure the success of political reforms in his country. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, with 800,000 residents of <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> descent, is the biggest Polish community outside <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s one-day visit was expected to draw large crowds. The agenda consists largely of meetings with business and labor leaders. At Friday night's ceremony in the city's heavily Polish southwest side, the traditional gifts of welcome were presented by members of the <PERSON> Highlanders </PERSON>, who work to preserve Polish culture in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` He said he was happy to see us here in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dzierzega </PERSON> said. Members of the group, dressed in embroidered folk shirts and blouses and lamb's wool vests, also gave <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> an ax, which they said was a Polish symbol of freedom. Despite wind-whipped snow and sub-freezing temperatures, about 100 people greeted him at the stone memorial to Solidarity, and a score of others were turned away by security guards. `` I am Polish. I was a union member, and what I like about the guy is he had guts,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mrozowski </PERSON> said as the motorcade left. `` He said he was going to organize a union, and that was it.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> departs tonight for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He was scheduled to attend Mass Sunday at a Polish shrine in <LOCATION> Doylestown </LOCATION>, a suburb.

<HEAD>One Year Later Quayle Has Bush Support But Wrestles With His Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For very different reasons, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and comedian <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> want <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on the 1992 Republican ticket. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` an outstanding vice president'' who has his heart in his job, late night television personality <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> quipped, `` Now if he can just get his mind in the job.'' Eleven months after the former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator survived a difficult political campaign and became vice president, he has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for another four-year term. At the same time, though, he remains a popular target for the likes of <PERSON> Leno </PERSON> _ and a worrisome factor for Republicans watching public opinion polls giving <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> consistently low ratings. `` I'm not going to do anything differently no matter what the polls say,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> recently told reporters. `` I'm going to work as I believe a vice president should work, that is, first and foremost with complete loyalty to the president, for the advancement of his agenda, in his interests and that's what I'm doing.'' The most recent surveys, a Wall Street Journal-NBC News sampling taken early this month, reported more than half of the voters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should choose a different running mate in 1992. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could not even claim support from the Republicans polled. By a 40 to 39 percent margin, they said he should be dumped. `` You ca n't argue with those polls. It's unfortunate that people have n't recognized his contributions to the administration and the party,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has accomplished his first-year goals of solidifying his position within the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and of working with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials around the country. `` As people begin to recognize his contributions in those areas, the polls will take care of themselves,'' <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said. The vice president also has emerged as a link with the White House for conservatives, some of whom are distrustful of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is credited with raising $ 5 million in campaign contributions for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates and causes. Expectations were low when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took office, in part because of a presidential campaign in which his selection became an issue. Even now, praise for the vice president from Republicans often begins with a sigh of relief that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has avoided serious gaffes and avoided embarrassing the president. `` He's fulfilling the functions for which he was selected,'' said political analyst <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` He does not challenge, he does not question the president. He does n't make any trouble.'' His standing was n't helped by a new book on the 1988 campaign, `` Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars'' by reporters <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Germond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Witcover </PERSON>. Republican consultants who worked with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the campaign were quoted as offering unflattering descriptions of the vice presidential nominee. `` He was like a kid,'' the book quoted <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON> as saying. `` Ask him to turn off a light and by the time he gets to the switch, he's forgotten what he went for.'' When asked by <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reporters this month whether he would keep <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on the ticket, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seized the chance to say he `` absolutely'' would. That word from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ a vice president himself for eight years _ was widely regarded as a move to head off rumors that were beginning to surface regarding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s future. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knew better than anyone else how frustrating such rumors are and wanted to put them to rest,'' said an administration official who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Given <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for his vice president, Republicans were insistent that they not be linked by name to any critical statements. One party official said <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> stalwarts `` are trying to make the best of what might otherwise be a bad situation.'' In speeches, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> often puts his own stamp on administration policy, careful to follow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead but adding a conservative edge. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a passionate defender of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Initiative _ the space-based missile defense system _ and he takes a consistently skeptical view of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s reform moves. Recently he took a harder line on U.S.-Soviet relations than the more optimistic view articulated just a day earlier in a major speech by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The White House hastened to insist that the two speeches were not inconsistent. Despite private grumbling within the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>, there is no shortage of Republicans willing to praise <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> publicly. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> is personally well liked. He is eager to help everyone on both a partisan and non-partisan level and he has the support of the president,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., a close ally of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> On the fund-raising circuit, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> touts <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as one of its principle assets _ with some $ 5 million to his credit so far. <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been adept at building support among party regulars at the state and local level. New Jersey Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is absolutely convinced that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a good public servant and that he is growing and that he is learning on the job.'' `` He needed that kind of reassurance from the president,'' said <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. Rumors that some factions wanted to dump <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> from the ticket in 1992 were `` very, very destructive,'' when the vice president travels as a representative of the administration, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pay Bill Requires Judges To Work For Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pay raise awaiting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature would stop able-bodied, semiretired federal judges from collecting pay raises while doing no judicial work But an exception would be granted for former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> and any others who, like him, work full-time on a federal or state entity outside the judicial system. The pay package for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, judges and senior executives, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, contains a bipartisan proposal to alter the pay provisions for senior judges _ those who opt for a reduced workload after they reach age 65 with 15 years experience. To get full raises, senior judges would have to do the equivalent of three months of judicial work a year or be disabled. Healthy senior judges who did not work that minimum would continue to receive the full pay they got before they stopped working, plus any subsequent cost-of-living increases. The proposal to restrict pay raises for non-working senior judges was introduced by Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, D-Wis., and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Calif., chairman and ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> courts subcommittee, last April after The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> found that nearly 20 percent of the 277 senior judges did no judicial Since then, drafters added one provision which, <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> conceded, would have the effect of preserving the pay raise for former Chief Justice <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who has not heard a case since stepping down in 1986. Since then, he has been chairman of the bicentennial of the Constitution and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> of Rights. The panel continues through 1991. The provision allows full pay raises for senior judges, like <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who work full-time `` for a federal or state governmental entity.'' One source, who declined to be named, said <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>'s views that senior judges ought to get full pay raises for such work had been made known to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>'s pay, and that of current Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, would rise from $ 115,000 now to $ 124,000 in January and at least $ 155,000 on Jan. 1991. The bill would boost the salaries of federal district judges from $ 89,500 to $ 120,800 in January and at least $ 124,400 in January, 1991. Appeals courts salaries would rise from $ 95,000 to $ 102,500 and then at least to $ 128,100. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices would go from $ 110,000 to $ 118,700 and at least to $ 148,400. The final figures in all four categories are contingent on inflation and are likely to be increased as a result of a cost-of-living increase in January 1991, currently expected to be around 3 percent. <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> said last week that, `` The only judges who will not receive the raise are those who should not receive it: the ones in good health who affirmatively opt not to work.'' Nevertheless, spokesmen for the federal judiciary have bitterly opposed any curtailment in raises for any category of senior judge. As the bill neared passage, sources said, representatives of the judiciary tried without success to find support for an amendment that would exempt all current judges from the restrictions and apply them only to future appointees. Members of <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>'s subcommittee told judicial leaders at a hearing last April that The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> stories about the pay of senior judges had prompted a torrent of constituent complaints and introduction of the legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> reported previously unpublished federal figures from 1987 that showed that 20 percent of the 306 senior judges that year did no judicial work. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of all senior judges in February and March of this year found that 17 percent of 277 senior judges did no judicial work. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey credited judges for dormant cases still on their dockets, which the earlier government data had not. Under the new rules, senior judges could fulfill their work requirement by hearing cases in court or by writing opinions and handling settlements and motions. In either case, the chief judge of their circuit would have to certify that they had done during the year an amount of work equal to that which an active judge would complete in three months. They also could complete the requirement for full raises by working full-time on administrative duties directly related to the operation of the courts, such as at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Senior judges who fail to meet the work requirement as a result of either temporary or permanent disability would continue to receive all raises given full-time judges.

A <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper reported that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is considering reopening its mission in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but moving it out of the region controlled by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The presenting of credentials underscored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> backing for the new head of state, whom <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> opposes, and intensified the general's political isolation Earlier, a small bomb exploded outside the home of Armenian parliamentary deputy <PERSON> Khatchig </PERSON> <PERSON> Babikian </PERSON> in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, causing damage but no casualties, police reported. It was the seventh attack on a Christian parliamentarian since legislators defied <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and elected <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> president on Nov. 5 to oversee implementation of an Arab League-sponsored peace plan to end 14 years of civil war. The accord was reached by the legislators in 23 days of talks in the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif. <PERSON> Mccarthy </PERSON> and his bodyguards arrived in <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION> in a five-car convoy. Security around <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>'s two-story stone mansion was tight. `` I wanted to bring the greetings of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to President <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> told reporters. `` My country was very, very pleased to see the developments that took place in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, to see the election of a new president here, to see that the situation, that had been ambigious in terms of legality, has now totally cleared,'' he added. `` You have a president. That's a wonderful thing.'' In remarks aimed at <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has a long tradition of constitutional democracy. In that tradition, as far as I know, military officers have always followed the civilian authority.'' The envoy said he assumed that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, `` like the good soldier he is ... will very soon fall in line behind civilian authority. I certainly hope so.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` has a good deal of respect for Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'' and agreed with his goals. `` It was really the means he was using that we quarreled with.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who seeks to force the 40,000 Syrian soldiers out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, fought them for six months in fierce artillery battles that killed more than 900 people and wounded nearly 3,000. The fighting ended Sept. 22 with an Arab League-brokered cease-fire. The general opposed the Taif accord because it did not include a guarantee for the withdrawal of the Syrians, who were deployed in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to quell civil war fighting. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said they defied that mandate by siding with the Moslems. <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Staitiyeh </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s political affairs department, said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> presented a copy of his credentials to him at 1:45 p.m. The ambassador will formally present his credentials to <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION> on Sunday, officials reported. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> held a 30-minute meeting with <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON>. Reporters were not allowed in, but photographers were given 10 minutes to take pictures. The two men later drove together in <LOCATION> Mouawad </LOCATION>'s bulletproof Mercedes to the neighboring town of <LOCATION> Zghorta </LOCATION> away for a lunch given by former President <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>. Lebanese soldiers in armored personnel carriers guarded the mountain road between <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zghorta </LOCATION>. Mouawad and <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION> several hours later and talked for 90 minutes. No statement was issued. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> As-Safir </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` seriously considering reopening its embassy in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but outside the Christian enclave'' controlled by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The daily quoted unnamed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sources as saying <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> would discuss with <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> the idea of moving the embassy to the Syrian-policed north. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats evacuated the embassy in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sept. 6 after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> loyalists besieged it. Asked whether the embassy would reopen, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said: `` We'll return as soon as our security can be guaranteed and as soon as we're certain we can have contacts with all the different political leaders in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may have settled a lot of old scores in her memoir, `` My Turn,'' but the critics panned it when they got their turn. With only a few exceptions, the book has been reviewed as shallow and mean. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer's critic, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, suggested the former first lady could have called it `` Take That.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauter </PERSON> called it a `` self-indictment.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrenreich </PERSON> commented on its `` whining'' quality. Said critic <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>: `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has written a book she should n't have. Instead of changing a hoity-toity image she is unhappy with, she has reinforced it. If you thought she cared too much about clothes and furniture and china and decoration and every form of appearance, this book proves you are right.'' `` Smugness infects these memoirs,'' said R.W. Apple Jr. in The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s self-satisfaction and self-righteousness shine out from page afer page.'' On the other hand, some critics found an unexpected side to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ warm humor. In the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collin </PERSON> called the book as much fun as `` a long gossipy lunch'' and predicted, `` History may be pretty kind to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Mercury News critic <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had produced `` a blunt, very funny memoir.'' Whatever the critics' verdict, of course, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, can laugh all the way to the bank. She has produced a hit. Her book leaped to first-place on most best seller compilations. It took the No. 2 spot on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' widely-watched best seller list for Nov. 19 and her agent <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Janklow </PERSON> says it will reign as No. 1 in the list the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> will print Nov. 26. <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher, denies reports that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was paid $ 2 million in advance royalties but wo n't disclose the actual figure. Industry scuttlebutt is that it may have been more. As for the reviews, <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> publicist <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> calls them `` political,'' saying, `` People seem to be reviewing <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rather than the book.'' Agent <PERSON> Janklow </PERSON> says the reviews have been negative because people expect a first lady to write a sweet and-then-I-entertained sort of book, which Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s is n't. `` She unburdens herself of her pent-up anger and I think that's what makes it a wonderful book,'' says <PERSON> Janklow </PERSON> In the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, reviewer <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> wrote that she was struck by how much anger Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> displayed. She said she turned back the corners of pages on which Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mentioned being angry, furious, outraged, irritated or annoyed and counted 42 turned corners in 370 pages. Among the people Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was angry about were Ms. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, author of what she called `` a very negative article about me,'' and Ms. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s husband, <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> executive editor <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradlee </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, who specializes in first ladies, says he suspects Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> comes across as more bitter than she intended. That happens, he says, when people `` write'' their books, like she did, by speaking into a tape recorder, allowing a ghostwriter to polish their words. By not having to put pen to paper, the author does not have to think about what he is saying and the result, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> says, can be `` like a heated letter you read the next morning and throw away. Well, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent out the heated letter.'' Among Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s targets _ people she said have made her angry _ noted Ms. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, were <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sears </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Safire </PERSON>, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Didion </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, doctors who appear on television, the press, her stephicldren <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and especially her daugher <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>. The attack on <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>, she says, `` is so hurtful, so painful, so embarrassing, so pathetic that it takes your breath away.''

<HEAD>BERLIN: assembled anchormen.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 This is the wall everyone watches. `` The German question is open so long as the <ORGANIZATION> Brandenburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> is closed,'' says West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON>. That, too, is painted on the wall. Farther south at <LOCATION> Potsdamer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platz </LOCATION> is the new opening where photographers and gawkers jostle with Berliners exercising their new mobility. A billboard records that this barren ground was, in 1932, jammed with autos and electric trolley cars. On June 16, 1953, three years before the Hungarian uprising, rock-throwing Germans in the Eastern sector took on Soviet tanks. <PERSON> Wallbangers </PERSON> have been most active where the barrier takes a big turn to the east. One hole along the base was large enough for a head to poke through, but most were no more than five inches wide even though several feet long. Bad concrete, it's obvious, was not one of the failures of East German socialism. Two young Americans tried their luck with a piece of angle-iron and waved a little <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag through the opening. `` Get your flag out of here!'' a German woman shouted in English. `` Show your flag in your own country, not here.'' `` But this is the American sector,'' one of the Americans explained. `` American sector!'' the German snorted. `` Do you think this is some kind of colony?'' The wall here is at its rudest. It swallows streets, blocks trolley tracks, crowds front porches along <ORGANIZATION> Niederkirchener </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strasse </ORGANIZATION>. Proximity breeds creativity. One artist glued shards of mirrors on the wall, creating an illusion of transparency. Another covered five concrete panels with a huge blue question mark on an aquamarine background, over a tormented caption: `` Humanity is steering toward a black hole, we're gaining speed, but the narrowest passage is ahead.'' A misshapen cross says `` <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honnecker </PERSON> RIP,'' the misspelling of his last name a final insult to the hardline East German leader who was ousted Oct. 18. Beyond Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> and the Checkpoint Charlie Museum, fresh mums were tangled in the barbed wire entwined on a wooden cross. It tells of the agonizing death of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fechter </PERSON>, who was shot and lay by the wall for 50 minutes in 1962, bleeding and calling for help. West German police could only throw first-aid packs over the wall. Finally, East German guards carried <PERSON> Fechter </PERSON> away. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> changes from park to slum to suburb to woodland to lakeshore, but the Wall hardly changes for miles. There are places of rustling leaves and birdsong, and little desolation rows where the sidewalk is squeezed between the Wall and the various high walls and barbed wire of private property. In the run-down <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> area, <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s ultra-left `` autonomen'' have parked their wooden caravans and shacks in the shelter of the wall. A couple of goats were tethered across the street, and small signs warned, `` No photographs.'' `` No reunification. No Fourth Reich,'' said a banner hanging from a ramshackle tower. `` The freedom that they mean is for the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>,'' said another banner, referring to the country's biggest bank. Way out in <LOCATION> suburbia </LOCATION>, one of the newest crossings is a bridge leading into <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>. The East Germans have long called it the Unity Bridge. Such communist irony inspired some professionally painted official graffiti on the Western shore: `` Those who gave it the name of the Bridge of Unity also built the wall, strung the barbed wire and made the death strip, and so hindered unity.'' Back in the city, one German spoke for millions: `` Ich Verstehe diese <PERSON> Mauer </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicht </PERSON>.'' `` I do n't understand this Wall.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Next month's superpower summit, conceived as a casual, get-acquainted session, is being swamped by the upheaval in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and reshaped into a politically charged meeting with an uncertain outcome. While struggling to keep expectations modest, White House officials acknowledge that the dizzying events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and elsewhere have infused more drama into the meeting between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` We are aware of these expectations,'' a senior administration official said. `` I think it's human nature that when an American and Soviet president get together, naturally the world is glued to the television screens.'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and the surge of East Germans to the West, add `` a new sense of urgency and a new dimension'' to the talks. Moving beyond the concept of a low-stakes get-together, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now says he will use the summit to advance the process of reform and democracy. The Soviets say the meeting could produce a timetable for resolving key issues facing the two superpowers. Along those lines, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the summit will `` give a push'' to all of the U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations but will not produce actual formulas for reductions. Whereas <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> originally described the meeting merely as an opportunity to put his feet up and chat with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the president says he will explore `` opportunities to move beyond containment in U.S.-Soviet relations, to find areas of mutual advance in our relationship.'' On the other hand, the rising public expectations have prompted words of caution from both sides. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have begun talking publicly about what they will not do _ as well as what they will do. Both sides say they do not expect to sign any new agreements. `` We're not meeting to negotiate the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last week. `` The peoples of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are speaking their own minds about that future.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, staking out similar ground, said any talk about German reunification would be viewed as outside interference; and that any gloating that socialism had failed would be `` wishful thinking.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said reunification `` is a matter for the people of the Germanys to determine.'' Both leaders have expressed hopes for a calm and peaceful period of change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may codify that sentiment by making a joint pledge at the summit not to interfere in the events of Eastern and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are to hold more than eight hours of talks, aside from meals together, over two days, Dec. 2 and 3. They will meet in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> on warships, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guided missile cruiser <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, flagship of the 6th Fleet, and the Soviet missile cruiser Slava, which has been specially outfitted for the meeting. The ships will be anchored about 1,000 feet off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. In line with the official strategy of keeping expectations low, the senior administration official said, `` I do n't think the character of the meeting or the president's objectives have changed. `` What has changed is the profundity of the events that have been occurring these last two months in the center of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said the official, insisting on anonymity. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the Soviets traditionally play up expectations for summits while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tries to keep them low. `` I suspect the reality is somewhere in the middle,'' he said. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` wants to get a firsthand sense of what the limits are. What is perestroika -LRB- the Soviet program of economic reform -RRB-? Where is it heading? What are the goals? What are the pitfalls?'' To allay fears that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was adopting a go-it-alone approach, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked by telephone Friday with the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and promised more discussions before the summit. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` does n't want to get into the trap of two emperors deciding the future of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' There are intense preparations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the summit, including a concerted effort to prepare <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for any surprises <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> may spring, as he has done at previous summits. `` It's like a debate. You always have to game-plan every major argument on every important issue that your opponent could use,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a specialist on U.S.-Soviet relations at the Center for Strategic and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` The president will be ready,'' the senior administration official said. He said the administration was anticipating `` all the issues that may come up.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Obviously, if President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> makes a proposal, the president will say, ` Well, that's very interesting, why do you feel that way and what's your reasoning?' and he'll give him his points of view and his ideas and say, ` We'll take these matters up with the allies and we'll talk about them again at our next summit.'''

<TEXT>
 The space shuttle launch team was about 12 hours behind schedule Saturday as it worked toward starting the countdown for the Thanksgiving Eve liftoff of shuttle Discovery, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's a very tight schedule, but we're still targeting the launch for Wednesday the 22nd,'' said space agency spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, who blamed the delay on `` a bunch of little things.'' The secret military mission, which sources said will include the deployment of a spy satellite, is expected to last four days. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said launch officials were assessing where the lost time could be made up before the scheduled 4 p.m. Sunday countdown start, and `` we'll regroup tomorrow morning and see where we stand.'' Launch crews might be able pick up some time by speeding up the engine closeout Sunday, she said. Some time also might be made up by reducing the number of hours of contingency hold time included in the countdown. Time was lost during the week when engineers had to replace an electronic control box on one of Discovery's two solid fuel booster rockets, and `` a bunch of other little things also put us behind,'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. She said that if officials decide Sunday that they ca n't make a Wednesday launch, they could delay the liftoff until Thursday, or put it off two days until Friday to allow most workers to spend Thanksgiving at home. `` We'll look at the weather forecast for Friday and the weekend, and if it looks good, we might reschedule for Friday,'' she said. `` But we have not ruled out a Thanksgiving liftoff.'' Because the flight is classified, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> have said only that the launch will occur between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. They will not make the exact time public until just nine minutes before the planned liftoff. Except for brief announcements on the shuttle reaching orbit and on the landing time, there will be a news blackout during the mission unless something major goes wrong. The flight is expected to last four days. Sources close to the project said Discovery's payload is an intelligence satellite that will be able to listen in on communications networks of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries. The astronaut crew members will be commander <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Story </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>.

 In the first frenzied hours after <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON> was kidnapped a year ago Sunday, volunteers and parents of other missing children printed and distributed 42,000 fliers bearing her image. Millions of fliers later, <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> is still missing, but efforts by the volunteers, children's groups, police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> continue strong. More than ever, parents of kidnapped children nationwide are turning to each other for help in mobilizing community support and publicity. Brought together by one of the cruelest of crimes, they also are comforting each other when the waiting becomes too much and dark thoughts swirl through their minds. A long table in the Garecht home is filled with newspaper clippings and fliers of <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> and others who have disappeared and are feared to be victims of molesters and psychopaths. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON> chain-smokes in the dining room near a portrait of her daughter, who's 10 now _ if she lives. `` As more time goes on, it becomes harder to believe that we can find her,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON> said. `` The one good thing about the one-year anniversary is it's putting her and her abductor back in the news. We're hopeful that will have some effect toward solving the case. `` I'm kind of dreading next week, though. Between having passed the one-year mark and Thanksgiving coming, I'm kind of planning in advance to be depressed.'' The telephone rings. It's <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Borer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, whose son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, vanished last April. The women, linked by tragedies 2,000 miles apart, speak briefly and agree to talk again later. Mrs. <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON> also keeps in touch with the families of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>, an 11-year-old missing from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and Amber Swartz-Garcia, 9, and <PERSON> Ilene </PERSON> <PERSON> Misheloff </PERSON>, 14, two other missing <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> girls. `` I have found that to be able to help somebody else with this kind of situation has been very helpful for me,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Garecht </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Michaela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate the search for her daughter and assist other parents of missing children. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, has recorded 511 abductions by strangers since it opened in June 1984. Of those, 158 children were found alive, 112 dead. Most were sexually abused, authorities say. The non-profit center says its figures do not represent the scope of the problem of missing children in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It contends many more cases exist than are reported to the group. Stranger abductions are a small percentage of the 23,899 children who have been reported missing over the past five years, according to the national center. Nearly half are believed to be runaways and `` throwaways.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, who led the original flier effort for <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON>, is one of the parents of kidnap victims who have been involved in other children's cases too. His son <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> was believed kidnapped nearly six years ago and has never been found. Last week, he was in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, in response to a request from police looking for another missing child _ 5-year-old <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suleski </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Kevin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> along with his wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, also visited <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, earlier this month, helping organize the search for <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wetterling </PERSON>, an 11-year-old reported abducted at gunpoint near his rural home Oct. 22. `` We have an abduction response team that helps families and communities to distribute fliers and bring a central place and some sanity to the situation,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. `` People rush out to help and often do n't know what's happening, and there's often a lot of cross efforts.'' <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON>, whose name is pronounced Mi-KAY-la and who was called <PERSON> Kayla </PERSON> for short, had gone with a girlfriend on their scooters to a neighborhood market. After coming out of the store, <PERSON> Michaela </PERSON> noticed one of the scooters had been moved.

 A few blocks from the Kremlin, shoppers push grocery carts through supermarket aisles lined with an astonishing array of food, from powdered soup mixes to dried seaweed for sushi. Sugar, rationed throughout the country, was marked down last week. And there was plenty of beef and soap, now rationed just outside the city and practically never found in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s regular stores. In a shortage-plagued city, such a store might seem like a mirage. For most, it is. The new market, popularly known as <ORGANIZATION> Stockmann </ORGANIZATION>'s for the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> department store that established it as a Finnish-Soviet joint venture, is not meant for Soviets with rubles. It is one of the cruelest ironies of Soviet life that as food and consumer goods have disappeared from ordinary stores throughout the country, foreign residents of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> can live better than ever _ provided they have the plastic to pay for it. In Year 5 of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, everyday items such as tea and matches are rationed or simply nonexistent in many Soviet cities. But foreigners can purchase fresh advocados airlifted from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for $ 3.40 apiece or papayas for $ 4.50, thanks to a <LOCATION> Swiss-Soviet </LOCATION> joint venture that opened here last year. Fresh cheeses and cold cuts are specialties at <LOCATION> Spar </LOCATION>, a new German market on the Garden Ring Road. <ORGANIZATION> Stockmann </ORGANIZATION>, which for years has shipped everything from apples to automobiles by rail to members of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s foreign community, opened its joint venture supermarket, which it named <PERSON> Kalinka </PERSON>, with Soviet partners in mid-September. The glass-fronted former clothing store near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Paveletsky train station was besieged the day it opened by more than 500 eager shoppers, tempted by two truckloads of foreign foodstuffs. `` Many Russians tried to come in on the first day but found it very frustrating they could n't buy anything,'' said the store's assistant manager, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Menard </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I fully understand their frustration. All transactions are by major Western credit card, which effectively eliminates even those Soviets who, through the black market or other means, carry hard currency. Now Muscovites who must line up to buy potatoes and evil-smelling sausage sarcastically dubbed `` dog's delight,'' gawk as foreigners haul bags of fresh pineapples and kiwi fruit, frozen beef goulash and canned Coca-Cola to their waiting Volvos and Toyotas. A teen-age girl stands at <LOCATION> Kalinka </LOCATION>'s door to inform anyone inquiring that the store does not accept rubles, which can not be converted into other currencies like dollars or Deutschmarks and exported as profits. Opaque blinds on the windows conceal the treasures within. The loosening of state controls on all business enterprise and the active encouragement of joint ventures with Western entrepreneurs have spawned a rush to relieve the fast-growing foreign community of its hard currency: _ Anyone with the yen, or the dollars, can glide through <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in a 23-foot-long silver-gray <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> stretch limousine, thanks to a joint venture started by a U.S.-based Soviet emigre, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondarenko </PERSON> For $ 32, the car is yours for an hour, along with its built-in bar, liveried Russian chauffeur, video player and even a tape of <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>'s ballet `` <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>.'' _ At the refurbished <ORGANIZATION> Savoy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> near the Bolshoi Theater, guests dine under the Faberge ceiling that once looked down on the Russian aristocracy liquidated by the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution For those seeking to ruin themselves like nobles in <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>'s `` War and Peace,'' there's even a casino. Price of a luxury two-bedroom suite: $ 540 a night. Not a single Soviet has checked in since the hotel reopened after a yearlong refit. _ The erstwhile capital of the worldwide proletarian revolution is even getting its own golf course, thanks to former Swedish hockey star and enterpreneur <PERSON> Sven </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumba </PERSON> The initiation fee is $ 20,000, with annual dues of $ 2,000 per member. For long-time foreign residents, this new Soviet `` dolce vita'' often seems a dream. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> posting has been synonymous with privation, and until as recently as two years ago, most diplomats, business people and journalists with Western cash could only shop in the state-run Soviet `` Beriozka'' shops, which because of uncertain supply and limited selection were dubbed `` booze and cookie stores.'' But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms have unleashed a ravenous Soviet appetite for `` valyuta,'' or convertible foreign currency. Cooperative restaurants, car rental companies, auto service centers, a printing company, dental clinic, office supply stores and even a facsimile newsletter have appeared in recent months. Many old frustrations remain, but foreigners in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> unabashedly love the improvements. `` I come here just for the ambiance,'' joked American homemaker and three-year <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> veteran <PERSON> Margy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> as she maneuvered her supermarket cart by a freezer chest at <LOCATION> Kalinka </LOCATION> crammed with several brands of french fries. In contrast, a Muscovite named <PERSON> Gavrilov </PERSON> recently expressed his ire in a letter to a weekly newspaper: `` It's hard to put up with the fact that the best of everything in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> -LRB- and in the country as well -RRB- is for foreigners: hotels, special stores, etc. This is n't due to traditional hospitality _ it's because of our poverty and the servility before the rich that this engenders. It's also because of the Kremlin's hunger for foreign currency and a new willingness to do business with venture capitalists from abroad who were once denounced for exploiting workers. The result is often tableaux that make one wonder what seven decades of socialist equality have wrought. In a scene seemingly straight from the film `` Doctor Zhivago,'' diners at the Savoy savor noisettes of wild boar in port wine and sour cream sauce for $ 23 a plate. On the other side of the gauzy curtain, Russians line up in the street to buy a plateful of boiled dumplings and a cup of hot tea. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulov </PERSON>, a self-described `` security guard,'' keeps the curious away from the hotel. As he stood outside the door one day, chatting with a foreign visitor, a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> ambled by and tried to glance inside. `` Foreign money only,'' <PERSON> Shulov </PERSON> droned. `` Can I just look?'' the man asked. `` You want to look at something, go to a museum,'' Shulov snapped.

 A civil defense commander says he has room at his training center for at least 200 East Germans returning to their Communist homeland, but no one is banging down the door. `` We expect more to come as Christmas and New Year approach,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeis </PERSON> said Friday over a camp lunch of soup, a roll and East German beer. `` It needs some time to develop. The weather is getting colder.'' As of Friday, only 14 people had turned up at the reception center normally used to train civil defense recruits in this drab industrial city 25 miles east of the West German border town of <LOCATION> Helmstedt </LOCATION>. More than 200,000 East Germans have arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year. In the new reform mood of the past two weeks, the government has urged the refugees and emigres to come home. Nationwide figures are sketchy, but they suggest that perhaps several hundred former refugees or emigres have taken advantage of the invitation to return. The East German government hastily set up centers to welcome back up to 10,000 returnees. But of the 18 reception centers opened Monday in <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION> district, all but two had closed by Friday for lack of business. A returnee arriving Thursday evening by train in <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION>, about an hour's ride from the West German border, would have been directed to an apprentices' residence, a brisk 15-minute walk from the train station. But the home had gone back to its original purpose earlier in the day after only seven returnees showed up. `` Our 350 apprentices were angry that they had to interrupt their training for people who had turned their backs on us,'' said residence supervisor <PERSON> Hans-Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedebold </PERSON>, 32. `` That's understandable. <PERSON> Romeis </PERSON> predicts a bigger inflow of disoriented, needy returnees in the coming weeks as East Germans find a new life is not so easy to build in capitalist <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The few East Germans who had turned up to enjoy <PERSON> Romeis </PERSON>' hospitality included a family of six who ran out of money and were unwelcome with their West German relations, and two teen-agers who were obeying parents' orders to end their two-week adventure in the West <PERSON> Klaus-Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON>, 16, and <PERSON> Matthias </PERSON> <PERSON> Langner </PERSON>, 15, fled on a motorcycle via <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on Nov. 4, just five days before <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s surprise decision to open its borders. In a refugee camp near <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> they received clothes and about $ 100 from the government. `` We just stayed lazy and rode around the country,'' <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Matthias </PERSON>' parents, taking advantage of the new travel freedom, crossed the border, found the boys in the refugee camp on Thursday and told them to come home. <PERSON> Matthias </PERSON> <PERSON> Paessler </PERSON> made his own decision to return after a year and a half in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` It's not bad over there but you dream too much about making a career and all that,'' said <PERSON> Paessler </PERSON>. `` Back here, it's more secure.'' Living in a small Bavarian village with his family proved frustrating. `` The young people were cold,'' he said. `` They gave you strange looks if you did n't smoke hash with them. The girls had this attitude of ` I'm so rich.''' He worked odd jobs and made enough money to visit <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, but could n't afford his own apartment in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s extremely tight housing market.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WASHINGTON </LOCATION> _ The pay raise and ethics bill <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sent President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> early Saturday has less pay and ethics for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ and many senators say their decision to take less of both will haunt them. `` We have done exactly the wrong thing,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo. `` We have failed. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders spent Friday imploring their colleagues to accept the plan passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Thursday _ to push $ 89,500 congressional salaries to at least $ 120,800 in the next 13 -LCB- months and then bar members from padding their income with speeches. `` The House of Representatives demonstrated courage,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. But a majority of senators did n't buy it. Privately, it was said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was three votes short. So he and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> regrouped and pushed through a compromise to increase senators' salaries only $ 8,900 and gradually, over many years, phase out the much-criticized honoraria system. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., called it a `` safe chicken dance'' and predicted a new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> salary-honoraria fight next year Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated `` cowardice'' and made itself an even more elite institution for the wealthy than it already `` We have failed the country, we have failed the institution and we have failed its future,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which stayed in session past 1 a.m. Saturday awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action, took about 30 seconds to send the bill to the president who is expected to sign it. The bill gives <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet-level aides and federal judges the same percentage raises as the House <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders waited until only a few days before the planned adjournment of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the year to push the package through. Compared to a failed attempt at a 51 percent pay hike early this year, their strategy gave opponents little time to mount a campaign against it. But consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, a critic of any congressional salary boost, said that when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> blinked at the House package, it opened the door for opponents to win repeal later. `` The disparity now between the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions will further encourage next year a major repeal drive of the entire package and will probably affect the next election,'' he predicted. By careful design, the biggest part of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> pay raise _ 25 percent on Jan. 1, 1991 _ is delayed until after next year's elections That way, members can not be accused of voting themselves a whopping pay increase _ at least not one that takes effect before their constituents have a chance to express their displeasure at the voting booth next fall. House members seemed comfortable with that delay, and with getting rid of honoraria. It was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> who more than 200 years ago suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approve pay raises for itself only to take effect in the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Somehow, I just have this visceral feeling we look better than the other body,'' said House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. `` I'd be willing to bet a good deal that they'll be adjusting their own scenario within a year. Seven years ago, in a similar situation, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> earned less than the House for about six months before passing a catchup raise. The pay package finished Saturday is quirky and complex, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will actually earn more than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1990 before falling behind in 1991. For the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the federal judges and government executives, a 4.1 percent raise will take effect as soon as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signs a deficit-reduction bill that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hopes to send him by Monday. Then, on Jan. 1, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will take a 9.9 percent raise and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the others a 3.6 percent raise. That would bring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> salaries to $ 98,400 and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> salaries to $ 96,600 for 1990. On Jan. 1, 1991, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will get a 25 percent raise to $ 120,800. Both chambers also get whatever government-wide cost of living adjustment is given at that time. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bans its members from pocketing honoraria checks in 1991, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which now allows its members to take more than the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, decided to start now reducing honoraria dollar-for-dollar as its salary goes up over the years. In 1990, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members can keep $ 26,850 in honoraria, the same as in 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reduces its limit of $ 35,800 to $ 26,568. For both chambers, the legislation caps other outside earned income at 15 percent of salary, and restricts lawmakers from being paid members of boards of directors or performing other professional services. Book royalties from legitimate publishers are exempted. Rules on accepting gifts and free travel from other than family are tightened. In addition, lawmakers and Cabinet-level administration officials are barred from lobbying in their old branches of government for a year after leaving office. Government employees who get special knowledge from working on treaties or trade agreements are barred from turning around and hiring out to private interests who need that knowledge. However, in a compromise with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the bill also softens recently-enacted laws on government procurement that the administration contends are too burdensome.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a step away from abolishing the year-old <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program designed to protect retirees against being bankrupted by the costs of a catastrophic illness. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators reluctantly agreed Saturday morning to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> demand that catastrophic coverage be repealed. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator who led the battle to scale back the program vowed to use whatever tactic is available in the closing days of this year's session to prevent repeal. `` Every elderly group in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... has come out loud and clear that they do not want repeal,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., said after hearing of the negotiators' action He indicated he will filibuster in an effort to keep part of the program alive. Repeal, he said, would be an incredible injustice. `` Starting in January, people now in nursing facilities will be ejected ... after 20 days,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said as an example of what many of the nation's 32 million retirees will be losing by repeal Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> also urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to fight repeal. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a vocal opponent of repeal, said `` there was a lot of deep disappointment -LRB- in his committee -RRB- starting with me'' because of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators' refusal to back away from their insistence on repeal. Despite <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>'s filibuster threat, repeal is considered nearly certain. That is because if the repeal bill is rejected, it is quite likely this late in the congressional year that the existing law would remain on the books. Few members of either house want that. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has voted once for repeal by a lopsided margin. Although the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has said it would prefer to keep the program intact, congressional say they would expect President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to sign a repeal bill. The catastrophic health coverage was enacted with heavy bipartisan support last year as the largest expansion ever of the Medicare program. But catastrophic protection quickly ran into a barrage of complaints from some retirees. Many complained that they did n't need the new federal protection because they already have catastrophic coverage through a private plan or a retirement plan Many higher-income retirees were outspoken against the program because they were hit with having to pay an income surtax of up to $ 800 a year to finance most of the program. They argued that such a health benefit should be paid for by all taxpayers _ not just middle - and upper-income retirees The mail was so heavy against the program that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had no trouble voting to repeal, over objections of its Democratic leadership. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> thwarted the repeal effort at first, accepting instead a scaling back sponsored by <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>. The <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> amendment would repeal the surtax and coverage for drugs and doctors' fees but retain coverage for hospital bills. Those benefits and some relatively minor ones, including hospice care and once-a-year mammograms, would be financed by continuing and increasing the flat $ 4 monthly premium paid by most retirees. Even if the law is wiped off the books, catastrophic protection for many of the nation's poorest retirees would continue being provided through the federal-state Medicaid program. The catastrophic program began providing coverage for hospital bills late Jan. 1. In the absence of repeal, protection for doctors' fees and some prescription drugs would begin next Jan. 1. Under the program, a retiree could have an unlimited hospital stay and pay no more than $ 560 a year. Next year, a person's out-of-pocket payments for doctors' bills would be limited to $ 1,370 a year

 A crowd estimated at 50,000 shouted anti-Communist slogans and burned portraits of the nation's ousted leader Saturday at the biggest independent protest rally in Communist <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s history. The magnitude of the rally, the fact that it was officially sanctioned, and the police indifference toward it underscored the fast speed of political change that has gripped this <LOCATION> Balkan </LOCATION> nation since <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was removed from power Nov. 10. One participant called it a `` miracle.'' The crowd in downtown <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, the capital, cheered as sociologist <PERSON> Petko </PERSON> <PERSON> Simeonov </PERSON> called for free elections and freedom of speech. At the end of the three-hour demonstration, they adopted by show of hands a declaration calling for an end to corruption, the abolition of censorship, release of political prisoners, guarantees for freedom of religion, and an end to police repression. `` <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> has left us with empty shops, corruption, bureaucracy and despair,'' said <PERSON> Simeonov </PERSON>, who is also a leading member of Ecoglasnost, an independent environmental group. He demanded a criminal investigation and court action against <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>. Similar demands were heard during an official rally in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> on Friday. The crowd, reported by organizers to total some 50,000, responded by shouting `` <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> to court!'' and `` Down with <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and his aides!'' <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was removed as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief Nov. 10 and as head of state Friday, and several of his associates were removed from positions of power. They included <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>, who was kicked out as the head of the culture department in the Central Committee. At a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> session Friday, deputy <PERSON> Slavcho </PERSON> <PERSON> Trnski </PERSON> launched an unprecedented attack on <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, accusing him of indulging in a `` flamboyant lifestyle'' while <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> fell into economic crisis. He said <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> owned 30 homes, was `` hungry for fame'' and retained power for 35 years through a policy of `` divide and rule.'' <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, 78, was replaced by <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, 53, the former foreign minister, who said in a French television interview broadcast Friday that he supports free elections. The sudden downfall of the hard-line <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was yet another major change to hit <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in recent months. It followed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to open the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s move toward democracy, and the installment of a government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> not led by Communists. The crowd carried hundreds of banners and sketches, some showing <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> behind bars and with an <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> mustache painted over his face. Some burned portraits of <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> and chanted anti-Communist slogans. The emotional gathering in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, organized by <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s unofficial human rights and ecological groups, was held on a vast square in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Aleksander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> `` This is the return of democracy in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, and a miracle we have not seen for 45 years,'' <PERSON> Hristofor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebec </PERSON>, a priest and Ecoglasnost member, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> is going toward democracy, maybe even a multi-party system. It will not be easy to reach that goal, but we will manage,'' said another Bulgarian, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beron </PERSON>. Some banners read, `` We are the victims of repression,'' `` Christ is Our Savior,'' `` My family has nothing to eat'' and `` Freedom and Democracy Now.'' The crowd shouted, `` We want a new constitution!'' They also called out the name of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the architect of East bloc reforms. <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>'s name was also heard, but not so often. `` The one-party system is the symbol of totalitarian rule,'' said <PERSON> Radoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s best-known writer of satire and other prose and one of 15 speakers at the demonstration. <PERSON> Ralin </PERSON> and other speakers criticized what they called `` repression of ethnic Turks under the <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> regime.'' About 320,000 Bulgarian ethnic Turks have fled ethnic and religious persecution here and settled in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Hundreds of uniformed policemen, some sitting in buses at a distance, watched the crowd and listened to the fiery speeches without intervening. Indirect criticism of <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> was heard as some speakers denounced newly elected Politburo members hand-picked by the new leader.

 Ethiopian rebels say they have captured a small town 85 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> and halted a government counterattack. In a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> late Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said its fighters took the town of <LOCATION> Meranya </LOCATION> Thursday and repulsed troops counterattacking southward from <LOCATION> Desse </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. The rebel claims could not be independently verified. The government, in its own communique Friday, made no mention of fighting around <LOCATION> Meranya </LOCATION>. However, the official Ethiopian news agency said government forces `` repulsed recently an offensive by the <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> Desse </PERSON> from all fronts.'' The government has rarely commented on the Tigrean offensive, which began in late August when the insurgents pushed southward out of <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> and neighboring <PERSON> Gonder </PERSON> provinces.

 Hundreds of jubilant mixed-race people ended a year-old boycott of white-owned stores Saturday, declaring victory after the government said it would scrap the segregation law they were protesting. Nearly 1,000 residents of <LOCATION> Reiger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, a mixed-race section of <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, crowded into taxis, cars and seven banner-draped buses for a motorcade through the main business district. Grateful white merchants greeted them with welcome signs and free champagne. `` This is our victory day,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassel </PERSON>, an organizer of the boycott. `` We have shown that we can not be taken for granted.'' The motorcade ended its procession outside the civic center where, in October 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted to resegregate public facilities that had been opened to all races. Control of the council had just been won by the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes easing of apartheid laws. Under the Separate Amenities Act, the council had the right to re-establish whites-only admission policies at <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s main park, library, a sports complex and other facilities. The move was widely criticized, both by anti-apartheid groups and the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, yet the government made no move at the time to scrap the 36-year-old act. On Thursday, however, President F.W. de Klerk announced the act would be repealed as soon as possible after <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes in February. In response, the <ORGANIZATION> Save </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boksburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decided Friday night to call off the boycott it launched in the industrial city 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> also declared that all whites-only beaches should be opened to all races. <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Oosthuisen </PERSON>, the Conservative mayor of the southern town of <LOCATION> Mossel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, said Saturday he would fight to maintain segregation at the town beach and that a `` spirit of rebellion'' is rising among whites opposed to integration. In <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>, however, there was pervasive mood of good will. Reiger Park residents chanted `` Black and white will live together,'' white onlookers waved to them, and smiling store owners shook hands with customers returning for the first time in months. `` <LOCATION> Viva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>,'' shouted people hanging out the windows of the buses as they moved through the city. During the boycott, the city council had refused to back down despite pressure from shopowners. Reiger Park residents generally observed the boycott throughout the year, but some blacks from the nearby township of <LOCATION> Vosloorus </LOCATION> had begun returning to <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> stores.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> launched its last unmanned rocket Saturday to sent a satellite on a mission to study how stars and galaxies evolved from the `` big bang'' that created the universe 15 billion years ago. `` It was a joyful ride,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, deputy project manager, said after the $ 150 million Cosmic Background Explorer spacecraft was placed in a orbit by a 116-foot, two-stage <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> rocket. Excessive wind between 17,000 and 20,000 feet delayed the blastoff for 10 minutes, but at 6:34 a.m. the $ 70 million rocket lifted off from <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Launch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> 2 and thundered into clear skies above this coastal military base. `` It was magnificent,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fenrick </PERSON> said. `` The rocket as it was rising appeared like a bright fluorescent light, and about seven seconds later we heard the sound of the rockets and saw a spiraling contrail of smoke.'' The rocket's nine strap-on boosters fell into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> west of the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. About an hour later, the Explorer was safely in a 559-mile-high orbit after it was released by the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s second stage. Seconds later, the Explorer deployed its antennas and large solar power panels to reach its full 16-by-28-foot size. The rocket is the last expendable, unmanned rocket that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to launch. Except for space shuttles, all future <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> payloads will be launched by either <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> or privately owned rockets. After a 30-day shakedown, the 4,850-pound Explorer will start measuring microwaves, heat and other `` cosmic background radiation'' left over from the big bang _ the explosion scientists say created the universe about 15 billion years ago. `` It is the first space mission ever launched to probe the earliest stages of the universe,'' said deputy project scientist <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>. `` We'll reach back further than any telescope or space mission has done before, back to the time before there were stars, before there were galaxies _ a time when the universe was very young.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> hopes Explorer will produce the most comprehensive observations ever of the early universe and the processes that shaped it to form stars and galaxies. `` It really is a search for our ultimate roots,'' <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> said. `` Our planet is only 4 -LCB- billion years old. The universe is much older. It would be nice to know when did stars and galaxies form from which our own planet and solar system formed.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> once planned to launch the Explorer from a space shuttle, but diverted it to the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> after the 1986 Challenger explosion. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> stopped buying rockets in the early 1980s and decided to launch payloads from shuttles after its booster inventory was exhausted. After the Challenger explosion, the space agency admitted it was wrong to rely on the shuttle. But then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ordered the agency to stop launching commercial payloads and give such business to private industry. Launch commentator <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON> said the rocket that carried the Explorer was the 183rd <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> launched by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, the 189th <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> ever launched _ including those sent into space by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and private companies _ and the 339th expendable rocket of any type launched by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. To measure cosmic background radiation during its one - to two-year mission, the Explorer will use the most sensitive detectors of their types Scientists believe that at the instant of creation, a single point of matter exploded into a hot, dense and extraordinarily uniform sphere of gas containing electrically charged particles. That sphere eventually developed lumpiness that spawned the galaxies and stars. The sphere still is expanding. By measuring radiation from the distant sphere, the Explorer will actually look back in time. In addition to the satellite and rocket, Explorer project costs include $ 160 million for personnel at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Goddard Space Flight Center in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and about $ 20 million for operations and data analysis through the end of the mission, agency officials said.

<HEAD>Army Claims to Defeat New Tamil Militia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government troops backed by cannons and shoot-to-kill orders claimed Saturday to have defeated a new Tamil militia accused of killing 38 Moslem policemen in the eastern <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> district. Fighting that broke out early Thursday tapered off Saturday in a power struggle that followed last month's departure of 4,000 Indian peacekeeping soldiers. According to reports from the area, the Tamil militia initially attacked Moslem policemen and civilians. Then the predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lankan army, backed by helicopter gunships, swept in to rout the Tamil militiamen. About 70 people may have been killed in the two days of fighting, according to reports from government officials and local residents. On Saturday, hundreds of Sri Lankan soldiers moved into six camps used by the militia, which calls itself the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, free-lance photojournalist <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> quoted an army brigadier as saying the situation in <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> was under control but at least 50 people had died. `` The so-called <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been neutralized in <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION>. We have taken over their camps, and we figure at least 500 members of this illegal army were in existence in <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> and are now on the run,'' the brigadier was quoted as saying. He refused to give his name. The government said earlier the Tamil militiamen attacked four police stations within a 15-mile radius of <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> early Friday. It said at least 18 policemen and soldiers and 25 militiamen died in the fighting in nearby <LOCATION> Kalmunai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sammanturai </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Akkaripattu </PERSON> and Chavalakady. <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> said residents reported at least 38 unarmed policemen were massacred in <LOCATION> Karativu </LOCATION> alone early Friday. He said <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> residents, adding up various reports, believed at least 72 people died in fighting throughout the district. The <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> district in on <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s east coast, where the population is about equally divided among Tamils, Sinhalese and Moslems. <LOCATION> Ampara </LOCATION> is part of the area where Tamil separatists tried to set up an independent homeland by massacring or driving out Sinhalese in the mid-1980s. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has agreed to withdraw all its 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> by Dec. 31. They were deployed in 1987 to help enforce a plan to grant Tamils limited autonomy in the north and east. The mainly Hindu Tamils say the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> majority descriminates against them. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was drawn into the internal affairs of its small island neighbor because of the sympathies of its own politically powerful Tamil minority. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was to supervise a surrender of arms by Tamil guerrillas. But the largest Tamil militia, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, reneged on the deal. Indian soon found itself bogged down in a jungle war with the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, the same group that once found sanctuary on Indian soil for its battle against <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Sinhalese majority Sinhhalese make up 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and Tamils comprise 18 percent. Seven percent of the population is Moslem, a group largely immune from the ethnic violence until the last two years when they started coming under attack from Tamil militants. At least 11,000 people, including 1,100 Indian soldiers, have died in the Tamil separatist war since 1983.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the government-operated radio station, has praised dramatic reforms under way in the Eastern Bloc but says they have n't gone far enough, according several recent editorials. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government welcomes the East German government's decision to open its borders to those wishing to emigrate or travel,'' said one editorial written on Nov. 14 `` It is a step in the direction of a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> which is whole and free.'' The <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>, part of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, broadcasts in 43 languages to countries abroad. Its charter forbids it from broadcasting in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> allows outsiders to review its editorials, take notes on them and print material from them, but they ca n't be photocopied. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, says <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to grant anyone access to the editorials and to print from them stems from a policy change that resulted from a federal lawsuit he filed in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> last year The suit was later dismissed. <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> officials contend their policies remain unchanged, but they acknowledge they've taken step to make sure open procedures are followed. Several recent editorials, which are identified as reflecting the views of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, underscore other statements from some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials that they were taken by surprise by the pace of the rapid-fire changes, such as the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall last weekend. For instance, on Oct. 28, the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> said the East German government had made only `` vague promises'' in response to its citizens' demands for freedom and democracy. It praised <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reforms, and added: `` There is a profound lesson for the East German government in the Hungarian example.'' On Nov. 5, a week before the East Germans opened the 28-year-old Berlin Wall, a <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> editorial said the East German leadership has `` far to go in establishing freedom of travel to all countries as a fundamental right protected by law. `` Many of the recent refugees chose to flee chose to flee their homeland because they have no faith in <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>' promise to carry out reforms,'' the editorial said. It continued: `` As one refugee said, ` <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> is making a lot of promises, but we do not believe him. We do not see any future and certainly not for our children.''' While thousands of East Germans who fled the country primarily though <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> before the dismantling of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall have remained in the West, millions of East Berliners simply crossed over the border for a visit before returning home. The Nov. 14 editorial pushed for further reforms in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, including free elections, a free press, independent trade unions, market-oriented changes and parliamentary control of the country's security police. Reports from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Nov. 15 indicated leaders had agreed on some reforms like liberal foreign trade rules, more private enterprise, reduced central planning and a greater role for women. Often, the editorials stress the evils of communism. In discussing the opening of the wall, the <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> said the structure `` has been a monument to the failure of communism for 28 years and last weekend's events are now confirming that failure.'' Another editorial Oct. 7 said: `` October 7 is the 40th anniversary of the establishment of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but for the government of <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> there is little cause for celebration. `` Forty years after its creation, communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has clearly failed to establish itself as an acceptable alternative to democratic <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' Quoting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the editorial said, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> looks forward to the day that Germans will not have to climb fences, freeze in embassy courtyards or dodge bullets in order to enjoy the fruits of a free society.''

<TEXT>
 The state attorney general's office is providing special prosecutors in the investigation into the fatal shootings of two 13-year-old immigrant boys by a police officer after a stolen-car chase. Prosecutors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Theisen </PERSON> of the attorney general's criminal division will present the case to a <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury as early as Dec. 4, officials said. The grand jury will be asked whether police officer <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 54, was justified in firing the shotgun blast that killed Thai <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Basee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lor </PERSON>, both of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday. The boys were shot in the back from about 30 yards away while fleeing through a field in suburban <LOCATION> Inver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> after abandoning a stolen car that had been chased there, investigators said. Officials and family members, who are Hmong immigrants, said the two boys who were killed and a 14-year-old companion who was captured unharmed all had been arrested before. The Hmong are a Southeast Asian people who largely sided with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War. Many have immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since then, primarily to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and some have suffered joblessness and adjustment problems since being resettled. Two community meetings have been scheduled to deal with anger among Asian-Americans in the Twin Cities following the shooting deaths. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told investigators he fired after <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> turned toward him and held up what <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> thought was a gun. It was a screwdriver, investigators said. If the shooting is deemed unjustified, the grand jury could indict <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> on criminal charges, deputy attorney general <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgriff </PERSON> said. Kilgriff would not be more specific. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogosheske </PERSON>, said, ` If they're saying the shooting is unjustified, he could be convicted of murder.'' State law forbids officers from using deadly force unless it is necessary to protect themselves or others from death or great harm or to arrest or capture a felon who has killed or greatly harmed someone. <ORGANIZATION> Inver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Troyer </PERSON> said the department's internal affairs file for the past five years contains no complaints against <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A roadside blast killed three British soldiers on patrol in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Saturday, hours after a car bomb at an English garrison town injured an army sergeant and his wife. The sergeant lost both legs in the explosion, <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> police said. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but police and the Home Office suspected the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has targeted army installations in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> in its bloody campaign to drive the British out of the province. The British army patrol was in two armored Land-Rovers in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Mourne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, about six miles from the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, when an explosive device was detonated, apparently from beside the road, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. The blast hurled the first vehicle off the road. All the casualties were in that vehicle, police said. The men in the second vehicle ecaped injury. Helicopters flew into the area to help the injured soldiers, but three died before they could be treated, police said. A fourth was seriously injured and hospitalized in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. At the British army headquarters for eastern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colchester </LOCATION>, 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a car bomb exploded as off-duty staff Sgt. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> and his wife were setting out from the parking area at the married quarters, police said. The two were dragged from the burning wreckage of their car by a lieutenant who was driving past, witnesses said. One neighbor said the car was `` a mass of flames.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckwell </PERSON>, who lives nearby, said he saw the car on fire from his bedroom window. `` People had pulled the occupants out when there was a sudden burst of flames and the whole car was engulfed,'' he said. His neighbor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouting </PERSON> said, `` The front of the car was blown apart. I could not see very much because of the smoke. `` I knew people had been injured because someone was carrying a white quilt to put over them. I could hear screams. It sounded like a child, but it could have been a woman.'' <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said, `` The soldier involved was off duty. I suppose he would be going shopping with his wife, doing the normal Saturday things.'' The couple were taken to <LOCATION> Colchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where General Manager <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> had lost both legs and was in serious condition in the intensive therapy unit after 4 -LCB- hours of surgery. He said <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON>'s wife, whose name was not released, suffered `` relatively minor'' injuries. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddington </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> secretary, blamed the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to end British rule in the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province and unite it with the Roman Catholic Irish Republic. `` They will never be allowed to achieve by the bomb and the bullet what they can not achieve through the ballot box,'' <PERSON> Waddington </PERSON> said. Authorities sealed off part of <LOCATION> Colchester </LOCATION>, the third-largest garrison town in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Houses near the scene of the blast were evacuated as bomb squad officers conducted an investigation. About 4,500 troops are based at <LOCATION> Colchester </LOCATION>, which is army headquarters for the 11-county eastern district. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> stepped up security at military establishments across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after the Sept. 22 <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in Deal, southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, that killed 11 men. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on British servicemen and their families in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A soldier's wife was killed this summer and a 6-month-old girl died last month with her father, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> corporal, in an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attack. Since the province's sectarian fighting began in 1969, 266 police, 601 army personnel, and 1,902 civilians have been killed.

<HEAD>Frustration of Minorities Surfaces At Labor's Unity Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The American labor movement staged an impressive show of solidarity last week, but such a celebration might prove difficult to arrange again unless the mounting complaints of minorities are addressed. Blacks and Hispanics are a vital constituency if unions hope to grow, yet they still are largely excluded from labor's leadership. Women, too, have had their share of disputes with the federation, but won a partial victory last week in moving the federation closer to taking a position in the volatile debate over abortion. Black and Hispanics labor activists, however, left the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s biennial convention empty-handed and frustrated by what they deem the hypocrisy of federation leaders who denounce <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions seen as setbacks to affirmative action but refuse to broaden minority representation in their ranks `` I leave this convention a disillusioned delegate, but not a defeated trade unionist,'' <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union said after <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> failed again to win a seat on federation's governing Executive Council despite constituting 10 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s 14.1 million members. `` We will return.'' Black labor leaders, who saw their representation on the 33-member board fall by one seat, expressed similar frustration, saying recruitment of minorities for unions could suffer unless blacks and Hispanics are welcomed into the council, which consists of two black men, three white women and 28 white men. The complaints come at a time of clear evidence that the Hispanic work force is expanding rapidly _ an estimated 8 million Hispanics are working but not members of unions _ and that blacks are more likely to join unions than whites. Labor Department figures for 1988 show that 23 percent of employed blacks were union members, compared to 16 percent for both whites and Hispanics. The modest 90,000 growth of union membership last year was entirely attributable to blacks, whose membership in unions rose by 114,000 to offset declines among both whites and Hispanics. `` It is very difficult for us to understand why Hispanics are not represented on the highest council,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Otero </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. That exclusion makes it difficult to convince unorganized Hispanics that joining unions is in their best interests, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Otero </PERSON> and other Hispanic labor leaders said in an unusual public criticism of the federation's leadership during the convention. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said he and other members of the council were `` deeply cognizant'' of the contributions of Hispanics and hoped to soon add one to the council. Privately, some of the Hispanic leaders said they were growing tired of such vague commitments. `` It is a question of credibility,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, secretary treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionists </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's difficult for me to say we in the labor movement are sensitive to the needs of black workers when we do not have fair representation at the highest level.'' <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> said Hispanics deserve the next vacancy on the council but that blacks should not have to wait for at least one and preferably two or more slots. The coalition last week demanded a meeting with <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, who is expected to agree to the request soon. `` It has to come from him, in a determined way,'' <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> said. `` If <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said ` we must do this, I want it done and done now,' then it would happen.'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, in a recent interview, said, `` I hope in time we can deal with that,'' when asked about demands for expanded minority representation on the council. He said he hoped the progress would come naturally through election of minorities to presidencies of affiliated unions, positions from which virtually all of the council members are drawn. Both of the blacks who serve on the council, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Upshaw </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturdivant </PERSON>, are presidents of their unions but prospects for more blacks rising to such posts with major unions in the near future appear dim. In the meantime, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> says <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> must back up his stated commitment with action, suggesting the council be expanded by several seats to allow for addition of an Hispanic and at least one more black. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> added seats in the past to appoint a black women and to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> a seat when they rejoined the federation, but this year allowed a death and retirements to bring the number back down to 33. `` I see no magic to the number 33,'' <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> said. `` It's not that <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> is anti-black or anti-Hispanic. What he is is pro-tradition. But these are not traditional times.'' <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> avoids talk of racism but when asked whether he thought a majority of council members shared his goals he laughed and said: `` No, I'm sure most of them like things just the way they are.'' <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> blames the lack of progress on a system that allows the Executive Council in closed sessions to handpick candidates for rare vacancies. `` We are not fairly represented in the room to begin with, and then the dealing starts,'' he said. `` Things just are n't going to change with the current process. And things have to change.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> was too busy to receive him, but otherwise all went well for a swami who returned to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Saturday to retrace a bizarre flight over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall six years ago. Officials at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s government headquarters on the near-deserted <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Engels </PERSON> <PERSON> Platz </PERSON> were nonplussed but welcoming when <PERSON> Swami </PERSON> <PERSON> Vishnu </PERSON> <PERSON> Devananda </PERSON> showed up in his flowing pink and orange peace robes to present a thank-you message to <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> for opening the Berlin Wall. `` They're swearing in the new government right now. Times are changing and Mr. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> is a bit busy,'' an official at the headquarters explained. `` But we'll see he gets the letter.'' <PERSON> Swami </PERSON> <PERSON> Devananda </PERSON> later said he received a personal welcome from <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> as the party leader left the building, but there was no official confirmation. The swami, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Svinanda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yoga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vendata </ORGANIZATION> sect based in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, was arrested last time he dropped by in 1983. On that visit, he flew over the wall from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in a motorized kite with a bunch of flowers, landed in a field outside the eastern sector and, after six hours under arrest, was sent back over the wall. On Saturday, the 62-year-old swami drove through the Checkpoint <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> border post, offering a homemade `` peace passport.'' The border guard turned that down, examined the real one and then waved the silver-haired swami and three followers through. At the government building, guards smiled cheerfully when the swami settled down on the sidewalk for a yoga session. `` You're very happy now. Last time everyone was uptight,'' he said. In his letter to <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, the swami asked for the motorized kite back. But officials told his followers earlier in the week that it had been destroyed. On Friday, the swami released peace balloons and pigeons at the wall in a day of commemoration that went wrong. The balloons and most of the pigeons flew West and a model plane built to commemorate the original flight crashed twice before buzzing round the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> airstrip from where he took off secretly in 1983.

<HEAD>Congress Trying to Protect Pensions While Avoiding Employer `Bailout'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is eyeing several measures to provide more protection for Americans' pension plans, but it faces warnings that employers will start `` bailing out'' if confronted with increased regulation. `` There are already some laws with a level of complexity that the experts ca n't even figure out,'' said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Calimafde </PERSON>, a tax lawyer and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1974 enacted the historic Employee Retirement Income Security Act to protect retirees from abuses in their pension plans. Already complex at its birth, the law has remained fluid and further changes are proposed. In moving to reshape the system, lawmakers must walk a fine line between strengthening protection for workers and retirees and creating even more complicated laws that could cause some employers to terminate plans. `` Increasing regulations make it more difficult,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Utgoff </PERSON>, the former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which is the federal insurer of pension funds. `` People will start bailing out,'' she warns. The nation's private pension system is huge, with assests of $ 2 trillion in plans that cover 76 million Americans. The measures before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cover a host of pension issues. Some would limit employers' ability to drain surpluses from pension funds. One would increase the premium companies pay to the <ORGANIZATION> Pension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which is $ 1.5 billion in the red. Still others would increase penalties for violations and require more thorough auditing. One of the most pressing issues is regulation of surplus money in pension plans. Many programs grew during the years of a rising bull stock market. Now, the excess dollars are an inviting target for corporate raiders or managements seeking to pay off debts. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., refers to the pension surpluses as `` an almost irresistable, unguarded bank vault. Since 1980, about $ 20 billion in these `` overfunded'' pension assets have been taken out of funds by employers. In pension parlance, this is called reversion. Current law says a surplus can be taken only if a plan is terminated and has enough money to pay off its obligations to retirees. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, has proposed legislation that would require employers to establish a new pension plan before withdrawing money from the old one. Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> has introduced a bill that would allow the excess money to be transferred into health programs. Last week, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, held a one-day hearing in his select committee on aging to look into charges of possible fraud and abuse in the system. Those warnings have been coming from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s own inspector general's office. The acting inspector general, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, told the hearing there is a `` window of opportunity'' for fraud because of lax enforcement of existing laws, dependance on civil rather than criminal remedies and inadequate audits of plan reports. An assistant labor secretary, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, said he would look into <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s recommendations but testified that the pension system has `` never been healthier.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> dismissed such assurances, saying, `` I heard the same sectors saying the savings and loan situation was n't serious five years ago.'' He called the amount of money in the system `` an invitation to disaster.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said stricter enforcement is needed to identify violators. `` Unless we have criminal penalties, severe criminal penalties for those who commit egregious offenses, you're not going to deter,'' he said. He is asking the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to examine some 1,600 pension plan investigations handled by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1988. Only 23 of those were classified as criminal cases. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said he does n't believe increased legislation would cause employers any undue hardships. `` You hear the same argument any time you tighten laws.'' But <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, said in an interview there `` must be a balance between enough regulation and enough reporting to not have fraud and not make it so overwhelming in your effort to do so.'' There appear to be no definitive figures on how many small businesses opt out of pension plans because of regulation. The federal insurer received notificaion of 10,790 terminations in plans of all sizes in 1988. <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Witte </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it is completing a study on the subject. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must not push too hard. Employers already are burdened with paperwork and auditing expenses, she said. `` There is no law requiring a pension fund. When you regulate it, you get withdrawals,'' she said.

 Until recently, kids at the Crook Manor housing project fed their drug habits there. Teen-agers hawked cocaine on the street and in the back hallways. Toddlers played on patchy lawns that were nothing but needles and weeds. Mothers tapped the grapevine to find out when someone was carrying a gun in the project, so they could haul their children indoors. `` Eight murders in eight years'' was the unofficial slogan. But three years ago, <LOCATION> Crook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> began its own Cinderella story with a $ 6 million grant from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Today the big drug deals are history. The place has new sod, new paint and a new name: <PERSON> Galego </PERSON> <PERSON> Court </PERSON>. The 450 tenants can join tutoring and anti-drug programs, field trips to baseball games and a youth group that holds dances. There's also a guardhouse at the entrance manned by an off-duty policemen to keep out unwanted visitors, and strict rules on who may live there. As a result, small children play outside in safety. And while the stain of the project's bad reputation means 12-year-old <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentil </PERSON> still ca n't persuade fearful school friends to sleep over, residents say they would n't live anywhere else. `` They got new people and the place is unbelievable,'' said Angel Roman, a disabled truck driver who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Galego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tenants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The group's members meet once a month, learning grass-roots democracy and self-esteem as they go along. `` There are people here that are poor people,'' said Roman, 45. `` But they are decent people. Now they have a nice home.'' The change is so stunning, the project has won national public housing awards, including one from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> this month. Some have suggested it's too good to be true and it wo n't last. `` It's a very fragile success story,'' acknowledges <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, who as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Pawtucket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> has orchestrated Crook Manor's makeover. `` The most important word in this fight is ` attitudes,' when you convert tenants to your way of thinking,'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said. `` It's a long process, but the tenants became believers.'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> knows that chasing out the drug dealers only moved the problem up the road. `` That does n't solve the national drug problem, but I ca n't do that.'' <PERSON> Galego </PERSON> <PERSON> Court </PERSON> _ the name, like the unfortunate Crook label, is that of a local dignitary _ has 15 brick and clapboard buildings opened in 1953 on a former dump in this industrial city of 70,000 north of <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. For urban public housing it is a small complex. A key to its upgrading was making it even smaller. The original 228 one - to five-bedroom units were reduced to 164, mostly by closing off third-story units The remodeling also included replacing troublesome hallways with outside entrances for each apartment. During the remodeling, troublesome tenants were evicted. Now, prospective tenants must pass a strict background check and for the first six months submit to monthly inspections which their children must attend. Those who lived here during the worst troubles in 1983-85 describe a place where teen-agers paced the road that snakes around the project, pressing drugs on everyone who dared to enter the property. Dealers fought over customers and over prices. Car windshields got smashed when a seller was turned down. One man was shot in the back for turning a peddler down. Crook Manor was a major transfer point for cocaine shipments between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said Police Cmdr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLyon </PERSON>. `` The place was rocking and rolling,'' <PERSON> DeLyon </PERSON> said, and youngsters used drugs like candy. `` It would be like Popsicle land.'' During the renovation, many guns were found hidden behind kitchen appliances, he added. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Crook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> and got tangled in the wildness. Childhood was `` people hanging out. Drugs, guns and shooting,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON>, now 20. `` It was hard because I got in with it. I'm always one of those people that follow.'' At 14 she had a cocaine habit. At 15, she was punching her mother. They fought and filed charges against each other. At 16 she quit drugs but a year later she quit school. Now she is expecting a baby and unemployed. But <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> has joined her mother <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, 49, in studying for a high school diploma through classes at the project. Mrs. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> calls her daughter `` my mouthpiece'' but, urged to speak up, the resident of 20 years said the improvements please her, too. All in all, Mrs. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> said, `` It's a lot better.'' Will it last? `` God only knows that,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A super Saturday for <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s was a lost weekend for its snootier neighbors on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s elegant Kurfuerstendamm shopping strip. For the second straight weekend, East Berliners jammed the sidewalks around the `` Ku ` damm,'' as the street is known, until police blocked off streets to handle the `` We're the ones who feel walled in,'' complained a manager at <PERSON> Leiser </PERSON>, a store with little choice but to push cheap sneakers instead of expensive footware on the street named after ranking German princes of the Holy Roman Empire. East Germans, with their $ 54 of `` welcome money'' from the West German government, could n't afford the more expensive fare. Trash bins were full to the brim with beer bottles, pop cans and banana skins, a reminder that East Berliners call <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> a `` banana republic'' and mean it as a compliment because the tropical fruit is so rare back home. There were no free bottles of champagne this weekend, but there was the same feeling of good cheer and even a little nostalgia for the giddy days just after the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall on Nov. 9. Sidewalk merchants hawked T-shirts and buttons bearing the magic Nov. 9 date and the boast: `` Ich war dabei!'' _ I was there. <PERSON> Katrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupfer </PERSON>, 16, and three companions from <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> said they had each spent all of their $ 54 of `` welcome money'' from the West German government, buying clothes and a Walkman and saving money by sleeping all night in a shopping center. `` When I got here I thought I was hallucinating, there were so many lights,'' she said. `` At 3 a.m., people are still coming and going here. At home, forget it.'' <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> had his family up at 6 a.m. to drive in from <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, and they went to the upscale Ka De We department store to buy chewing gum and candy bars for the return trip. `` It's a little more costly here, but back home it does n't taste as good,'' said his son <PERSON> Lars </PERSON>, 10. At <ORGANIZATION> Woolworths </ORGANIZATION>, crowds were so heavy that employees controlled the doors and made some people wait. `` A very big day,'' especially for chocolates, cosmetics and toys, manager <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Woestmann </PERSON> told a reporter. `` Another day, I'd have more time. Not now,'' he said apologetically, and darted down an aisle. The manager at the <PERSON> Leiser </PERSON> shoe store would n't give her name _ she was just a branch manager, she explained _ but she was n't withholding her misgivings about the new <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> `` The only thing we can sell are these tall sneakers,'' she said, pointing to a rack on the sidewalk, not the place where her store usually displays merchandise. This Saturday, the market was for $ 21 sneakers and $ 5.40 socks, not for $ 215 wingtips or sleek pumps. `` It is very difficult for our customers,'' said the manager, whose fur-trimmed black leather coat set her apart from the shoppers in well-worn cloth coats. Beneath the World War II-damaged tower of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s famous Memorial Church, the free market of ideas was bustling. `` We need a coordinated traffic plan,'' said a speaker at talkfest set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and inflicted on the masses by huge loudspeakers. `` <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> needs <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>,'' said a Seventh-day Adventist preacher with a lower-powered microphone. A little ways away, a dour woman in a blue raincoat wore a placard extolling the joys of free love, while <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishnas </PERSON> tinkled their cymbals nearby. `` Test the West!'' said one big banner _ not the way of life, but a brand of cigarette. Employees offered to swap East German smokes for their brand and found plenty of takers. One West <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> had parked a truckload of beer along the sidewalk and pitched one-pint cans at $ 1.10 each. `` Come closer!,'' he yelled. `` We'll rip you off just like the next stand.'' That got a good laugh from the East Berliners. Kurfursten, or electors, were German princes entitled to take part in choosing the sovereign head of the Holy Roman Empire, which existed from 962 to 1806. <PERSON> Damm </PERSON> is German for roadway.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The silent majority of Salvadorans, who never have taken sides with the rightist government or the leftist guerrillas, are damning them both for turning their neighborhoods into battlegrounds. Fear and desperation have the run of bloody streets barely traveled by city dwellers, who live day in and day out through combat and curfew. The massacre and mutilation of six priests, all prominent educators, added to the terror. Speaking with a reporter Friday in the capital's battle-ravaged <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION> district, the father of a family of five criticized both the government for sending warplanes to rocket and strafe his block and the dug-in guerrillas who converted the neighborhood into a military objective. Asked his name, he provided it, and the reporter wrote it down in his notebook. `` Wait a minute,'' the man said, and calmly took pen and pad from the journalist's hand and blacked out his name. `` They'll come and get me, and I'll end up like her,'' he explained, nodding toward a girl about 13 years old, lying dead six feet away. The girl had ventured out in search of food during a lull in combat and was felled, apparently by a stray bullet. It has been battle after battle since some 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> rebels descended on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and its 1 million people on the evening of Nov. 11 and turned it into a war zone. About 2,000 more attacked dozens of targets in other parts of the country. The fighting here and elsewhere continued throughout the week, and relief workers have been unable to evacuate the wounded or remove bodies. The fighting slackened Saturday, allowing thousands of exhausted residents to evacuate with their children and whatever possessions they could carry. Casualty figures are sketchy. Hospital and military sources estimate that more than 800 people have been killed and 2,000 wounded. In the combat zones, decomposing bodies lie here and there, shiny bloated semblances of human bodies, a nauseating odor filling the air. `` We're not with one side or the other, thank God,'' <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said as she and her family closed their house in the devastated Soyapango section of Conacaste, scene of some of the fiercest alley-to-alley and house-to-house fighting, and fled the area. Each of her family of five had eaten one tortilla with a few sips of coffee Thursday, when they ran out of everything except a gallon of water. The facade of their humble cinderblock home was cratered with bullet and shrapnel holes, the yellow metal door sporting seven bullet holes, and part of the roof blown off. `` The two sides must join in a heartfelt dialogue. They must abandon the idea of dialogue as something strategic,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>, her husband. It is a call echoed by many here and in the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to end the 10-year-old civil war that has killed more than 70,000 people, most of them civilians. In one of the war's most barbaric acts, a death squad entered the Jesuit-run <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the city's southern edge before dawn Thursday and broke into the residence where the rector, the vice-rector and four other educators were sleeping. The victims, all members of the Society of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, were awakened, slaughtered and their brains removed. It was a pointed message to other intellectuals who, like the progressive priests, sought to elaborate on the need for change in a society that has benefited few while condemning the great majority to ignorance, misery and early death. University officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms enter the priests' residence just before the shooting. However, the U.S.-backed right-wing government denounced the killings and said it would investigate. A state of siege suspending most individual liberties and guarantees has been in effect a week. In many regards, the measure does not affect the lives of the poor, whose right to life and liberty _ much less the pursuit of happiness _ has never been paid more than lip service. The measure imposes censorship and voids freedom of expression. It also has drastically altered radio programming _ and the radio is in most cases the poor Salvadoran's only link to the world beyond his adobe house, cornfield or slum. The government has obliged all stations to plug into an official network, on which enthusiastic announcers describe a capital rapidly returning to normal, of stoic and smiling workers and homemakers resuming their routines. `` The government says it's got everything under control, that everything is fine,'' said another man in <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION>, who like hundreds of desperate residents was out looking for some place to buy some beans or bread. `` But we're being badly informed, as you can see for yourself,'' he said, pointing two blocks down the road where guerrillas with assault rifles and a grenade-launcher manned a barricade that isolated the district.

<TEXT>
 The only gynecologist serving an area of 110,000 people has left without warning, just one indication of how the exodus of East Germans to the West has caused a health care crisis. `` This is dramatic, of course,'' Dr. <PERSON> Hanns </PERSON> <PERSON> Wohlfarth </PERSON>, the acting chief district physician, said of the gynecologist's departure to the West from <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON>. By the end of September, before the government suddenly dropped travel barriers, 100 doctors and 500 other medical staff had left the <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON> district, <PERSON> Wohlfarth </PERSON> said Friday in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The district's combined areas have a population of 2 million people. He added that the subsequent opening of routes to the West made it `` certain that the number has doubled by now, and may have increased even further.'' Other authorities estimate that 10 percent of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s doctors have emigrated, either legally or illegally <PERSON> Wohlfarth </PERSON> said <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadt </PERSON>, a city in southern <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, is among the hardest hit. `` In some hospitals there is an emergency situation,'' he said, citing the example of one nurse doing the work of four. But he said vital functions including intensive care and urgent surgery have not been affected so far. This is partly because hundreds of people have been switched from other jobs to replace ambulance drivers, technicians and administrative staff who left, he said. About 300 army conscripts are expected to join the support staff soon. <PERSON> Wohlfarth </PERSON>, a practicing dermatologist and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` personally shocked'' by the departure of the doctors. He said it would be a `` genuine help'' if young doctors from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would temporarily replace those who had left. `` But it is much more important that the many East German doctors and dentists who left come back. Think of their medical ethics and, above all, think of the patients they left behind,'' he said.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who 10 years ago was inspired by the vision of a peaceful revolution in the Soviet bloc, is telling Americans now that he foresees a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, without Cold War divisions. `` The wall that was separating people from freedom has collapsed,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week in a speech celebrating his success not only in creating free unions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but in forging the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc. The end of a divided <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has long been a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy refrain. But American decision-makers are being forced to examine the prospect anew, and quickly, given the rapid changes under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, symbolized by the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. `` The wall itself is a paradox ... it is an abnormal situation,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in an interview. The reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> should lead to a political and economic integration of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in which there are no borders,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He said that with the destruction of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> should be reunited. `` The German problem must be solved, but as part of the integration of the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and not against anybody,'' he said. `` Not on the Nazi model, not the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> model, but a new and wiser model that has to bring peace, tranquility,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983. East European reformers have been inspired in part by the economic integration of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> planned for 1992, said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukiyama </PERSON>, a deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy planning staff. `` If you look at <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the prospect of being left behind as the train leaves the station will stimulate the introduction of market economies,'' <PERSON> Fukiyama </PERSON> said Friday in a speech to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Integration of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is likely to `` heal the divisions of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We do look forward to the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> playing an important political was well an economic role.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a television interview on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Saturday'' that a goal of his visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` to prove, to demonstrate that the changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are irreversible. `` I have come to prove that <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> offers great opportunities for business right now,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. He reiterated that `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is one and must be integrated. Primarily it must be integrated economically, so that it would be a profitable solution for all. If political solutions are followed, and economic solutions are put off, there wo n't be enough time for those, for economic solutions.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s concept of an undivided <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> sounds a bit like Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s vision of a `` common European home.'' And President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed similar sentiments in a letter to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a calm and peaceful period of change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> seek to implement their reforms. The president said he believes these historic steps will make a positive contribution to a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that is whole and free,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, steering <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> away from 45 years of what he calls destructive Soviet control, clearly does not envision a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> under the Russian or German domination. German reunification `` is a complicated problem,'' he said, adding that two world wars in this century started because of German expansionism. `` I remember how much <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the world paid for Nazism,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, noting that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was the first nation invaded by the armies of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. Although he praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was not willing to forget the brutality of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who imposed Communist rule on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the other nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Discussing Solidarity's efforts to dismantle <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Soviet-style economic and political system, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said `` our task is viewed with understanding by our eastern neighbors and their leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` This understanding lays foundations for new relations between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, much better than before. These improved mutual relations will also contribute to stabilization and peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, removing useless tensions,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 A 115-year-old woman was feted on her birthday Saturday with a private party for about 20 friends. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s big celebration comes Monday when hundreds of people will honor the nursing home resident as the oldest person alive and the oldest American ever based on records obtained by the Guinness Book of World Records. `` She's doing fine. She's sitting out here in the lobby and we just finished a private party,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s guardian `` We had birthday cake and we sang.'' The staff at Putnam Memorial Nursing Home has organized an outdoor party under a tent for Monday. `` We have 750-some confirmed reservations, and we have a cake on an 8-foot table,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. `` It'll pretty much fill the table.'' Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> has impeccable records to back the claim she is 115, which would apparently make her the world's oldest person. But the records reflect a sad life behind the walls of a state institution. She was admitted to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> by her husband the day after her 35th birthday in 1909. Hospital records described her problem as `` post-typhoid psychosis,'' a term that is n't recognized by doctors today. She was finally discharged in 1984. Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> has lucid moments but wo n't answer questions about her past. She sleeps about 16 hours a day, has a strong heart, takes no medicine and seems nearly immune to colds and flu, her care-givers say. She was born <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyner </PERSON> on Nov. 18, 1874, in <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> border.

 Tens of thousands of Lativians rallied Saturday in the republic's capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> to celebrate the 71st anniversary of its declaration of independence. <PERSON> Anda </PERSON> <PERSON> Anspoka </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said, said between 400,000 and 500,000 people gathered along the banks of the <LOCATION> Daugava </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to commemorate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s former independence, declared on Nov. 18, 1918 and lasting until Soviet occupation in 1940. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, estimated the crowd at tens of thousands, including <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON> and the republic's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vagris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbunov </PERSON> told local television reporters that he was there because he believed that <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> should become independent once again, <PERSON> Anspoka </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> dispatch did not mention that. On Nov. 11, the Latvian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, declared Nov. 18 an official holiday and approved the rally. Activists at the rally waved placards demanding independence and the demiliarization of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anspoka </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Nearly every fifth person carried the national red and white flags at the rally, the spokesman said. `` The place resembled a sea of flags, a very impressing and spectacular sight.'' He said the rally was well organized, with railway schedules changed to accommodate Latvians who wanted to attend. According to <LOCATION> Anspoka </LOCATION>, police presence was negligible and there were no reports of violence or disorder.

 An early morning fire torched a crowded mobile home Saturday, killing a woman and eight children, while the mother of three of the victims watched helplessly screaming `` My babies! My babies!'', officials and witnesses said. `` We're thinking it may have come from one of the kerosene-type portable heaters,'' said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynor </PERSON>, chief of detectives for the <ORGANIZATION> Robeson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not positive on that.'' Temperatures had dropped to about 32 degrees when the blaze broke out about 4 a.m. in a trailer owned by <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 32, officials said. <PERSON> Maynor </PERSON> identified the victims as Mrs. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 32; her children, <PERSON> Alisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 12; <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 11; <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 3; <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 3; and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dial </PERSON>, 5; and three other children, <PERSON> Cystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON>, 5; <PERSON> Glenford </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON>, 4; and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 2. The Locklears were the children of <PERSON> JoAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> Maxton </PERSON>, who escaped with a burn to her left arm. Her boyfriend, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyndall </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Laurinburg </LOCATION>, also escaped. He received a cut to his hand after trying to get back into the house through a window to rescue the others, <PERSON> Maynor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tyndall </PERSON> also had to restrain Ms. <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON> from running back into the burning trailer, said a neighbor, <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON>. `` She was hollering, ` My babies! My babies!','' said <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON>. `` She wanted to go back in and get them.'' By the time firefighters arrived, the trailer was engulfed in flames, officials said. <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Locklear </PERSON> said she heard an explosion and first thought it was a gunshot, but `` when I looked out, all I could see were flames.'' It was not immediately clear whether the two <LOCATION> Locklear </LOCATION> women are related; the name is common in the region. Two of the bodies were found in one bedroom, six in another bedroom and the woman was in a bedroom by herself. `` I have been told they were calling for help, so they probably perished from flames,'' <PERSON> Maynor </PERSON> said. An arson team was at the scene sifting through the remains of the trailer, which was destroyed. Behind the trailer, hogs and goats were kept in sheds and two lines of clothes were hanging out to dry. Neighbors said Mrs. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> had moved her mobile home to the wooded lot located near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 71 about a year ago and had just started work at a fast food restaurant three weeks ago.

 Mob bosses probably ordered the killing of a low-level associate accused of murdering a federal drug agent this year, authorities said Saturday. `` Mob justice is n't always swift, but it's always deadly, and this may be an example of deadly mob justice,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, said at a news conference. <PERSON> Costabile </PERSON> `` Gus'' <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, 29, was shot Friday night as he sat in a car, the same manner in which he was accused of killing <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent who was posing as a drug buyer. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s death Feb. 28 sparked a manhunt that involved up to 100 federal agents working seven days a week, and it prbably made the Mafia bosses angry, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>. `` It's reasonable to assume all of that pressure could have resulted in last night's shooting,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. `` The intensity of the investigation never faltered. It was a full court press as recently as yesterday.'' <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> also was to be featured Sunday as the country's `` No. 1 fugitive'' on the Fox network television show `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted.'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> described <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, who was paroled in 1988 after serving eight years for a kidnap-murder, as a `` young punk'' associated with the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> crime groups. `` I think it's reasonable to assume organized crime figures were aware of the intensity of the investigation,'' <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. `` I assume that people higher up were as interested in finding him as we were.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office said: `` A rational and prudent person would obviously believe that this is probably a mob hit. The investigation is continuing; I ca n't say that for sure.'' <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, who grew a beard and dyed his hair red while hiding out, apparently never left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said agents at times had come within two hours of <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> but he always disappeared with the help of mob associates. Authorities hoped that by capturing <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> they could make him the first defendant to face the death penalty under a new federal drug law, <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. `` It would have been nice to see him sitting there and squirming, knowing he'd never see the streets again,'' <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 46, was shot to death in February on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> after he went to meet <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> to set up a cocaine deal in an undercover operation, authorities said. On Friday, <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> was sitting in the front passenger seat of a car double parked on a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> street when a van pulled alongside about 11 p.m. Seven to nine shots were fired into the car, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> was found dead. The driver, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sclafani </PERSON>, who had been hit in the chest three times, got out of the car and fired a few shots from his .38 - caliber handgun at the fleeing van, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> <PERSON> Sclafani </PERSON>, 24, was listed in critical condition at <LOCATION> Coney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has imposed security checks and travel restrictions on travelers seeking to enter or leave the country. Police near the border with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were removing Romanian citizens from trains leaving the country and turning many back, according to other passengers. The restrictions, coming in advance of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, began Friday. Travelers aboard one train said at least 70 people were ordered off and some were subjected to body searches. Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has rejected the political and economic reforms sweeping <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, the Yugoslav news agency, reported vehicles with foreign license plates were being checked by Romanian border police and said `` this is a sign of the difficult situation surrounding the 14th congress'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that opens Monday. In a report from the Romanian capital of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said security measures were increased throughout <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and identity checks were being carried out at airports and railroad and bus stations. <PERSON> Tamas </PERSON> <PERSON> Oltvanyi </PERSON>, reporting for Hungarian state television from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, said all roads leading to the Romanian capital were controlled by police and `` people are being turned back at the border.'' Hungarian Lt. Col. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenyoe </PERSON> said that on Saturday 575 of 1,308 people planning to travel from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> were refused entry by border police regardless of their nationality or destination.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Motorists cheered, tooted their horns and raised victory signs as the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> reopened exactly one month after an earthquake ruptured the main artery between <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` What a moment _ you've just got to be here,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>, among the first motorists to pay his $ 1 toll and head across the 53-year-old bridge at 11 p.m. Friday. `` It's something we had to do. Six <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway patrol cars and 13 Bay Bridge toll trucks, sirens wailing and lights flashing, led the first cars in a triumphant procession westbound across the empty upper deck to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Ever since the quake shut the 8.5-mile bridge _ the world's longest high-level span _ <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> commuters have suffered through choking gridlocks on the bay's four other bridge crossings The <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> set ridership records as the huge disclocation drove workers by the thousands from their cars. The emergency also geared up ferry runs not seen for 30 years _ ever since the bridges killed the ferries. Some groups have organized to try and keep the ferries going. `` I'm going to keep this forever,'' a laughing <PERSON> Darin </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzen </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Pinole </LOCATION> said, waving his toll receipt. Many cars rolled by with occupants waggling V-victory signs out the windows or giving a thumbs-up. The joyful scene was a stark contrast to the grim instant at 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, when a 7.1-magnitude quake centered 70 miles away jolted the area, killing 66 people and causing an estimated $ 7 billion in damage. The temblor sent a 50-foot-long, 250-ton section of the upper deck crashing onto the lower deck, killing one woman in a car. Technicians and engineers rushed to complete a $ 2.5 million repair job that ordinarily might be expected to take months instead of weeks. Included in the job was 18 months worth of scheduled maintenance that left the bridge sporting a shiny new coat of silver paint. Especially pleased at the festive reopening was <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassoun </PERSON>, a structural engineer with the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> who had been working on the bridge every day for a month. `` I'm more than happy,'' he said at the toll plaza, wearing his orange reflective vest and hard hat. `` Everything is A-OK.'' `` It's almost like a grand opening celebration,'' bridge toll captain <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sant </PERSON> said, surveying 17 operating toll lanes Although the bridge is back in the commute loop, workbound motorists are n't going to have much of a picnic on Monday because important freeway connections on both sides of the bay are still knocked out. They include the collapsed portion of Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, where the greatest number of quake victims perished. `` We had a traffic problem here even before the quake,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Halligan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the transportation department. `` Now people will have to decide if they want to sit in their cars for hours on the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, or do they want to get to work?''

 Cleanup of oil from a Greek cargo ship that ran aground in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> will begin sometime next week, with the start-up time depending largely on the weather, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the ship's owner went to the scene Friday to assess options for oil cleanup and the ship's salvage The 485-foot <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Reefer </PERSON> ran aground in 57 mph winds and 22-foot seas late Tuesday off <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about 250 miles off the west coast of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> National Wildlife Refuge. The ship had no cargo, but tanks carrying 258,000 gallons of fuel oil and 71,320 gallons of diesel oil were damaged. Officials have n't determined how much oil spilled, but a survey Thursday indicated about 2,000 gallons of heavy oil were in the water near the ship. A lighter slick of undertermined size was seen about six miles to the northeast. Observers in an aircraft Friday saw heavy patches of oil between the ship and a beach, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreth </PERSON> said. No damage to birds or wildlife has been documented, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. Thirty walruses were seen on a nearby island. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has no human inhabitants and provides summer nesting areas for birds. State environmental officials are concerned rats from the ship will swim to the island and damage nesting sites. Burning the <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Reefer </PERSON> to destroy fuel and rats is a possibility if other salvage options are unworkable, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. The ship's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Transcontinental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Piraeus </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, has accepted financial responsiblity for the accident and the spill. The 27 crew members were transferred Wednesday onto a Polish ship that took them to Dutch Harbor. Two Coast Guard C-130 transport planes from <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, arrived Thursday night in <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> with pumps, containment booms and other spill equipment. The cutter <PERSON> Midgett </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> Friday to serve as the operations platform for cleanup work, and is expected to reach the spill scene early in the week.

<HEAD>Worker Records Indicate Radiation Exposure, Attorney Contends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Medical records of 14 Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant employees who have contracted cancer indicate there is a `` consistent pattern of exposure'' to radioactive materials, an attorney said Saturday. Thirteen of the 14 men have died of cancer-related illnesses, and the 14th had surgery for bladder cancer, said attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBoskey </PERSON>, who is handling their workers' compensation cases. `` There is a consistent pattern of accidents, injuries and exposure to radiation that has put these men's lives at risk,'' he said. The 14 men were involved in plutonium processes used in the manufacture of triggers for nuclear weapons at the troubled Rocky Flats plant. Some of the cases date back to the early 1950s just after the plant was opened, <PERSON> DeBoskey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heintz </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on the allegations Saturday, citing ongoing litigation and federal Privacy Act restrictions. `` We do n't discuss health issues as they relate to our employees simply because it would violate their privacy,'' <PERSON> Heintz </PERSON> said. Rocky Flats is one of 17 facilities in the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear weapons complex. In recent months, the plant has been the target of a criminal probe into allegations of illegal hazardous wastes disposal. A federal grand jury is considering evidence gathered in the case, but it has not issued any indictments. DOE is in the process of replacing <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> as the plant's contractor <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is scheduled to take over operations Jan. 1. DeBoskey, a civil ligitator with the law firm of Silver and DeBoskey, said he has filed eight workers' compensation cases involving <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> employees in the past decade. He has won two, settled one out of court and lost two. In the past two months, <PERSON> DeBoskey </PERSON> has finished trial work on two other cases, which are awaiting a ruling from an administrative law judge. One case is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The cases name as defendants <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operated the plant until 1975, and <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>, which took over management from Dow. Two additional cases will be ready for trial next fall, and he is looking into possible litigation involving four other workers, he said. `` Each case is different,'' he said. `` Some of these men have had autopsies in which the tissues were tested for the presence of radiation. Typically, we find it easier to win a case where we know how much radiation was in the body at the time of death.'' The cases amount to a `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> and Goliath kind of thing, -LRB- with -RRB- a widow of a Rocky Flats worker taking on <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' he said. `` She's not taking on an employer, she's taking on the whole system,'' he said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday to forgo his threatened veto and sign a three-year authorization bill that calls for up to $ 938 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` Freedom in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs our help,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said in a statement asking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to sign the bill despite unrelated abortion provisions opposed by the White House The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval to the bill early Saturday as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators overcame legislative roadblocks after a personal appeal from Polish union leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> for rapid financial assistance. The voice vote sent the measure to the president's desk. But an appropriations measure providing $ 533 million in hard cash for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this year is still awaiting action on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has threatened to veto the whole package because it includes aid to the United Nations Population Fund. Abortion opponents are against the provision because the agency operates in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which has restrictive limits on family size and allegedly imposes forced abortions. The Eastern European assistance includes programs for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with a value of $ 846.5 million. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would receive benefits with a total value of $ 91.5 million. `` This plan is both a wager and an investment,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said in his statement. `` It's a wager on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s experiment with democracy, and it's an investment in our security. We should gamble a little on freedom.'' `` I urge the president to sign this bill _ before <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> leaves this country _ and to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a full partner in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s struggle for freedom,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said Saturday it completed `` open and cordial'' talks this week with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> on the appointment of new bishops in the Communist country. The talks, from Tuesday through Thursday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, focused on `` issues concerning the life of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and, in particular, several bishops' nominations,'' the statement said. `` The results of the talks will be presented to respective higher authorities for further consideration,'' it said.

In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> succeeded in placing three new bishops in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the first new bishops there in 15 years. An estimated 10,000 Czechoslovak pilgrims were allowed to attend the Nov. 12 beatification in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> of Agnes of <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>, a Prague-born nun, and the ceremony was broadcast live on Czechoslovak state television.

 It sure looked like funny money. But consumers and merchants have been assured the $ 100 bills are real _ even though some of them have ink that smudges and flakes.

The Secret Service, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the bank that began distributing the $ 100 bills sometime over the past two weeks said they are still legal tender.

 Toys, candy and holiday cheer arrived on schedule for thousands of children in <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION> on Saturday as the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> Train Special made its 110-mile journey through the region's coal fields for the 47th year In <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jared </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> got his wish. The 4-year-old stood clutching a ball shortly after the train stopped while candy and toys rained down on the surrounding crowd. <PERSON> Rusha </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> watched nearby as her grandchildren joined other youngsters gathering up the dolls, stuffed animals, food, paper and games thrown from the back of a four-car train by <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> and several helpers. `` I brought my children when they were small,'' she said. For <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> and many of the estimated 25,000 people who lined the tracks between <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, the train has been a tradition for generations. Sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Kingsport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Train </LOCATION> started in 1943 as a way for <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION> merchants to thank residents of the coal fields of southeastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and southeastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> for patronizing their stores. `` It's sort of an institution,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, a railroad vice president. Donations of toys and candy from people and companies all over the country filled a train car and weighed an estimated 10 tons. Money also is donated each year and goes to fund a college scholarship to someone from the area. Dozens of <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> and chamber officials take turns helping <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> throw out presents. The train winds slowly through the area for more than eight hours, passing small groups of people scattered along the tracks in rural areas and making several brief stops at bigger towns along the route. E.B. <PERSON> Blankenbeckler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION> printer, has ridden on the train since its second year. `` I've always thought that it would continue because it gave us so much satisfaction,'' he said of the tradition. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogden </PERSON>, vice president of public relations for <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> since 1984, said handing out the presents is strenuous, but rewarding. `` You get a great deal of excitement seeing the joy,'' he said. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> has heard plenty about the excitement recently. He stood at the stop in <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> while his five children, ages 4 to 12, picked up toys. `` They've asked me for the last two weeks when the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Train </LOCATION> was coming,'' he said. The train took on added significance this year because of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>' 7 -LCB- - month strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Presents from the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Train </LOCATION> may be the only ones some children receive this year, organizers `` It's gon na be hard; it really hits them hard,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, the train's engineer for the second year. `` It's kind of sad some of the people you see,'' trainmaster <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittenberger </PERSON> said. `` There are some families up here that are just destitute.'' The temperature was near freezing when the train pulled out of <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION> at 7:30 a.m., and only rose into the 40s during the ride. Some people lining the tracks early in the day had no coats, and others built fires to keep warm.

 Western European leaders decided Saturday night to consider financial and training measures to encourage the political and economic changes surging through Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Leaders of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, anxious about the fast-moving events in the Soviet bloc, met for three hours at a hastily arranged dinner at the invitation of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` We declare ourselves ready to cooperate in anything that will help the reform of the Eastern countries, which are going through a sometimes dramatic economic crisis,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told reporters at a news conference after the end of the summit at the Elysee Palace. `` We are ready to contribute by all our means to the installation of a healthy economy, which is the sine qua non -LRB- essential condition -RRB- of the return to democracy through respect for human rights and the organization of free and secret elections everywhere,'' he said. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, speaking with reporters as he left the presidential palace, said there was a `` consensus of joy and contentment, but also a little anxiety and reserve'' regarding the changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he, Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> had been mandated to carry out three measures: _ Consider the creation of a banking facility for the development and modernization of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. _ Study the possibility of a European foundation to train management people from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. _ Open existing <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> programs involving education and training to Eastern Europeans. The meeting gave the European leaders a chance to work out an approach to the East just two weeks before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hold a summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this week. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also will travel this week to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> meeting comes barely a week after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, once one of the most hard-line members of the Soviet bloc, lifted travel restrictions for its citizens and began knocking holes in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall amid a wave of reform. Since September, the bloc's first non-Communist government has come to power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has instituted democratic reforms. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s leadership has been revamped, and thousands of people in that country and in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are demanding change. The summit was expected to touch on the possibility of drawing <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> into a 24-nation aid effort spearheaded by the community for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive body, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, has proposed a $ 650 million program of help for the two countries. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was expected to press his idea for a European development bank that would funnel loans to East European nations. Such a fund, patterned after the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, would offer loans at low interest rates to encourage economic reforms. Reunification of West and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is another issue that has gained prominence with the opening of borders between the two countries. It has raised concern that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the strongest economy in the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>, will turn away from the community and toward the East. Some worry it may no longer have as strong an interest in the community's campaign to create a border-free market by late 1992. On the eve of the summit, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> for `` comprehensive cooperation'' in a variety of areas, officials said. In a note to the governments of the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> _ the umbrella organization that includes the European Economic Community trading bloc, or Common Market _ <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said it wants better ties with the West, officials said. It called for early negotiations on a trade and economic cooperation agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>. The two sides held preliminary talks early this year but only for a limited trade accord. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Andriessen </PERSON>, the community's top trade official, was invited to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for talks. The community has already signed broad trade and economic cooperation pacts with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and is negotiating one with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> nations are: <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> orchestra members, whose eight-week strike forced the cancellation of the company's fall season, formally approved a five-year contract Saturday. Members of Local 802 of the Associated Musicians of Greater <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voted 47-16 to approve the contract, said union spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>. `` The major issues were the maintenance of guaranteed weeks of work and the need for the beginning of an approach to parity with peer opera orchestras,'' the union said in a statement. `` In this agreement, both issues have been addressed.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, vice chairman of the City Opera, said plans were under way for the company's spring musical. `` We're delighted the fight's over and the playing can begin,'' he said. The agreement calls for annual wage increases of about $ 50 a week, ending in the fifth year with wages at $ 1,000 a week. Weekly wages under the expired contract were $ 755. The strike began Sept. 13, on what would have been opening night for the City Opera's fall season of 70 performances. The tentative agreement was announced Nov. 8.

<TEXT>
 A Soviet leader has suggested that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s chief <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ideologist conduct a `` thorough analysis of the past,'' including the 1968 invasion, a newspaper reported Saturday. Soviet tanks led the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in August 1968 that crushed the liberal communist government and ousted party leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo quoted Czechoslovak party ideologist <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> as saying he had discussed the invasion with <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leading ideologist. The two met recently in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Rude Pravo reported <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> said, `` We have discussed the history -LRB- of Czechoslovak-Soviet relations -RRB-, including the year 1968. `` We have reached a fully identical conclusion that without a thorough analysis of the past there is no way to formulate clear intentions and objectives for the future.'' The invasion remains as the main obstacle to national reconciliation and to better relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, pushing for change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, has pledged non-interference in the affairs of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies. All of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact members except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> joined in the 1968 invasion. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, both with reformed Communist parties and governments, declared this year that the invasion was not justified. <PERSON> Fojtik </PERSON> was quoted by <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pravo </PERSON> as saying, `` We must not avoid any delicate issues, whether they are related to the assessment of the past, or whether they are current problems. `` The Soviet comrades consistently adhere to the principle of non-interference. They do not think it suitable to determine how another party should evaluate a historical event. `` But -LRB- events of -RRB- the year 1968 do not concern only us, they were a matter for five <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries.'' After the invasion <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> was replaced as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary by <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON>, now president. The current party leader, <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON>, was in charge of the purges that removed <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and other liberals. There have been reports in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> that the Kremlin recently sent a directive to Czechoslovak leaders urging restructuring and reforms. Some observers believe a political struggle between <PERSON> Jakes </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> adds to the uncertainty of significant changes.

 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, wife of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, praised the heroism of this tornado-ravaged northern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> city's residents during a visit Saturday. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris left by Wednesday's twister and visited some of the injured at <LOCATION> Crestwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> during her 2 -LCB- - hour tour The tornado left 18 people dead, hundreds injured and up to 1,000 homeless. The youngest victim, a 2 -LCB- - year-old girl, died Friday after being taken off life-support systems `` The community is filled with heroes _ people who without ... regard to their own personal danger helped other citizens so that they could survive,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who was accompanied by Gov. Guy Hunt and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who made similar visits to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> after the Oct. 17 earthquake and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, after Hurricane Hugo, also praised corporations that have made donations to help <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> recover. Federal and state officials have promised to do whatever is necessary to help <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, even if disaster relief funds are squeezed by Hurricane Hugo and the quake. `` We're here to get the job done,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` Whatever's needed will be done.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> a disaster area, but <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> may have to do some financial juggling to deal with this year's rash of natural disasters. Parts of eight states have been declared eligible for federal relief. `` Any one disaster like <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> or the earthquake in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> exceeds ... what we have in a normal year alone,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provided $ 1.1 billion in supplemental funds to <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> devastated the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in September, and $ 1.2 billion following the earthquake that ravaged parts of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Oct. 17. So far, about $ 1.3 billion has been allocated to disaster victims. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said he's not yet concerned about <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> meeting its financial obligations. `` I would say that to ask for any more money at this point would be premature,'' he said. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> and his aides urged patience during the arduous task of processing thousands of relief requests from the <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> area. `` If everything works well, in seven to 10 days we should get the first checks out,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said Friday. `` I'll make sure that we expedite these requests to meet the people's needs.'' The state will have to ante up 25 percent of the cost of providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims, with the federal government pitching in the other 75 percent. Gov. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said he expected the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to come up with whatever money is needed. `` The state does n't budget for disasters,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s emergency management director. `` We take care of them at the time.'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> stressed that government agencies wo n't be able to shoulder the entire load. He requested donations to agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, which set up a shelter for the homeless as rescue workers dug through the rubble in those desperate hours after the tornado struck. The tornado hit <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> with devastating force _ winds were estimated at 250 mph _ and virtually no warning about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, leaving a 10-mile-long path of destruction. A shopping center and clusters of apartment buildings were leveled. Cars were piled atop each other like the remnants of a demolition derby. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said 119 homes were destroyed and 125 had lesser damage. Three churches, two schools, 35 businesses and 10 public buildings were either destroyed or suffered heavy damage. Neighbors pitched in to help <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and her family pick through the rubble of their home. The only things standing were the walls around two bathrooms and an adjacent hallway _ the area where Ms. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and her three children rode out the storm. `` I know the Lord spared us,'' she said. `` I woke up a different person this morning.'' Officials said several truckloads of food have rolled into <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> but the city is running out of places to store the goods. `` There's a sense of thankfulness,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` It's heartwarming to see how people have come together. <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> is home to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Redstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arsenal </ORGANIZATION> and a number of high-tech industries. Mayor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hettinger </PERSON> said the city would be able to withstand the tornado's financial impact. `` <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> has a strong economy, a diverse economy,'' he said. `` That's not the source of our concern.''

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved a reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday as the Communist government begged millions heading West to avoid black-market currency dealing that further damages their economy. Lawmakers created a committee to study possible constitutional changes, including stripping the Communists of their 40-year monopoly on power. And new Communist leaders threatened to investigate their hard-line predecessors for corruption and abuse of power. About 10,000 peopled joined a pro-democracy protest in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, where organizers said many skipped the rally to go shopping in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Protesters demanded free elections and a genuine political opposition force. Pro-democracy supporters also took to the streets in three other cities, Plauen, Eberswalde-Finow and <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION>, the official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said late Saturday. It estimated 22,000 people took part. Hundreds of thousands of other East Germans jammed trains and highways into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, creating a 19-mile backup at one Bavarian border crossing and overwhelming public transport headed West. For more than 1.6 million other East Germans, Saturday was a day of shopping and sightseeing in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, fueled for many by $ 54 in `` welcome money'' per person from the government in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s shopping avenues became pedestrian malls. Some trains were `` recklessly stormed'' by impatient travelers who filled the cars two or three times over capacity, the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. People in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> greeted tourists with free lodging, well-stocked store shelves and just plain curiosity. Late Saturday, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> leftists scuffled with police during a demonstration staged over the killing Friday of a woman during a protest in the West German city of <LOCATION> Goettingen </LOCATION>. The woman was struck by a car while fleeing police who had moved in to disperse the protesters in <LOCATION> Goettingen </LOCATION>. Throngs of visiting East Germans looked on as <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police made arrests. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s 28-member Cabinet was immediately sworn in after receiving approval from the 500-member People's Chamber. The Cabinet was named as the government came under increasing pressure to institute reforms and loosen the Communists' grip on power. Eleven deputies are non-Communists, but they belong to political parties long aligned with the ruling force. Reform groups like Democracy Now and New Forum also are agitating for a role in government affairs. At a news conference attended by several new Cabinet members and other government officials, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Oskar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said: `` I see concern abroad about a possible instability occuring in this country.'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> added that the other European countries are not interested in seeing any such political `` shock'' on the continent. The foreign minister also expressed interest in better ties to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. Also at the news conference, Finance Minister <PERSON> Uta </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickel </PERSON> appealed for patriotism in refraining from currency speculation. Illegal trading of non-convertible East German marks has become rampant over the past week as East Germans visiting the West trade money for 20 times less than the official rate set by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` Immediate measures are needed to protect the currency,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nickel </PERSON> said. `` We appeal from our hearts for an end to money speculations.'' She did not specify what actions were needed. East German border guards were quoted by ADN as saying they confiscated as much as 9,000 marks _ about $ 4,900 at the official rate _ from tourists headed West. East Germans are forbidden from leaving with more than 300 marks. <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> has called for economic reforms but ruled out the idea of a free-market economy. The East German <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> formed a committee to investigate cases of corruption, personal enrichment and abuse of power. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as strongly indicating the panel would investigate the activities of his predecessor and mentor, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, as well as other top leaders of the hard-line regime ousted over the past month. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> replaced <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Oct. 18. `` The responsibility of former General Secretary <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and former Politburo members <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> are names that have been concretely identified. We are not covering up,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying by the Hamburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. East German authorities have issued more than 10 million exit visas, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. That means more than 60 percent of the population has obtained authorization to visit the West. The agency said 10.1 million visas have been issued since Nov. 9, when travel restrictions were lifted on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 16.5 million people. About 200,000 East Germans have moved to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> this year.

 Children sobbed and clutched their parents Saturday at services for two 8-year-olds killed when a tornado smashed a wall in their elementary school's cafeteria. `` Everybody's heart is heavy,'' <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinelli </PERSON>, great aunt of <PERSON> Larae </PERSON> <PERSON> Litchhult </PERSON>, said at the girl's private funeral. At a funeral home in nearby <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechtel </PERSON> urged relatives and friends of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsino </PERSON> to `` not grieve as those who have no hope.'' <PERSON> Larae </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> were among seven school children killed Thursday when the wall blew in at the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coldenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> shortly after noon, showering cinder blocks and glass on lunching first -, second - and Services for the other five tornado victims were scheduled for Monday. `` Everybody is very sad. She was a sweet little girl,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Batdorf </PERSON>, a friend of the <PERSON> Litchhult </PERSON> family who was among the 50 mourners attending her private funeral. `` Right now she's not suffering,'' <PERSON> Batdorf </PERSON> continued. `` She's in <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s memory and we look forward to seeing her again.'' <PERSON> Marinelli </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Litchhult </PERSON> family's loss is being shared by people throughout the area. `` It's certainly a community that has come together in sorrow,'' she said. Mourners filled every room of the Coloni Funeral Home for <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Orsino </PERSON>'s service, and sobbing children held tight to their parents. `` A young boy with so much promise is gone from us,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The pain does n't go away tomorrow or next week. But it is in our sorrow and grief, our anger and our frustration, that we need to find a way to help us live our todays and our tomorrows also. `` ... We will have to build our lives again out of the ashes that now fill our hearts,'' the minister said. While the services took place, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> met with <LOCATION> Newburgh </LOCATION> officials to assess the damage to the school. Engineers began examining the wall but have not determined if structural problems contributed to the collapse, said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Germano </PERSON>, deputy director of the state office. `` It's difficult to say,'' he said. `` It's a terrible situation.'' At the site itself, a trio of 12-year-olds from a nearby middle school slipped past police and caught an up-close glimpse of the destruction. Wide-eyed and out of breath, they told of seeing spilled milk and food amid the rubble. `` Two lunch boxes were still sitting on a table,'' one of them kept repeating. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Coldenham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newburgh </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said many of his men felt they did n't do enough for the young victims. `` That first day and even into yesterday things were pretty tough around here,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said. `` We had a lot of people taking it pretty hard.'' Thirteen of the 18 students injured remained hospitalized Saturday. Two were listed in critical condition. The condition of a third child, who'd been listed as critical Thursday, was upgraded to fair Saturday.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The attorney general on Saturday accused some <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops of fomenting violence in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s civil war and urged Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to withdraw them from the country. In a letter to the pontiff, Attorney General <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Colorado </PERSON> said the bishops should be withdrawn for their own good. The letter was released the same day as followers buried six Jesuit priests who were slain in their home Thursday _ the most politically explosive slayings since Archbishop <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was assassinated in March 1980. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> accused `` certain bishops'' of fomenting the violence that culminated in the biggest leftist guerrilla offensive of the 10-year-old war. Fighting has raged in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and throughout the country since it was launched a week ago. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> did not mention any bishops by name, but it was believed that among those he referred to were Monsignor <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, and his auxiliary archbishop, Monsignor <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>. Both are identified with human rights causes and have urged the government to negotiate with the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> to end the war. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> was appointed archbishop after <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was slain by a sniper. Right-wing death squads were blamed for his murder. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s rightist government censured news of the letter within the country. A copy of the letter was provided to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. There was no immediate reaction from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders here or from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The pope on Friday decried the killings of the six priests. Those murders were denounced in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where some members threatened to cut aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> if the government does not bring the killers to justice. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has provided $ 3.5 billion in aid over the past decade to successive Salvadoran governments. In his letter, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> said certain bishops who have `` persisted in keeping alive the questionable ideology of the ` church of the poor''' are considered responsible for `` much of the violence that has devastated <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> for many years and culminated in the rebel actions of this week.'' He said he would investigate the murders of the priests but added, `` rather than investigating things which have already happened, it is a thousand times healthier to avoid them.'' <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> wrote the letter to the pope on official stationary but said he was acting as a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and not a government official. `` I want to suggest to the dear Father, for the security and safety and well-being of all the Salvadoran faithful, the withdrawal, at least temporarily, from <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> territory of these bishops,'' he said. Rebel gunners on Saturday shot down a U.S.-supplied A-37 jet fighter-bomber in the eastern province of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, according to witnesses and airport officials. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> and said he and his crew saw the plane stuck by two projectiles, apparently from a 50-caliber machine gun fired by guerrillas. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> did not see the plane crash, but the air traffic controller at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> airport told two other reporters that the pilot ejected and the A-37 crashed. The rebels, on their clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION>, claimed they had downed the A-37. The armed forces press committee denied a plane had been shot down. The military said Saturday that 784 guerrillas have been killed, 527 wounded 129 captured in the offensive. It said 208 soldiers have been killed and 627 wounded but gave no report on civilian deaths. Fighting slackened Saturday, and thousands of hungry, exhausted residents took advantage of the lull to evacuate their homes, carrying small children and packages of belongings. Some refugees crossed into government-controlled territory at a checkpoint near the northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> suburb of Mejicanos. Fighting continued only 800 yards away and flared occasionally along the northern and eastern edges of the capital, where the rebels held their positions. Earlier Saturday, hundreds of mourners filed past the caskets of the six priests and their two housekeepers who were killed in their residence at <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simeon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojeira </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said they will be buried in the university chapel `` because that was their wish.'' `` They wanted to live and die here. They wanted to die as the leading defenders of justice here did, like <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Tojeira </PERSON> said. Students, fellow religious workers, doctors and other professionals, and members of the faculty staff filed past the closed, gray caskets, which each with a lilac flower on top. Among the dead were <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellacuria </PERSON>, the univerisity's rector and one of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leading educators, and <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin-Baro </PERSON>, one of the region's leading polling experts. The brains of the victims were cut out in a sign of contempt. University officials said witnesses saw 30 men in army uniforms enter the slain priests' residence just before shooting began Thursday. However, the government denied responsibility and said it would investigate. The nation's most prominint leftist politician, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, left the country for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Saturday after spending a week in the Venezuelan Embassy. Other leftist politicians, union activists and intellectuals were in hiding, fearing that the killings of the Jesuits were the beginning of another wave of death squad killings.

<HEAD>Implementation Talks Break Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and union negotiators broke off talks on implementing a tentative contract agreement, dashing hopes for an end to a 3-month strike at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, both sides said Saturday. Officials had hoped to settle local issues by midnight Friday so that striking workers at <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION>'s two subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, could return to work Monday. The tentative contract agreement was reached last Monday. No new sessions were planned for <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> and the 40,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> after talks broke down late Friday in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Rye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, officials said. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, however, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> did come to an agreement on local issues Friday night. The 20,000 <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> members were to vote Sunday on the pact and, assuming it passes, could be back on the job Monday, said <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON>, business agent for <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> local 2222 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> accused the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> of reneging on agreements reached earlier in the week, particularly the question of arbitration for 150 workers who were disciplined during the strike. `` They started monkeying around with amnesty for disciplined employees,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` In a nutshell, we told them to take a hike. There's no way we're going to give on that one.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said 82 workers were suspended for offenses like harassing non-striking employees and destroying management employees' property, and about 50 were dismissed for assaulting non-striking employees. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Master </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, denied the union had reneged on agreements. He said the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> was willing to submit those cases for arbitration but wanted assurances on who would review the cases, when they would be submitted and under what circumstances. Master said the union also was fighting company demands that included longer workweeks for certain classes of workers with no increase in pay and extension of the right to hire temporary workers. The strike, which began Aug. 6, has delayed directory assistance, repairs and installation for <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION>'s 10.5 million customers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and two cities in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. The dispute is the last of a series of strikes by 200,000 workers in 20 states against <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> regional phone companies.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Saturday rejected an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> proposal to exchange prisoners of war if the Iraqis withdrew from territories taken during the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told a news conference that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will not accept any compromise short of redrawing the border to include the strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway in Iraqi territory. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> spoke a day after <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ending a 17-day peace mission in the region. <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> acknowledged that his bid to break the deadlock in peace talks has failed but said <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> and his Iranian counterpart, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, would meet separately in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in mid-December with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told the news conference: `` We consider the Shatt as pure Iraqi territory. When <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> recognizes our sovereignty over the <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON>, we will be ready to withdraw our forces'' from Iranian territory. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> estimates the Iranian territory <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> occupies at 385 square miles, although <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> claims the area is double that. The cease-fire began Aug. 20, 1988, but the talks on a final end to the 8-year-old war have deadlocked. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has pushed for implementing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution point by point. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> insisted on settling first the issue of sovereignty over Shatt-al-Arab. The resolution makes no reference to <PERSON> Shatt-Al-Arab </PERSON>. In addition to the cessation of hostilities, it calls for troop withdrawals to the internationally recognized pre-war border, the exchange of POWs and settlement of the border dispute through negotiations. The channel is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s sole outlet to the gulf. Before the war, the border ran <LOCATION> midstream </LOCATION> down <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON> under a 1975 agreement. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> called the latest <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> proposal tantamount to `` blackmail.'' `` The Iranians are using a humanitarian issue as a brgaining chip,'' he said of the POWs. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has registered almost 50,000 prisoners held by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and about 19,000 held by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> estimates place the number of POWs at more than 100,000.

 Well wishers lavished praise, gifts and good will on <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Saturday as he toured the nation's biggest Polish-American community in search of financial support for his country. Thousands of bundled-up spectators gathered in freezing temperatures at <LOCATION> Daley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> downtown for an afternoon rally in honor of the labor leader and Nobel laureate. `` I have to apologize for the colds you will get tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the cheering crowd during his half-hour speech. `` But you have to understand; we have n't been able to talk like this for 45 years.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> urged the crowd, which the mayor's office estimated at 20,000, to support democratic reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with dollars as well as good wishes. `` We have to change nearly everything in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We have to pass from a totalitarian system to democracy.'' <PERSON> Mietek </PERSON> <PERSON> Goral </PERSON>, who like many at the rally is of Polish descent, said he believed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s visit would convince <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> enterprises to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with investment. `` The businessmen believe what he tells them,'' <PERSON> Goral </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appealed for private investment in is country during earlier meetings with political, business and union officials, even while stressing that he is at heart a laborer. `` Thank you brother unionists,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told members of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> at a morning meeting. `` It's due to your union that I am here.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> provided about $ 5 million worth of communications equipment and other supplies during Solidarity's underground days, dating back to 1981. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told the union leaders he hoped he would be able to offer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unions similar help some day, and urged laborers to join a union. Like a visiting head of state, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was whisked through the city in a motorcade, with excited crowds waiting to catch a glimpse of him at every stop. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, often wearing a bemused expression at the enthusiasm of the response, worked his way through crowds of admirers, shaking hands and posing for photographs. He was honored everywhere he went with gifts, including a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears football helmet. `` My head is too big,'' he said as he received the helmet. He also received a membership in Local 134 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm very happy, but I want to pay my union dues,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said with a grin as he accepted his membership card and a windbreaker from the union. A union reception of another kind was waiting for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> at a downtown hotel where he appeared for a luncheon. Several hundred members of the city's police union _ without a contract since Jan. 1 _ formed an informational picket. But <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was ushered in a side door and did not come into contact with the pickets. The stop in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which with 800,000 Polish-Americans boasts the largest population of Polish descent outside of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, was the latest leg of a trip to encourage <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial support for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity-led coalition government. At an earlier meeting with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he is not seeking direct financial aid from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politicians or businessmen, emphasizing that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wants to concentrate on joint ventures. `` I appeal to you as teachers, to help us to step onto the right path of development,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` We want to learn from you how to develop a country, how to move it from a system that failed to one that works.'' Robert A. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, treasurer of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, announced in a morning meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that his state would purchase $ 10 million in bonds issued by the Polish government. Illinois Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said he supported a plan for his state to buy $ 25 million in bonds, but said it first needed legislative approval. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made a stop Saturday evening at the <ORGANIZATION> Copernicus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a Polish cultural center. He praised the efforts of the Polish-American Economic Forum, which was formed this fall to organize Polish-Americans who want to invest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and to advise <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry how to do so, said member <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Stopinski </PERSON>. After visiting the cultural center, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He is scheduled to go to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Monday. Since his arrival in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last Monday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has met with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, made a speech before a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and visited <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 Western European leaders said Saturday they would `` do every single thing'' to promote the surge for democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and promised more aid to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> get through the winter. Leaders of the 12-nation European Community met for three hours in a special session called by French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> to discuss the upheavals throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We wish to do everything we can to encourage reforms and the process of democracy throughout the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` We're very pleased these events have happened. The dinner-meeting came two weeks before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are to hold a shipboard summit off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had called the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit last week in a move to have the Western Europeans establish their approach to the developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before the Bush-Gorbachev talks. But <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he did n't intend to send a formal message to either superpower leader, although he would talk to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by phone before the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> conference. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Friday at Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, and German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said he expected to meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> next month but he did n't say when. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told a news conference after the summit in the <ORGANIZATION> Elysee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, `` We declare ourselves ready to cooperate in anything that will help the reform of the Eastern countries.'' West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said there was a `` consensus of joy and contentment but also a little anxiety and reserve'' regarding <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. With the opening of borders between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> there has been speculation the two countries might reunite. That has caused some concern that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with the most powerful economy in the European Community -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- trading bloc, might turn toward <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said, `` There is no alternative'' to membership in the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the European Common Market. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, without referring directly to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said, `` The question of borders is not on the agenda. They should stay as they are.'' She also said security matters should continue to be conducted through the two military alliances _ the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. `` At a time of great change, it's necessary to keep the background of stability and security,'' she told the news conference. The leaders emphasized their commitment to support the democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We must do every single thing we can to encourage it,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` We are ready to contribute by all our means to the installation of a healthy economy, which is the sine qua non -LRB- essential condition -RRB- of the return to democracy,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitterrrand </PERSON>, Irish Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> were named to study a proposal for a European development bank to help modernize the backward economies of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They also were asked to look into setting up a European foundation to train managers from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to open up <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> community education and training programs to Eastern Europeans. The focus of the summit's economic attentions was on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, already the recipients of a 24-nation aid program spearheaded by the European Community. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which had appealed to the Western leaders for closer ties, apparently did not receive as much attention. On the eve of the summit, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> for `` comprehensive cooperation'' in a variety of areas, officials said. The Western leaders said they would increase aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> until the two countries work out financial packages with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, possibly by the end of the year. `` We feel we must give more aid. They have to get through the winter,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> nations are: <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

 The B-2 Stealth bomber completed its seventh test flight Saturday, including an in-flight shutdown and startup of its four engines, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The bomber took off from <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the Mojave desert at 7:14 a.m. and returned at 2:31 p.m. The 7-hour, 17-minute flight included two aerial refuelings. Each of the aircraft's four <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> F118 engines were deliberately stopped, then restarted about midway through the flight, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The bomber's crew also conducted normal and alternate landing gear extensions. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> test pilot Lt. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chief test pilot <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON> were in the cockpit of the advanced technology bomber. The bomber was designed to reduce radar detection through the use of composite materials and countoured surfaces, which absorb radar signals instead of reflecting the signals. The strategic bomber made its first flight July 17. The B-2, which is capable of delivering nuclear and conventional weapons, is intended to replace the nation's aging B-52 strategic bomber fleet. With an estimated price $ 530 million per airplane, the B-2 is considered the world's most expensive aircraft.

<HEAD>Southerners Vote on Autonomy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Voters in 13 southern provinces decided Sunday whether to join a regional autonomous government designed to satisfy Moslem demands for self-rule. The military maintained a full alert on southern <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> island but reported no violence in the first hour after polls opened at 7 a.m. Polls close at 3 p.m., but results for the entire region is not expected for several days. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> offered regional autonomy to placate demands for self-rule by an estimated 4 million Moslems. Moslems who have waged a nearly 20-year-old insurgency have rejected the plan as inadequate. The armed forces chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, said Saturday that 50,000 troops and police have deputized by elections commission to ensure a `` fair and honest'' plebiscite. Elections officials reported a moderate early turnout in this southern port city, 540 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ustadz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jali </PERSON>, a spokesman for the successionist <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said there was a very small turnout in predominantly Moslem villages near the city. On Saturday, gunmen killed a Moslem militiaman and four of his relatives, and bombs exploded in two provinces, police said. A 13-year-old boy was injured in one of the explosions. Col. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Almadin </PERSON>, police area commander, said the killings took place shortly after midnight in a village on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Lanao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province, a bomb exploded in the provincial capital building in the city of <LOCATION> Marawi </LOCATION>, destroying election materials, police said. There were no reports of casualties, police said. Many Christian voters are expected to reject the autonomy plan, and Moslems form a majority in only five impoverished and geographically separated provinces. Only 28 percent of the 3.9 million registered voters are Moslem, election records show. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> forged a cease-fire with the Moslem rebels in 1986. Peace talks collapsed in May 1987, but the cease-fire generally has held. Before the Moslem rebellion peaked in the mid-1970s, an estimated 50,000 people were killed and thousands more fled to the nearby <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Sabah </LOCATION>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> flier shot down over <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> more than 20 years ago was buried with full military honors Saturday in his hometown, and hundreds of residents turned out to honor him. An estimated 500 people, many holding small <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, lined <ORGANIZATION> Dogwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> as the funeral procession for Maj. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> passed by. The mile-long procession, led by members of veterans groups on foot and motorcycle, ended at Highland Cemetary. `` You want to see the man come home,'' said <PERSON> Frosty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, who like <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> belonged to the 44th Tactical Fighter Squadron. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 28, was the co-pilot of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> fighter jet when it was shot down on July 15, 1968. The pilot, <PERSON> Gobel </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, ejected and was captured. He was released, but never knew what happened to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>. In 1974, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> declared <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> dead. Last July, his body was one of three of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the Vietnamese government. The body was positively identified in October. Mourners packed a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in this northeast <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> town of about 800 people for Saturday's funeral service. The Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chaplain, presided. An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag covered <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s casket.

At the cemetery, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> detachment fired a 21-gun salute and `` Taps'' was played. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> presented the flag from <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s casket to the flier's mother, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> `` It's another sad chapter put to rest,'' <PERSON> Halloran </PERSON> said.

 Shareholders and creditors of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> endorsed a takeover by a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> utility Saturday that would bring the operator of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant out of bankruptcy. Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> announced the tentative agreement Saturday evening about 90 minutes after a 5 p.m. deadline he and legislative leaders had set. The agreement includes rate increases of 5.5 percent a year for the next seven years, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. It also guarantees the state a supply of energy whether or not <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> operates, he said. `` Those were the conditions we set out to meet,'' he said. Other details of the agreement were not disclosed. The takeover offer from <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> won over two other reorganization proposals: one from <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> itself, and the other from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illuminating </ORGANIZATION>, another <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> utility that sought to merge with <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Northeast came up with a proposal that was sufficiently attractive to us to be fair,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmus </PERSON>, a lawyer representing <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s unsecured creditors, who had supported <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illuminating </ORGANIZATION>'s plan earlier. <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, said the agreement would give shareholders options to buy about 8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> stock, which would make them the largest single block of stockholders. Northeast is the largest electric utility in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>'s largest utility with almost 400,000 customers, is the main owner of the long-delayed $ 6.3 billion Seabrook plant. The financial burden of its 36 percent stake forced the company to file for bankruptcy protection in January 1988. The tentative agreement is to be presented to federal bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> on Monday. Shareholders and creditors of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> must take a formal vote on the agreement, and <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> must hold confirmation hearings on it. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, lawyer for Northeast, said the utility hopes to complete bankruptcy proceedings by July 1. The agreement also depends on the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> repealing a ban on charging ratepayers for <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> before it operates commercially. The Legislature must act before Jan. 1, when the first rate hike would take effect. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> was completed in 1986, but has yet to get an operating license. The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that it would decide all issues regarding the plant, including the adequacy of emergency evacuation plans. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> opponents have cited emergency preparedness in trying to block the plant. Plant spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said operators hope to get the license around the end of the year.

<HEAD>Report: Cost Overruns Threaten Project, Location</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Design modifications sought for the superconducting supercollider project could add at least $ 1 billion to its $ 6 billion pricetag or cause it to be moved from its <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> location, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported in its Sunday editions. The Post, quoting unnamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and independent scientists, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> officials are determined to build the project `` to cost'' because of federal budget constraints. But such a decision, if carried out, could result in a smaller, less powerful collider that would be unsuitable for its chosen site of <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, a remote <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> recently approved the first $ 225 million to build the collider over an eight-year period. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site was chosen after fierce rivalry among states for the project and the accompanying jobs and dollars. It quoted officials who said extensive modifications could renew the battle by states who would argue they have more suitable sites. The huge project, with a 50-mile underground tunnel, would study the basic makeup of matter by forcing bunches of protons into high-speed, head-on collisions. Detectors record the particles produced by the energy of the collision. As planned, the device would be 10 times as large as the largest comparable project in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and three times as large as its largest European counterpart. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwitters </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> laboratory created to supervise construction, privately asked for an extra $ 1 billion for the project to make modifications, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schwitters </PERSON> said his changes were `` not due to flaws ... but to advances in the state-of-the-art technology.'' Without the changes, he said, equipment will have to be added later at an additional cost. The newspaper quoted sources who said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former director of energy research who the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said was forced to resign from the project, projected the cost of modifications at $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion. The newspaper said some <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials expressed skepticism about holding down the costs of important magnets used in the project and said a sought-after proton beam `` injector'' could bring construction delays, adding to costs. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimated more than a year ago the project would cost $ 1.5 billion more than the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate at the time. <PERSON> Schwitters </PERSON> and Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> a study due to be completed in December should give more reliable information. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said project managers were told, `` Either we're going to build it for the figure of 5.9 -LRB- million dollars -RRB- ... or we're not going to build it at all.''

 Demonstrators demanding an end to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> domination lit candles and placed flowers on bloodstained sidewalks Saturday where police attacked protesters in the largest such rally in 20 years. Six theaters canceled shows Saturday night as actors and students called for strikes to protest police brutality at Friday night's demonstration, in which white-helmeted policemen clubbed hundreds of peaceful protesters. Tens of thousands of students marched Friday for five hours to commemorate student <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Opletal </PERSON>, killed by <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> 50 years ago. When demonstrators tried to reach central <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, police attacked them with tear gas, dogs and clubs. One student was fatally beaten near the square, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. It quoted witnesses as saying <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smid </PERSON> died after being clubbed by two riot policemen. His friends said <PERSON> Smid </PERSON> fell to the ground after being struck several times on the head and shoulders and police kept on beating him, the newspaper said Sunday. It said <PERSON> Smid </PERSON>'s parents were informed of their son's death Saturday by two policemen who told them it was `` an accident.'' The human rights group Charter 77 likened the police crackdown to Nazi reprisals during World War II. Seventeen demonstrators and seven policemen were officially listed as injured, although official media failed to report any injuries suffered by demonstrators. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying that 143 people were taken to police stations. Nine were detained on criminal charges and 70 on misdemeanor charges. Twenty-one people were fined. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, the Communist leader of the `` <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring'' reforms in 1968, was detained during the march and released after three hours, witnesses said. Observers estimated the size of the crowd at 30,000 people. It was the largest demonstration since August 1969, when crowds gathered in downtown <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> a year after a Soviet-led invasion crushed <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s reforms. About 1,000 people gathered on <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Saturday afternoon and walked to <LOCATION> Narodni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the protesters were beaten the day before. In the street, they lit candles and placed them and some flowers on the sidewalk where bloodstains could still be seen. Journalism students and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejstrika </PERSON>, a student from <PERSON> Damu </PERSON>, a higher school of acting, denounced police brutality and demanded strikes of students and actors in theaters. At the end of their speeches, they urged a general strike on Nov. 27 between noon and 2 p.m. `` We all feel that something must be changed,'' said <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Placak </PERSON> of the independent activist youth group Children of <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>. `` It will cost us something, but we must fight for it every day.'' At least six theaters reported that shows were canceled Saturday night, the first day of a planned one-week strike. `` None of the theaters are playing tonight and in every one of them, the resolution will be read,'' a theater director said. At Saturday's rally, there were chants of `` We do n't want massacres!'' `` Let's stop bloodshed!'' and `` An end to one-party rule.'' On Wenceslas Square, two or three police cars patrolled the area. As the demonstrators marched toward <LOCATION> Narodni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, they chanted such slogans as `` You were lying again!'' `` Freedom for political prisoners!'' and `` Long Live Havel!'' a reference to playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident. After about a half-hour on <LOCATION> Narodni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, police emerged on both sides, detained one person and told the others to disperse. Other policemen sealed off the square. In a statement and in resolutions, the Charter 77 human rights group urged `` the immediate departure of those in the party and state leadership who are responsible for the brutal actions against citizens'' on Friday. `` The brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators reminds several participants of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> reprisals 50 years ago,'' Charter 77 said. `` We call on the public and on political personalities all over the world to bring pressure to bear on the current Czechoslovak leadership'' to open a dialogue with people outside the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s hard-line leaders, installed after the 1969 invasion, have resisted most of the Soviet-inspired reforms sweeping Communist neighbors in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a surprise move, however, they granted <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> an exit visa Friday so he can travel to <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> this week and receive a human rights award. Swedish officials had planned to come to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to give <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> the prize because they did not expect <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> would be allowed to leave the country.

 Twenty-six demonstrators were arrested and several injuries were reported at a suburban clinic Saturday in the second straight day of abortion protests in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area, police said. Police said 500 demonstrators on both sides of the abortion issue smashed a pane of glass as they pressed against the doors of the <ORGANIZATION> Hillview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>. They said scuffles broke out causing a number of injuries. Horse-mounted police were brought to the scene as well as buses to take away those arrested. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> said five women were unable to enter the clinic for abortions. `` It was a standoff out there,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-abortion group. `` They -LRB- pro-choice advocates -RRB- had the back door blocked off to keep us away from it, and we had the front entrance blocked. There was no access, front or back.'' The demonstration outside the nation's capital was one of several around the country against abortion on Saturday. Some 2,000 anti-abortion demonstrators crowded outside the statehouse in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> in what they called a `` Thanksgiving for Life'' rally. A lawmaker told the group he would introduce legislation to severely restrict access to abortion in the state. Eight people who tried to block an abortion clinic in <LOCATION> Missoula </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, were also arrested Saturday and charged with disorderly conduct, police said. The Rev. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Jetmore </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, said the rally of about 35 protesters was also part of the Operation Rescue movement.

 Hundreds of people protested the showing of `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' at a downtown theater Saturday, but they were outnumbered by those who paid to see the movie. About 350 protesters gathered in front of the Capitol Plaza Theater at noon, singing, chanting and holding signs urging a boycott the movie at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> International Film Festival. It was the first showing in a commercial theater in the state, although the film is widely available on videocasette and has been shown on cable television. Festival organizers said about 470 people bought tickets and crossed a block-long picket line without incident to see the movie. The showing ignited controversy for more than a week in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, similar to protests that broke out elsewhere when the movie was first released in this country last year. Critics have complained about the film's depiction of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as having doubts about his divine role and about a scene in which <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> hallucinates on the cross about having sex with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. `` You do n't have to fall into a septic tank to know what it is,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Avis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a local minister who led the protest. He said he had watched portions of the movie on videocassette last year, fast-forwarding during offensive scenes. The protests attracted some viewers, though. `` It just makes me want to come more,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowdery </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` They're doing what they want to do and I'm doing what I want to do.'' A $ 10,000 grant from the state Division of Culture and History provided about a third of the festval's funding, but no state money was used to rent `` Last Temptation,'' festival organizers said.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee approved legislation Friday that would stop the hauling of garbage in refrigerated trucks used to ship food, drugs and cosmetics, and the back-to-back hauling of chemicals and foodstuffs in cargo tankers. The vote by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is the second this week in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on legislation aimed at regulating `` backhauling,'' the practice of finding cargos for return trips in order to make efficient use of vehicles. A number of hearings have disclosed that eastern cities are sending their garbage to Midwestern landfills in vehicles that earlier brought foods east from inland producers. Hearings also have disclosed that western wheat shipments have been contaminated by previous shipments of pesticides and fertilizers. The Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials earlier this week approved a bill requiring federal authorities to determine which materials may or may not be backhauled, and establishing procedures for the proper cleaning between shipments of allowed materials. That legislation has yet to go before the full committee. Friday's legislation, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Pa., bans the consecutive shipments in the same refrigerated truck of food and garbage The measure also bans shipments of food products in cargo tankers that have been used to transport chemicals and other nonfood items. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, under the <PERSON> Clinger </PERSON> bill, would come up with a list of solid waste items, such as recyclable containers or packing materials, that could be carried in trucks, as well as food and non-food items that could be carried in food cargo tanks.

 The cause of a late-night collision between a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tanker and an 80-foot sportfishing boat carrying 43 passengers and crew members was under investigation, officials said Friday. Seven fishermen were injured in the accident late Thursday outside <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>California Scientists Import Wasps to Attack Problem Flies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists on Friday released 50 parasitic Israeli wasps, each smaller than a pinhead, hoping the pests would zero in on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s growing ash whitefly population. The wasps were sent to work in a suburban <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION> ash tree in the first of a series of tests to see if they can be used in the fight against the problem flies. `` This particular trial is not to see if the wasps will kill all the ash whiteflies,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellows </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, entomologist supervising the experiment. `` This particular trial is to see if the wasps can live successfully in our <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> climate.'' <PERSON> Bellows </PERSON> released the imported predators into what he calls a `` sleeve cage,'' a finely woven mesh cloth fitted over a tree branch so that all of the wasps will remain in one place. Otherwise, scientists monitoring the experiment would have to search the whole tree and beyond to find the wasps, <PERSON> Bellows </PERSON> explained. The ash whitefly infestation is not the only agricultural battle being waged in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Record numbers of exotic insect pests have invaded <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> this year, posing a threat to the state's $ 16 billion-a-year farm economy. Efforts to eradicate the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> fruit fly, which lays its eggs in more than 250 types of fruit, has cost taxpayers at least $ 10 million so far, county officials said. Scientists also are scrambling to deal with invasions by Japanese beetles, <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphids, gypsy moths, fire ants and other bugs found in faraway lands _ but foreign to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are convinced that it's because you are the nation's melting pot,'' said <PERSON> Gera </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> The region's booming immigrant population is bringing in contraband fruits and vegetables from native lands, she said. The people responsible do n't seem to realize their shipments of produce also carry alien pests that thrive in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s warm climate, <PERSON> Curry </PERSON> said One of the most ruinous is the ash whitefly, which sucks vital fluids from tree leaves and deposits a sticky ooze that discolors fruit, stains patios and ruins car paint. The ash whiteflies, which have no natural enemies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, were first discovered in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> last summer. They were apparently imported accidentally from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where they are common. The parasite wasps were imported from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where they act as the ash whitefly's natural enemy. The wasp has no sting, but kills by laying its eggs inside ash whitefly larvae, <PERSON> Bellows </PERSON> said. After the wasps' eggs hatch, they eat their way out of the whitefly larvae, killing the pest. If the series of experiments set for this month are successful, <PERSON> Bellows </PERSON> said hundreds of thousands of insect predators will be released next spring.

Following the report's release on Nov. 9, <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> produced a Sept. 9, letter from a senior department official saying that he was being reinstated to his job. <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON> said his security clearance was fully restored when he returned to the department following an administrative leave.

 A Peruvian diplomat and a <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> businessman were convicted Friday of smuggling $ 6.3 million worth of cocaine into <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in a diplomatic pouch and each was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

The cocaine arrived at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport after a two-day trip via the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It was discovered March 24 when customs officers at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> X-rayed <PERSON> Pacheco </PERSON>'s two suitcases. Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvert-Smith </PERSON> said: `` It became apparent to customs officers that what they were seeing was something that did not look very diplomatic.''

 The regulator of national banks has earmarked 29 banks for increased scrutiny because of their lending for leveraged corporate buyouts. Comptroller of the Currency <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, who ordered his examiners a year ago to begin paying closer attention to LBO lending, said `` criticized highly leveraged transactions'' at the 11 biggest banks under his jurisdiction jumped from 9 percent at the end of last year to 17 percent at midyear. This raises concern that as competiton among banks to make these loans heats up, some may make riskier loans, he said in a speech this week. `` When the marketplace is as crowded as it appears ... -LRB- it -RRB- almost always leads to abuses.'' Moreover, smaller regional banks with less experience in the field are increasing their involvement, he said, adding, `` We are concerned that banks without proper understanding of the transactions or appropriate risk management procedures are participating in leveraged financing.'' The 29 banks now targeted for quarterly monitoring of their LBO portfolios all have at least 2 percent of assets tied up in leveraged deals. At the 11 largest the average was 4 percent. The 11 large banks are: <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office, declined to release the names of the 18 regional banks. `` We do n't want to create undue concern.'' She emphasized Friday that being on the list does not signify a bank is in any danger. In a leveraged buyout, investors _ often managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover _ borrow heavily against a company's assets in order to buy it Critics say the debt can be risky if the company's profits slip. An increase in banks' caution about such deals, particularly a proposal last month for a buyout of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, was cited by traders as the trigger for the Oct. 13 stock market plunge.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns Convictions of Three Involved in Soccer Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge, questioning police evidence, overturned the convictions of three men for violence at soccer games and reduced the prison term Friday of a fourth man. Judge Lord <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> ruled that handwriting experts cast doubt on the veracity of statements made by undercover policemen. On Thursday, the judge overruled the convictions of <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, 25, who was serving a seven-year sentence, and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Last </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickmott </PERSON>, 33, both serving 10-year sentences, on charges of plotting to fight. The case involved lengthy investigations, with undercover officers trying to get close to people suspected of organizing violence at soccer matches. Submitted as part of the evidence were notes the officers often scribbled hastily. Judge <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said police handwriting experts found that the notes included dates and times of statements that did not match those on officer duty sheets, suggesting tampering. He said that was sufficient to undermine the prosecution's credibility. On Friday, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> ruled that the six-year jail term of convicted soccer hooligan <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>, 25, was too long. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> has served two years and the judge reduced the sentence to four years. That will enable <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to be freed immediately under parole provisions. The judge said the violence that followed the 1986 cup final at <LOCATION> Wembley </LOCATION> was terrifying but a six-year sentence flouted <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> guidelines and was too long. Five conspiracy cases involving soccer violence have collapsed over the last two years with charges dropped against about 120 people. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> was expected to begin an internal investigation after the latest rulings. British soccer has been plagued by spectator violence in recent years. A total of 39 people, most of them Italian fans, died when rioting broke out among fans at a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> soccer cup final match between the British team <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Juventus </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Heysel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on May 29, 1985. Drunken <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans were blamed for starting the violence. Violent incidents at British soccer matches this year have included street battles in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, between rival Scottish and English fans in which more than 250 people were arrested.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Estonian parliament on Friday compromised on an election law that spawned nine days of strikes by ethnic Russians and other non-natives who feared lengthy residency requirements would deprive them of the right to vote. The new law requires a 10-year residency in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for holding public office, but deletes a two-year residency requirement for the right to vote, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It passed with 186 votes in favor, and 40 abstentions by the `` Equal Rights'' group of deputies, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not say if anyone voted against the bill. In August, tens of thousands of Russians and other non-Estonian residents of the Baltic republic walked off their jobs to protest the law requiring two years' residence in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> to vote. The national Presidium called the law unconstitutional, but the Estonian parliament, in an act of defiance, only suspended the law's provisions for the local elections set for Dec. 10. The law passed Friday also requires candidates to live or work in the district they hope to represent, a departure from current national law. Many Soviet legislators, especially those well known, represent districts far from their homes.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved compromise legislation Friday aimed at protecting Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from reprisals at home for their participation in the pro-democracy movement. By a voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise under which the 32,000 Chinese students holding `` exchange visitor'' visas would not have to return home for two years before applying for a change in their immigration status.

 The estimated cost of helping local governments remove debris from Hurricane Hugo has increased by 50 percent to $ 90 million, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The total estimated cost of the storm to all <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> programs has increased to more than $ 437 million, of which $ 210 million will go to public assistance programs, the agency said.

 Fire crews injected water into a 300-foot-long propane pipeline Friday to extinguish a towering day-long blaze, enabling nearly half of the town's 1,000 residents to return to their homes. A smaller fire continued to burn Friday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> terminal, but it posed no danger and was being allowed to burn out, company spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> said. `` The main fire is out and the line has been capped,'' <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> said. The fire started Thursday as a work crew was performing routine maintenance on a pump at the plant two miles south of <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> in <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gipson </PERSON> said. Flames had shot 200 feet into the air from a 2-inch valve in the pipeline, which leads to a 17-acre underground storage cavern. No one was injured and the cause remained undetermined, he said. Five vehicles at the site were destroyed, he added. Pipeline fire experts from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> extinguished the fire late Friday morning. Several hours later, about 500 residents who were evacuated from a two-mile radius of the plant on Thursday were allowed to return home. Many had stayed with friends and relatives or gone to shelters in the nearby <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>. A 10-mile stretch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 71 between <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Carthage </LOCATION> also was reopened Friday afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said. The plant lies several hundred yards from the highway. Flames continued to shoot from a valve on a 20,000-gallon propane tank near the capped pipeline. The main blaze heated the tank and popped an emergency release valve designed for that purpose, officials said. Dairy farmer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who lives about a mile from the plant, said he was happy to be able to return home and milk his cows on schedule. The sky had an eerie orange glow to it when he was allowed past barricades Thursday night to milk the herd, he said. `` I was a little nervous being that close to the plant, but it had to be done,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s two-day freeze on normal operations to concentrate on safety ended Friday, with commanders awaiting the results of the exercise triggered by an unprecedented series of accidents. In one case, they did n't have to wait long. Shortly after the operational stand-down ended, mechanical problems forced a training jet to ditch in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The two pilots ejected safely. The TA4J jet went down on a routine training mission at 3:40 p.m. about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, only nine hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingsville </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> unit completed its stand-down, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Duren </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>. The pause in operations was ordered Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, chief of naval operations, after 10 accidents over a three-week period killed 10 and injured at least 71. Under the stand-down order, all <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> units worldwide were to halt normal routine and concentrate on safety inspections, reviews and lectures for 48 of the ensuing 72 hours, beginning Tuesday evening. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> ordered all commanders to report their findings from the stand-down to him. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the stand-down was not ordered because the service was operating in an unsafe manner, but because <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> wanted to ensure that everything that could be done was being done to protect servicemen. For the Norfolk-based <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, that meant the reorganization of training and operations schedules for approximately 200,000 people and 300 ships. `` Most of the ships will be finished by this evening,'' Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a fleet spokesman, said Friday. `` Some helicopter units on base began the stand-down Wednesday, though most units needed Wednesday to prepare for the stand-down.'' Line commanders said the procedures of the stand-down were no different from their daily training regime. `` The only difference is that this is a dedicated period. We've stopped our routine activities Every individual aboard ship is devoted to the safety stand-down,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON>, commander of the guided missile cruiser <PERSON> Josephus </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lugo </PERSON> ran his 470 crewmen through a series of lectures, inspections and demonstrations Thursday and Friday while the warship was docked at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Naval Station. `` What you're seeing here is no different than any other day, except we're not flying,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuethrich </PERSON>, executive officer of Squadron VF-41 at the <ORGANIZATION> Oceana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wuethrich </PERSON> said squadrons normally go on stand-down after the holidays to review flight safety and past accidents. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> safety officials said there was no common thread linking the accidents, which ranged from men washed overboard to plane crashes to ship fires to the accidental bombing of a cruiser. `` Never in the history of the modern <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> have so many mishaps happened at one time,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top safety officer. According to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> figures, 1989 is the safest year on record with 69 major accidents reported so far. In 1984, 118 major accidents were reported. Every year since then, the numbers have declined. Where 1989 varies from the previous five years is in fatalities. There have been 102 this year, including the 47 sailors killed in the April 19 gun turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa. In 1984, 64 people were killed in accidents.

 Roman Catholic officials urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to press for an investigation of the killings of six Jesuit priests in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and to stem the flow of arms to both sides in the civil war. `` We have been sickened and outraged at the murders of the six Jesuit priests and their co-workers as well as the more than 500 deaths that have occurred in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> this past week,'' said a statement from some 600 priests of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` We ask that this violence be stopped. Ten years and 80,000 deaths have proven that the military solution is no solution,'' the group, which included several exiles from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said in the statement drafted late Thursday at a meeting in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. Earlier Thursday, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> called the slayings wanton murder and asked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to urge `` an immediate truce, prompt negotiations between the government and the guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the cessation of outside military armaments to all sides.'' Dozens of religious workers, labor activists, academics and political figures went into hiding Friday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> after the killings of the Jesuits and the arrest of 12 Lutheran missionaries. The Lutherans, including four Americans, were released Friday unharmed, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said.

President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, whose government denied any responsibility, said he had ordered an inquiry. The slayings shocked even those accustomed to analyzing events in the war-torn country. `` This was not the work of madmen. This was the work of cruel, politically sophisticated men,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuccio </PERSON>, author of `` Who's Wrong, Who's Right in Central America'' and an associate of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> D.C.-based Inter-American Dialogue. <PERSON> Beatriz </PERSON> <PERSON> Manz </PERSON>, a Central American specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Wellesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, attributed the massacre to forces within <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s ruling party `` It will intimidate the few voices of dissent, the few voices of reason, in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' she said. <PERSON> Nuccio </PERSON> said `` we'll probably never know for sure'' who did the killings, but he said they will `` make it very difficult for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> without attaching any conditions on human rights violations.''

 Negotiators from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are calling for repeal of catastrophic health coverage for retirees and nearing agreement on a compromise deficit-reduction package. Final action on those two bills, which could come Sunday, would free <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adjourn for the year. Senior tax-writers in both houses agreed early today to kill the catastrophic program, which was enacted with great fanfare less than 18 months ago in an effort to protect retirees from being bankrupted by costs of a major illness. But two Republican senators who had wanted to scale back the program said they will work to defeat the repeal agreement. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., promised to use every parliamentary tactic available in an effort to prevent repeal, which he said would be an incredible injustice

 A third of this capital's 1 million people were reportedly trapped without food and water after a week of fighting between leftist rebels and government troops. Journalists in the eastern provincial capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> reported heavy fighting in that city and on a nearby bridge Friday night. They had no estimates of deaths or injuries in the city 85 miles east of the capital. Hospital and military sources say more than 800 people have been killed and and 2,000 wounded since the Marxist-led rebels launched the offensive against the rightist government on Nov 11. There was a lull in the fighting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Friday night and early today, with only occasional bursts of gunfire. However, the capital has suffered the worst fighting of the 10-year-old civil war over the past week.

<HEAD>The Big New Consumer Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This is the penny-pinching period of the economic cycle, when consumers watch their bills, homeowners study mortgage rates and businesses cut overhead. Even <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tries to trim. It is the mood of the times, a period of rentrenchment, reorganization and correction that follows every economic expansion _ a regular and maybe necessary time in which the stage is prepared for the next act. And that, perhaps, is why the attempt to cut automobile insurance costs is gaining a sort of negative attention. While lower insurance costs obviously are desirable, the effort is being resisted and frustrated. At issue is whether no-fault policies, which are said to reduce costs, should be offered as a choice to motorists in states where fault-based policies, which often lead to costly litigation, are now firmly entrenched. Consumers groups, including many insurers, are fighting for no-fault, or consumer-choice insurance. The opposition includes some insurers and members of state legislatures, but the legal fraternity makes up its stiff backbone. Leading the consumer effort is <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, whose leaders claim that insurance buyers finance costly litigation that could be avoided and that benefits a few at the expense of high rates for everyone. Founded by consumerists <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McEwen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> has plenty of heavy hitters, perhaps none better known than <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Knauer </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Knauer </PERSON>, White House consumer affairs adviser in the administration of Presidents <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, is the project's national chairwoman and at a point in her life when public-spirited citizens often feel free to speak their minds. She contends that there is no arguing that no-fault makes sense, and she blames one group _ `` the lawyers who make their living by arguing over who is at fault'' _ for preventing its enactment by state legislatures. She says lawyers made it clear in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, one of the recent battlegrounds, that `` they will fight Consumer Choice auto insurance to the death.'' Nothing new in that, she added. `` For the past two decades they have sabotaged or crippled most consumer efforts to enact no-fault insurance.'' Those are harsh words, and they suggest the bitterness of the battle. The legal profession says it is n't as simple as that. Involved, they say, are a person's right to sue and a person's right to trial by jury. And no - fault, they say, places a premium on economic loss but minimizes physical loss Mrs. <PERSON> Knauer </PERSON> says that's nonsense. What her group offers, she says, is called Consumer Choice because it would allow the current system to remain side by side with another system. Motorists would choose one or the other. That choice: Pay higher premiums and retain the old system and the right to sue; or pay less and avoid suits with a Personal Protection Policy. Stated differently, a choice between a no-lawsuit or `` sue and be sued'' system. Under the Personal Protection Policy, consumers would purchase what medical coverage is needed, coverage for loss of income, and whatever level of coverage is desired for fire, theft or repairs to their cars. From that point they could choose building blocks of whatever insurance they desired, including loss of life and survivor benefits. Says Mrs. <PERSON> Knauer </PERSON>: `` No longer would a motorist be forced to buy an arbitrary level of insurance coverage designed to protect some other unknown person with unknowable resources and hypothetical needs, with whom they might someday be involved in an accident.'' But how could two systems exist simultaneously? It in this area, too, that some conflict might lie. Those who choose the current system could collect through an uninsured motorist rider, but they would be limited in their ability to sue those with the Personal Protection Policy. Only 14 states now have basic no-fault systems, nearly two decades after <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> enacted the first such law. New Start has a long way to go, and that suggests plenty of fireworks for the decade of the 1990s.

 Cable television's <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION>, which has shown live proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> since 1979, on Tuesday will do likewise from a somewhat older place _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> On that day, which starts with an address by Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to the new session of Parliament that <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> will carry live at 5:30 a.m. EST, the occasionally raucous Commons will open its proceedings to television. That starts at 9 a.m. EST in what is a test run. The experiment will last until at least next July, after which the legislators in the 650-seat Commons will vote on whether to make TV permanent. `` It's unlikely that they wo n't continue it unless there's a major row,'' <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> predicted in a phone interview from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he's overseeing a series of live telecasts slated for this week. C-SPAN last week dispatched a staff to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for a week of preliminary interviews, including call-ins from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> viewers. Among those fielding questions today is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grist </PERSON>, who oversees the Commons' eight-camera TV system. For <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit industry-supported cooperative that says it is seen in 46.8 million homes and offices, Tuesday may prove a legislative tale of two cities, one that enables viewers to see differences in at least the oratory of lawmakers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> still is in session Tuesday, a C-SPAN spokesman says, `` we will go live to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and air that in its entirety, then pick up the British <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in progress. Then, that evening, we'll air the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- proceedings -RRB- in its entirety.'' No video bundle from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is scheduled for Wednesday. But on Thanksgiving day, at 9:30 a.m. EST, <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> will air, live, another Commons session in its entirety. `` It might go eight or ten hours,'' Lamb says. `` It's a good chance for people who are busy on Tuesday to just tune in, just look at it.'' On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> will show taped highlights of the week. The real action _ <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> hopes to show it live _ will come on Nov. 28 at 10:15 a.m. EST, when Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> faces opposition Labor leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> for a 15-minute `` question time'' session. Such sessions, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, are rarely sedate and usually rife with riposte. Unlike the comparatively tame give and take of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, question time in the Commons `` is meant to be confrontational,'' Lamb notes. `` They stand literally eight feet apart, looking each other in the eye, both the Prime Minister and the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ... it's electric. And there's a lot of hooting and howling in the chamber ... `` They do it partly to throw everybody off guard.'' Alas, as in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has strict rules about what TV can and can not show. If there is a noisy disruption, the Commons camera crews are told to ignore it and focus only on the Speaker, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherill </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Filipinos Concerned About Growing Drug Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A growing drug trade has led to concern that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is in danger of becoming the <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Calls are going out for tougher laws and the death penalty for drug dealers. Police say the illegal drug trade has become a $ 41 million-a-year business in recent years. The three largest drug syndicates employ about 15,000 people fulltime, according to police estimates. The trade comes nowhere near that of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s multibillion-dollar drug cartels, but experts here say most of the narcotics produced in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are used locally But Filipino and foreign experts fear the country could become a major regional drug center because of a favorable climate for growing marijuana, corruption and inefficiency within the police and established trade and communications links to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other markets. In October, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> seized two tons of Philippine-grown marijuana worth $ 14 million in what was believed to be an attempt to establish a pipeline between <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Two Americans of Filipino ancestry were arrested recently in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for allegedly trying to smuggle in two pounds of the drug crystal methamphetamine, a widely abused drug known in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as `` shabu'' and said by officials and drug experts to be more addictive than crack. Philippine-grown marijuana and other drugs also have turned up, albeit in modest amounts, in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and some <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, police say. Foreign and Filipino narcotics officials say syndicates have been bringing in foreigners, mostly Europeans, to teach growers here how to grow better quality marijuana. Last year, police uprooted 15 million marijuana plants and seized 7.5 tons of marijuana packed for shipment abroad. `` If we do not do something about this, there might come a time when we will see the spectacle of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> becoming like <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where drug lords even have armies, helicopters, planes and even tanks,'' Sen. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> said at a recent Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing. Public concern over the problem began to grow in October after Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> charged that at least 17 police and military members, including a brigadier general, were protecting drug lords. According to the police, the drug trade is flourishing because of the potential for huge profits in a country where the annual per capita income is only about $ 600. Marijuana can be bought in remote mountain plantations for 200 pesos -LRB- $ 9 -RRB- a kilo -LRB- 2.2 pounds -RRB- and sold in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for 10 times as much. <PERSON> Shabu </PERSON>, the crystaline drug, can be purchased in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for about $ 2,270 a kilo and sold in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for the equivalent of $ 45,450. Sources say some shabu also is being made locally. Corruption among police and customs officials is said to compound the enforcement problem. Col. <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, chief of the national police <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said his unit is riddled with corruption because poorly paid policemen find it difficult to turn down bribes from drug syndicates. He said at least 40 of his officers and men had been removed in an attempt to combat corruption. <PERSON> David </PERSON> and others say stronger laws and greater police powers are needed in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, if you go there and the police doubt your papers, they can just detain you,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said. `` That is the same case in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. They have stronger laws that empower the police to arrest anybody based only on strong suspicion that they are a violators of the law. We must have the same kind of laws here.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said the military has urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revive the death penalty for drug dealers. The Constitution, ratified in 1987, abolished capital punishment but allows <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revive it for `` heinous'' crimes. He also said the government should establish special courts to handle only drug offenses to speed up trials, which often drag on here for years. Because of legal obstacles in enforcing the laws, critics say, police often simply execute big-time dealers and then report that they were killed in a `` shootout.'' In the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area alone, at least 22 drug pushers have been killed in `` shootouts'' with police since <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> made his charges about the police and military in October. Sen. <PERSON> Neptali </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a former justice secretary, said the killings should persuade drug dealers to turn themselves in and seek government protection. `` Otherwise, they may soon find themselves targets of elimination,'' he said.

<HEAD>Western Companies Looking Cautiously Toward Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies do n't want to miss out on opportunities in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but they are moving with caution, as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> signaled this past week with its investment in a Hungarian light bulb maker. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150 million purchase of a 50 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Tungsram </ORGANIZATION> was labeled as one of the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments to date in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but in fact it was not especially large. The sum was dwarfed by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement on Friday of plans to spend $ 10 billion over the next five years on repurchasing its own stock. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> described the Hungarian investment as a `` prudent risk'' _ not a head-over-heels plunge. There are good reasons for caution. Communist political systems appear to be crumbling, but the bloody suppression of protest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this past June is a reminder that an authoritarian reaction remains possible. Also, the currencies of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, are non-convertible, meaning it is difficult for Western companies to take profits home from their joint ventures. The positive side is that Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is not only a huge potential market for consumer and capital goods, but a source of inexpensive, relatively well-educated workers _ a point recognized by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>. GE has bigger plans than selling light bulbs to Hungarians. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> told analysts and reporters Friday that the company hopes to export lighting systems from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a market it has so far been unable to crack because of the domination of <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. GE recognized that too much caution is dangerous, too, because there is a limited number of healthy potential business partners in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` To some extent the choice spots will be taken by those who are there first,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettibone </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Lord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Day </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Lord, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Western European companies have a built-in advantage over Americans when it comes to selling to and investing in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because of the geographic and cultural closeness. Less obviously, the Western Europeans have a banking advantage. The biggest American banks were burned by foolish lending to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and are neither willing nor able to make a big plunge into Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. West German banks, in contrast, are rich and willing, notes <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wich </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> marketing director for the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The German banks are more likely to lend to companies from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> than to, say, an <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> produces car engines in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> produces cars in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for export to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but so far the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s embrace of the so-called Iron Curtain nations has been less than wholehearted The ferment in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has overshadowed the opportunities in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but developments also continued there this past week. The <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this past week, bringing together <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Katushev </PERSON>, to discuss lowering barriers to trade and investment. In spite of all the talk, investments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> remain modest. The typical investment in U.S.-Soviet joint ventures is $ 3 million, according to a survey earlier this year by Lord Day & amp; Lord, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. When <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boveri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> bought <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> this past week for $ 1.6 billion, a company executive said it was `` charging full speed ahead'' into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc In fact, <ORGANIZATION> ABB </ORGANIZATION> gets less than 1 percent of its revenue in the Eastern bloc and President <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnevik </PERSON> told reporters he is hoping to raise that to perhaps 3 percent to 3.5 percent. Yes, businesses are moving into Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But with caution. In other business and economic news this past week: _ Government reports indicated economic sluggishness Reports said factory utilization slumped to the lowest level in 1 -LCB- years and retail sales sank by the biggest amount in 2 -LCB- years as auto sales tumbled. A big drop in the trade deficit mainly was the result of slowing imports, although exports rose. _ <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced an expensive overhaul of its credit-services operation after being embarrassed by widespread customer complaints It said the reforms would cut next year's profits about a tenth Analysts had been predicting an earnings gain in 1990. _ <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> announced it would buy up to 260 jets from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a transaction that could be worth more than $ 10 billion <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> unit would buy $ 4.5 billion worth of jetliners from <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, the European consortium.

 From the Thanksgiving feast to New Year's Day football, stuffing oneself as plump as the turkey seems almost obligatory. And while a certain smugness may be the reward for not indulging, few will find that sufficient sustenance at the holiday table. There are ways to enjoy the fat of the land without making the New Year's diet any tougher. `` Holidays should be subtitled ` national days of carbohydrates and fat,''' <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> writes in `` The Gourmet Gazelle Cookbook'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bantam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>, $ 19.95 -RRB-. `` A few years ago I was horrified to realize I had used more than four pounds of butter in cooking Thanksgiving dinner for eight people.'' It's estimated that Thanksgiving gobbling can total 3,000 calories _ two normal days' worth of food for many women. But Thanksgiving in particular, with its celebration of abundance and variety, provides a chance to serve and eat healthy foods without feeling left out. A key is flavorful, tradition-minded dishes without large amounts of fats, cholesterol or salt. The centerpiece of most feasts, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, is a good place to start. `` You should take off the skin for your portion if you're trying to lose weight,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>, author of `` Microwave Gourmet Healthstyle Cookbook'' -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> and Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 22.95 -RRB- `` The skin, unfortunately and sadly, is going to contain a major portion of the fat and the cholesterol in the bird.'' The roast turkey recipe in the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol Cookbook'' -LRB- Times Books, $ 18.95 -RRB- calls for stuffing the bird with parsley sprigs, apples and crushed peppercorns A separate recipe for cornbread dressing uses egg whites, vegetable spray and just one tablespoon of margarine. <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> also suggests paying close attention to side dishes and considering skipping such traditional items as creamed onions, buttery mashed potatoes and sugary canned cranberry sauce. `` I think people want some connection'' to the traditions, even if they are willing to make some changes, she said. For dessert she plans to make a pumpkin pudding, which is lighter than pie but `` satisfies most people in the sense of color, sweetness.'' `` We're not trying to set out to deprive people. If people walk around feeling constantly deprived, they are not going to stick with a diet. It's very important not to set up an antithesis between healthy food and pleasure.'' <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> will serve a fairly traditional Thanksgiving: vegetable soup, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> with a simple bread-and-sage stuffing, baked sweet potatoes, braised leeks, raw cranberry sauce -LRB- with some of the canned version for the children -RRB-, apple pie and pumpkin pudding. For a giblet gravy that's lighter than normal, she suggests cooking the <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> neck, wing tips and giblets -LRB- except the liver -RRB- in a container of water in the microwave. Then, rather than the fatty pan drippings, use the broth as the gravy base. To help make the meal a feast: _ Choose the freshest foods possible _ Eat slowly and savor the flavors, and less food will be enough _ Decide in advance which `` indulgence foods'' are important and which can be passed Stick to those decisions. But in the end, if the stuffing, or the creamed onions or the candied sweet potatoes are what makes you happy, go ahead. `` It's better to eat regular food, if that's going to make you happy, but then try not to clean your plate,'' <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> said. `` It's not going to kill you to have something festive that has butter one day a year.

<HEAD>Time Running Short For Year-End Tax Maneuvers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The waning weeks of the year provide stock-market investors with a rare opportunity to look favorably on their mistakes. Those shares you bought for $ 50 that now sell for $ 32 are n't just a painful lesson in the risks of playing the market _ they're a potential tax That may not be consolation enough to soothe your regrets over the loss of some hard-earned capital. But it may be sufficient reason to warrant taking some action before 1989 ends. If you transform a theoretical `` paper'' loss into an actual one by selling the offending securities, the loss you realize -LRB- including brokerage commissions you paid at both purchase and sale -RRB- can be deducted without limit from any capital gains you had during the year. People with more losses than gains, or no gains at all, can deduct losses against their other income up to a maximum of $ 3,000 a year. Losses beyond that are carried forward to future years. Financial advisers urge anyone who is a candidate for year-end maneuvers along these lines not to delay much longer. Depressed investments which are most likely choices for tax selling often get further depressed in December when that tax selling reaches its peak, they point out. In addition, they say, it may take a little time and planning to decide what you want to do with the money you receive from the sale. The rules do n't permit selling a security to realize a loss and simultaneously buying it back. In fact, if the offsetting purchase occurs any time within 30 days beforehand or afterward, it is considered a `` wash sale'' and the loss ca n't be deducted. A common way to skirt this obstacle is to switch into some similar security _ say, a stock of another company in a comparable business with about the same business prospects. Switching is especially suited to bond investments, where you can shop for a security of a different issuer with a yield, maturity and credit rating much the same as the one you sold. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reporter </ORGANIZATION>, advises would-be bond swappers, `` do n't delay making a decision until December. It takes time to find comparable bonds.'' With stocks, switching is more problematic, since the performances of individual companies' stock prices can be drastically affected by a long list of variables. Furthermore, you still may consider the future bright for a stock you own that has been a disappointment to date. If you want to take a deductible loss while sticking with that stock, you have two primary choices _ sell it now and buy it back 31 days later, or buy another chunk now and sell the original holding after 31 days have passed. The alternative of buying another chunk now protects you against the risk that the stock might suddenly soar while you have temporarily stepped aside. But it demands prompt action for any losses you want to take in 1989. Any good broker should be ready and eager to help you through the process of taking judicious tax losses _ as well as suggesting strategies for postponing capital gains into 1990. After all, year-end tax transactions are a time-tested source of commission revenue for the broker and his or her firm. That's a point worth bearing in mind for the customer as well as the broker. The research devoted to any year-end tax planning should include an appraisal of whether the tax savings achieved are worth the transaction costs.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Gleaming Brighter For Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Investors spooked by the stock market have taken to precious metals, a fact reflected by the sparkling performance of the gold, silver and platinum markets in the past week. The rise in prices also has caught the attention of jewelry makers and other commercial consumers of precious metals, whose higher-volume buying underscores the consensus among analysts that prices are unlikely to lapse to the relatively low levels that have prevailed for much of this year. The price of gold, traditionally the bellwether of the precious metals complex, has jumped nearly 8 percent in the five weeks since the stock market's 190-point plunge on Oct. 13. Gold for December delivery on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 395.80 a troy ounce Friday compared to $ 388.60 a week earlier. December silver soared to $ 5.685 an ounce from $ 5.26 during a week of heavy trading on the Commodity Exchange while platinum for January delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose to $ 526.60 an ounce from $ 509.60. Analysts closely are watching the gold market as an indicator of the rally's underlying strength. A move above $ 400 an ounce, a key psychological barrier last crossed in late January, likely would bring new buyers into the market and push prices sharply higher. `` I suspect we'll see gold test the $ 400 level before the year's end,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, senior metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Other analysts said the gold market seemed poised for a test of $ 400 an ounce as early as next week. Precious metals, especially gold, traditionally are perceived as a safe haven for investors during periods of rapid inflation or economic uncertainty, when it is considered more likely to hold its value than paper currencies or stocks. Analysts say the stock market's volatility has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors nervous enough to move some of their dollars into precious metals. Meanwhile, the far-reaching political and social changes occurring in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have stirred fears of economic trouble among European investors and driven them to the gold and silver markets as well. `` You're seeing a lot of retail buying from investors who have stood on the sidelines for two years,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Kaplan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Los Angeles-based metals and coins dealer. `` The money seems to be coming out of the stock and bond markets.'' Experts also have noted heavy buying of precious metals by Japanese interests in the past week, perhaps reflecting investor uneasiness in the Far East or stockpiling by Japanese jewelers. `` You can never underestimate the potential demand from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for both platinum and gold,'' <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON> said. Platinum is the most popular jewelry metal in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Platinum got an additional boost from the mid-week release of revised 1989 supply and demand projections by London-based <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matthey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest platinum refiner. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthey </PERSON> predicted world platinum consumption would outstrip production by 120,000 ounces this year, which would make 1989 the fifth straight year of deficit production and falling warehouse stocks. The silver market showed remarkable strength Wednesday through Friday. Analysts said the market was playing catch-up with gold and platinum after lagging behind those markets.

 The grain and soybean markets exhibited slight but steady strength through most of the week. The gains were largely seasonal, reflecting the end of the corn and soybean harvest and a shift in the market's attention from supply to demand concerns.

 Oil prices were little changed on the week.

 Prices were little changed, although prospects for more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> continued supporting the pork markets. A monthly <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released after the close of trading Friday showed three percent fewer cattle on feedlots Nov. 1 than on the same date a year ago. Although that number was near market expectations, the report also showed an unexpectedly large number of feedlot placements last month. That was expected to prompt fairly heavy selling of live cattle futures when trading resumes Monday.

<HEAD>Wall Street's Eyes on Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As political barriers have toppled between Communist and capitalist parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in recent days, Wall Street analysts have been watching with a particular sense of urgency. They see a rare opportunity to spot turning points that might well shape economic and financial trends worldwide for years to come. Preoccupied as they may often seem with fleeting matters _ the next swing in interest rates, or a 15-cent reduction in some company's earnings estimate for the next fiscal quarter _ most stock-market professionals are perpetually searching for news with a longer shelf-life. These prizes do n't turn up very often. Like the weather, financial trends are even more resistant to long-term analysis than they are to short-term forecasting. So the developments in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and elsewhere along the front lines of the Cold War have struck many Wall Streeters as the equivalent of a new gold mine, full of risks as well as rewards. `` If the Eastern bloc continues to liberalize, the world is going to look very different in a few years,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` As a result, financial markets will undergo major changes _ some bullish, some not so bullish.'' At this early stage, analysts readily acknowledge, the puzzle they have to work with is a vast one, with many pieces that are hard to fit together. They also caution that a seeming triumph for capitalism can be suddenly reversed, as happened earlier this year at in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. `` At some stage Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will pass a point of no return on the path to democracy, and it will be impossible for the Soviets to turn back the clock,'' observed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The trick will be to get to that point quickly, before the door is shut _ but not so quickly that evolution devolves into revolution and invites reaction.'' That kind of qualified optimism seemed to fit the mood of investors in general during the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 27.05 to 2,652.66. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index climbed 1.38 to 189.28; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 0.93 to 456.72, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 1.88 at 373.35. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume averaged 147.69 million shares a day, against 148.76 million the week before. If capitalism is about to flower in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, most analysts see a vast range of possible implications for the world's financial markets Said Sherman: `` Trade flows between the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and East could accelerate sharply, bank credits to Eastern bloc countries could explode, defense budgets would come under enormous downward pressure.'' Adds <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, `` The very obvious eager demand for American identifiable brand names such as <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Nike </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> and McDonald's means that a huge market exists that might well be able to afford these products within the intermediate future, assuming that no political disruptions occur along the way.'' Furthermore, noted <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, `` A lot of machinery will be needed _ both traditional and technological capital goods.'' Amid all the optimism, however, analysts caution that securities markets are subject to wide and unpredictable changes of heart as they adjust to something as complicated as the situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Trying to draw some economic conclusions about these developments is guesswork at the very best,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` I suggest that when the joy and excitement subside, something like a hangover could be ahead. `` There's a lot of risk associated with moving from a very centralized controlled political system to one with more individual participation.''
