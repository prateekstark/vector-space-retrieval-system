<DATELINE>SALVADOR, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 International celebrities, including music star <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, have joined in a campaign to save the world's largest example of Portuguese colonial architecture in downtown <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, one of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s oldest cities. The 91-acre district is now a slum. It is called <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> word for `` pillory,'' stemming from <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s former slave trade. <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION>'s largely abandoned facades line the narrow streets of the city that also was <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first capital and sometimes is known to outsiders as <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>, the name of the coastal city's state. In addition to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, other international celebrities involved in the campaign include the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> crooner <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Akio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morito </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Of the district's 978 buildings, some dating as far back as the 1500s, 300 are close to collapse, 48 are in ruins, and about 10 slide down hillsides every year in seasonal rainstorms, according to <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, coordinator of the save-Pelourinho campaign <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION>'s spacious mansions housed the elite when <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> was, until 1763, the capital of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s vast South American Colony. Today it is a Skid Row, home to prostitutes, drug dealers and muggers. `` <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION> must be the world's largest Baroque slum,'' said the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> state secretary for culture, <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, who also is a popular singer and composer. `` There are people in this city who have n't dared venture into <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION> for the past 20 years.'' But for the first time authorities, encouraged by private business, have launched a massive campaign to clean up the winding streets and half-collapsed mansions, which in 1987 were designated by <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> as part of mankind's `` cultural heritage.'' The buildings are protected from demolition by a local decree. `` If we do n't do something now, the whole beautiful area will be completely irrecoverable in 10 years,'' said Ms. <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, an engineer. But conversely, it was after the <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> designation that the colonial buildings, arcades, courtyards and cobblestone streets began fell into greater disarray. `` Landlords refused to invest in their properties, which were inhabited by tenants who could pay almost no rent,'' <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> said. `` And they were n't allowed to tear down their buildings. So the strategy was to let the buildings literally fall down _ with tenants inside them.'' So far, the so-called Historical Park of <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION>, operating with 150 functionaries borrowed from various municipal government offices, has raised the equivalent of about $ 7 million in government grants and loans, Ms. <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said. But organizers hope a media campaign that began in February directed at foreign and domestic business communities will bring in much more. <PERSON> Morita </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON> are featured in 60-second public service announcements asking for donations and encouraging businesses to invest in the area. `` We need Brazilians and others to feel responsible for the area, to understand that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was born here and want to leave this for their children,'' Ms. <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said. `` Most of the people who actually live here exist in subhuman conditions and could care less about <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION>.'' Black groups have been some of the most active in rallying to save the decaying center, as part of a slow but growing black-consciousness movement in mixed-race <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION> was a major port of entry for slaves from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> from the 1500s through 1888, when slavery was abolished in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. One of the area's most beautiful buildings, the Rosary of the <ORGANIZATION> Blacks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was built over a period of 150 years by and for slaves. `` Every stone here was laid with the sweat of blacks,'' said an area resident known only as `` Zoinho.'' `` We have to save this area. It's a monument to our suffering.'' Paulo de <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, 18, lives with his father and four brothers and sisters in two rooms of a massively subdivided old home. He was born in <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION>. `` I would n't leave this place,'' he said. `` This is my home. But if you knocked down our old home and built an apartment building in it's place, we'd be much happier.'' Some residents are worried that increased property values will drive out long-time inhabitants. `` We have to make sure we do n't turn <LOCATION> Pelourinho </LOCATION> into a picture postcard,'' Ms. <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> said. `` The sense of community here is rich and very strong. We need to bring in jobs, schools, health facilities and give people the chance to appreciate the fabulous historicl setting.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent a letter to President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> regarding <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s refusal to extradite a Puerto Rican separatist accused of being a terrorist, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON> delivered the letter to de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> Friday afternoon, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said. He said he did not have any details of the message concerning 37-year-old <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, who was freed from a Mexican prison June 24 and allowed to leave on a flight to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. A spokesman at de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s office said the president would respond to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s letter `` as soon as possible.'' He did not comment on the contents of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> message but said de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> told Pilliod he has instructed the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to respond to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> protest delivered earlier this week to the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON> had personally carried the letter to de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> but she also would not discuss the contents. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said there had been no change in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's outrage at the release of <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> has called <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> a `` convicted terrorist and murderer.'' <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Thursday night from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> where he had been recalled for consultations Tuesday. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> did not advise the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that it had released <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> until Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said. Mexican officials frequently characterized <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> as a `` political fighter,'' not a criminal, and local news reports usually did not mention <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> conviction in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for murder. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> was released after serving five years of an eight-year sentence for the 1983 slaying of a Mexican police officer and for entering the country illegally. At the time of that killing, <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> was an escaped convict from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, having fled in 1979 from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison after being convicted of weapons and explosives charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. After his capture in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pressed without success for his extradition.

<DATELINE>BENNINGTON, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials could relax state restrictions on pesticide spraying in an effort to control the pear thrips, an insect blamed for defoliating thousands of acres of maple trees in southern <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. Officials of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forests </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION>, along with experts from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> and entomologists experienced with thrips from other northeastern states, have come up with a research project designed to learn more about the insect's habits, life cycle and impact on maple crops and products. Pear thrips are insects whose feeding habits have damaged and weakened thousands of acres of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> sugarbush, particularly in <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION> counties. The plans that experts have laid to improve the lot of maple trees may involve asking Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> to relax her 1986 policy strictly limiting pesticide spraying by state agriculture and transportation officials. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Paine </PERSON>, deputy commissioner of agriculture, has done a control pesticide test spray on a sugarbush in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> with state permission to discover the most effective stage to spray in the thrips' life cycle. State forester <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said recently the committee also wants to check for trends using an earth-orbiting satellite that takes color coded infrared snapshots of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> forest land. The photos, which would cost between $ 10,000 and $ 12,000, could give foresters a better idea of what next year's maple crop will look like since the camera picks up signs of weakness and disease that human eyes can miss. Project members also plan to send out questionnaires to all known <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> sugarmakers, asking them to comment on the extent of thrips damage.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recall the white lies they told each other on their first date, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>, remembers her surprise when a friend told her she found the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president sexy. These are a few of the tidbits of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lore that British television viewers will see on July 8, when the first of a three-part series on the life of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is broadcast. The film, shown to journalists Thursday, is filled with varied assessments of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. To Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, the president is `` a revolutionary and he's changed the agenda -LRB- in -RRB- the most sweeping presidency in this country probably since <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>.'' Former budget director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies `` the singular greatest episode of sustained economic mismanagement in the 20th-century history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says of her husband: `` I think he made people feel good about themselves, good about the country. We now have a strong economy, unemployment is down, interest rates are down. ...'' The film traces <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to his Midwestern boyhood, interviewing friends and schoolmates. Actress Olivia de Havilland recalls <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the late actor <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> lining up as soldiers so that <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>'s shoulder obscured <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. She says <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quietly kicked the sand into a mound, `` higher and higher, and finally, when the photographer said, ` All right everybody, let's smile,' the future president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stepped up on the mound and towered over <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>.'' Interviewer <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> why he spied for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> on colleagues in the Screen Actors Guild of which he was president. `` They -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- came wanting some advice, some findings on people that I had dealt with, and I got an insight into what was happening to the motion picture business. It did give me a real understanding of the communist menace,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recalls their first date when, mutually wary, they both said they had `` early morning calls'' so that they could leave early if they did n't like each other. They got home at 2:30 a.m, she says. `` I think by that time both of us knew that neither one us of had an early morning call.'' <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s daughter by his first marriage to actress <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>, says a friend who saw <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> doing a TV ad dressed as a cowboy exclaimed to her that `` he's so sexy.'' `` I said, my father sexy? You must be kidding. ` No no, he's wonderful. And he is wonderful,'' Miss <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says. During his 50-minute interview, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> describes his wife as `` a helpmeet such as I think every man dreams of having, a relationship that sort of matches your dreams of marriage when you were an adolescent.'' He laughs about claims that she interferes in policy-making. `` She does n't go down and get involved in affairs like disarmament or anything else. She advises me of what she thinks is good for me, and I feel free to confide in her the things that are going on. `` As a matter of fact she's a help just by my knowing that she's up there when I go to meet her at the end of the day.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Will Take Another Look at Death Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The constitutionality of the death penalty for juvenile killers again will be on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s agenda next term, a welcome surprise for capital punishment foes. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingerson </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Abolish the Death Penalty, said, `` It's very encouraging. I assumed it would be another couple of years before they took the issue up in another case.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzschild </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said the court's willingness to restudy the issue `` is very startling.'' But he cautioned against reading too much into the court's announcement `` It's foolish to try and predict what the court will do,'' he said. The justices on Thursday provided a dramatic epilogue to their 1987-88 term by agreeing to consider banning capital punishment for all juvenile murderers when the court returns for the next term on the first Monday in October. Just 24 hours earlier, the court had come close to banning the death penalty for those who commit murders before they are 16. Few expected it would move so quickly to re-examine capital punishment for juvenile killers. But the justices said Thursday they will use cases from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to reconsider the fate of young killers. The court said it will decide sometime in 1989 whether use of the death penalty for anyone under 18 when the crime was committed violates the Constitution's ban on `` cruel and unusual punishment.'' The court will consider overturning the death sentences of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> death row inmate <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON>, who was 17 when he participated in a 1976 murder, and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> death row inmate <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON>, who was 16 when he committed a 1985 murder. High was just weeks shy of his 18th birthday when he took part in a gas station robbery in <LOCATION> Taliferro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, in which an 11-year-old boy was shot to death. <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> helped rob an <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, liquor store. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a store clerk, was fatally stabbed. The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty said 30 death row inmates nationwide _ out of a total of 2,100 _ were under 18 when they committed their crimes. Of the 100 men and women executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated capital punishment in 1976, three committed their crimes when they were 17. Since 1948, no one has been executed for a crime committed when he or she was younger than 17. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> bans the death penalty for those under 18, it would affect most of the 37 states with death penalty laws _ including those that do not specify a minimum age for killers subject to capital punishment and states that specify age limits under 18. On Wednesday, four justices said the death penalty is unconstitutional for those who were younger than 16 when they committed murder. Three justices said the Constitution does not set such age limits for executions. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> provided a fifth vote to throw out the death penalty for a convicted <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> killer who was 15 when he helped kill his former brother-in-law. But <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> stopped just short of calling for abolition of capital punishment for killers under 16. A key vote in next term's cases will be provided by Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who joined the court in February, too late to participate in the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> case. In other action Thursday, the court: _ Agreed to study alleged race discrimination in Alaskan salmon canneries, setting the stage for an important sequel to the court's ruling on Wednesday that makes it easier for workers to prove their bosses are guilty of illegal _ Cleared away the last legal obstacle to a $ 180 million settlement _ with interest now worth some $ 240 million _ between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans and manufacturers of the herbicide Agent Orange The court let stand rulings dismissing lawsuits by about 300 veterans who challenged the settlement, in which as many as 250,000 others could participate. _ Agreed to decide whether states may ban virtually all lawyer advertisements that feature testimonials or client endorsements The justices will review a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rule that presumes such ads are false or misleading.

<TEXT>
 Even in the jet age, a 55-hour trip is a pretty brisk pace for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State. How does <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> do it? Also: Why? He does it by relying on what appear to be enormous reserves of energy. But why did he decide to sweep through <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in his first trip to the region since 1986? Some senior members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are puzzled. Is <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> trying to lay the groundwork for a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drive to win support for the Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras? And why did he ignore appeals from the Nicaraguan leader, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, that he stop in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>? A senior official who briefed reporters before <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s departure Wednesday said renewed aid for the Contras would not be a major focus of the trip, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> apparently shunned <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy calls for avoiding <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> leaders until they display what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration regards as serious interest in moving toward a democratic system From <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s perspective, that would be a lot easier to do if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stopped trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. Sandinista leaders have been appealing to the Contras to resume peace talks, but the Contras say the Nicaraguan government would have to take certain steps first. These include granting permission to open a television station not run by the government, allow the taking of public opinion polls, declaring a general amnesty and suspending military recruitment. And so, round and round they go, with the prospect of renewed fighting always there. Peace talks ended June 9. The cease-fire has lasted three months, but the thousands of Contra soldiers who took sanctuary in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> during the lull may be ready to fight again. They are rested and have received food, clothing and medicine from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> hopes the leaders of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> will pressure <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to take a more flexible position on peace talks with the Contras. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels ended Feb. 29, and the mood on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> is strongly against a resumption. Ostensibly, the administration is trying to decide what to do. Conservatives on its right flank do not want to see the Contras foresaken. Critics have insisted from the start that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s objective is to overthrow the Sandinista government one way or another <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s harsh rhetoric over the past six years has lent support to this theory. `` The Sandinistas seek to build totalitarian society on the back of a massive military machine,'' he said Thursday in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The softened tone <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have taken lately toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is not duplicated in this hemisphere. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> remain anathema to them, and a test of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resolve in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The military takeover in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> was a setback to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hopes. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has stopped ticking off proudly the number of countries in the hemisphere deemed to have turned democratic since <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> entered the White House 7 -LCB- years ago. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> made the point in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> on Thursday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s per-person income is the lowest in the region while the picture is brighter elsewhere. `` <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is out of step, a country isolated by its rejection of freedom, growth and the security of its neighbors,'' he said. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is firmly in charge in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> may be in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But there is an armed resistance in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> have not lost hope the rebels will force a change in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> before the administration shuts down in January.

<HEAD>Traditional Pork Barrel Bill Comes Up Lean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first fiscal 1989 appropriations bill, a bare-bones energy and water development package, is a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote away from heading to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk. The $ 17.83 billion package worked out by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators cleared the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 384-17 roll call Thursday and is expected to win easy <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval next week following the July Fourth recess. The spending bill, the product of a tight-money year, is more noteworthy for what it lacks than what it contains. There is no money to begin construction of the superconducting super collider and, lawmakers say, not a dime to start work on new <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> water projects. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and staffers say they ca n't recall when even huge budget deficits prevented at least a few new dams or harbor projects from being tossed into the traditional pork barrel bill. The administration is not happy about the lack of construction money for the <ORGANIZATION> SSC </ORGANIZATION>, the multi-billion dollar high-energy physics project that backers say is needed to keep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> technologically competitive. The White House, however, has not made any veto threats against the energy and water bill as it has against a number of the other 12 spending bills under consideration in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders on both sides the Capitol agreed to give the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> $ 100 million next year to continue preliminary work on the SSC, but they said a decision to build it should be made by the next president. The bill contains money to continue construction work on more than 200 corps and bureau water projects. Although the administration sought six new corps starts, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations committees approved none, taking the position that just one new start would set off a clamor among lawmakers for more. More than two-thirds of the money in the bill _ $ 13.16 billion _ is headed for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, with that agency's nuclear activities for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accounting for $ 8.1 billion. The non-defense portion of the department's budget would finance a variety of activities, including research into solar and other renewable forms of energy and environmental restoration and safety programs. At the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s insistance, the bill contains $ 3 million to study the `` greenhouse effect,'' the global warming trend that scientists say threatens the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> with climate changes and rising ocean waters. The corps would have $ 11 million less next year than in fiscal 1988 to spend on dams, harbors and other work, including a growing number of shoreline erosion projects. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION>, which operates irrigation and power facilities in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, would get $ 40 million more in fiscal 1989, with more than 40 percent of the money going to three large projects: <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Challenger Widow Fears for Next Shuttle Crew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The widow of space shuttle Challenger pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who sued the makers of shuttle rockets blamed for the Challenger explosion, says she will be praying for the safety of the next shuttle crew. Shuttle Discovery _ which has undergone 210 modifications and seven months of delay _ will be the first shuttle flight since Challenger exploded in January 1986 killing all seven aboard. The launch is scheduled for Sept. 4. `` I'll be saying my prayers for the crew and their families,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> after giving a tearful deposition on Wednesday to lawyers for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government contractor <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>. `` I hope they'll be safe.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and her three children are the only relatives of the Challegner crew who have n't settled a lawsuit with the government or Thiokol. Last May, the 42-year-old widow filed a $ 1.5 billion wrongful death suit against <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, the government and the director of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s solid rocket booster program. Since then, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> federal judge has denied two of her three claims _ that <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> be banned from supplying booster rockets for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> shuttles and that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> be named as a defendant in the lawsuit. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s remaining claim _ which will be heard in a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> federal court Sept. 12 _ is aimed at <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to recommend the ill-fated launch. A leaking seal on one of the booster rockets was blamed for the Challenger explosion.

<TEXT>
 Three former government officials and a Nicaraguan businessman have been sentenced for passing economic secrets to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, news reports said. The pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Thursday that <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldana </PERSON> <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON>, a former planning official, and <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, were sentenced Wednesday to 16 years for passing secret economic documents to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials. They were arrested in late May and were accused of `` taking documents with the classification ` secret,''' the paper said. <PERSON> Alegria </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, director of the council's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, also was charged with organizing `` a network of informants in some Nicaraguan state institutions,'' it added. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> official, and <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinales </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, each drew a three-year term for providing the information to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> which then passed it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave contrasting pictures of the economy as Republicans continued work on a party platform that they said would have more meat than the Democratic document. The disagreements over how well off Americans really are occurred as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> prepared to visit a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union hall in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to his vacation home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, for a celebration of his mother's 87th birthday today. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was returning tonight to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, planned to celebrate the Fourth of July with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has pressed for an offer of the No. 2 position on the Democratic ticket, will meet Monday night with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign press secretary. The aide gave no indication what the two might discuss. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor faced continued heat from opponents in the Statehouse who criticized him for campaigning while the state ended its fiscal year with a nearly $ 400 million deficit Thursday and without a budget for the next year. A series of tax bills and fee-raising measures to help the state pay for expanded spending in fiscal 1989 was nearing enactment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a luncheon group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that paid $ 10,000 a couple to hear him speak that the country has been enjoying an economic recovery since late 1982, the longest peacetime expansion in history. He said that two years ago economists predicted a downturn that has n't arrived. `` Wrong, wrong, wrong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` No wonder it's called the ` dismal science.''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Liberals promise compassion but they deliver misery.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told employees at a <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aluminum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that the average weekly wage for jobs lost between 1979 and 1985 was $ 440, while the average weekly pay for new jobs during that period was only $ 270. `` Too many of our families are struggling to hold on, challenged by change, anxious about their jobs, burdened by the rising costs of health care and housing and college tuition, troubled by the lack of quality affordable child care,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Republicans meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to draft a party platform criticized the Democrats' platform document as lacking content and trying to conceal a tax and spend policy. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said the Democrats kept their platform short because `` they do n't have much to talk about. ... I mean, who wants to talk about raising your taxes and more regulation and more spending?'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, asked if he wanted the No. 2 job, said: `` I do n't think it's a question of wanting it. ... It's a question of winning the election, helping your party and trying to help your country. I'd want to be majority leader if I had my choice. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> told reporters at the meeting he does not expect to be picked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a running mate, but said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> might be. `` I'm not after it because I do n't think it's going to be offered,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, adding that from `` all of the signals, all of the press reports coming out of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, it sounds to me like they're leaning to <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won the backing Thursday of the political action committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest teacher union The 1.9-million member union's board is scheduled to meet today and almost certainly concur with the PAC's choice <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the endorsement applies only to the Democratic nomination. The union wo n't make a final presidential endorsement until Sept. 8, after both parties have held their conventions. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> refused to comment on whether he would use the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visit to disclose whether he wants to pursue the second spot on the ticket. `` At this point, I will simply pursue the process and convey my private conclusions to Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'' later, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> played a game of role reversal Thursday in response to a pair of polls that showed the two candidates tied or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trailing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> only slightly. Earlier polls have given <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> double-digit leads. `` I can only say what I've been saying for 16 months,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Early polls are meaningless.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, declared `` I'm feeling like <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>,'' and depicted himself as a comeback winner.

<HEAD>More Than 1 Million Children Official Non-Entities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than one million children in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> officially do not exist because they were born outside state birth control targets, rendering them unable to receive food rations, schooling and job assignments, an official report said. The children, most of whom are under age 10, are commonly referred to as `` black children.'' They are children whose parents did not have their births registered or who were refused registration by local authorities, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Under <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s one-child policy, officials in each county are responsible for ensuring that each woman has only one child and that the number of births in the county does not exceed the birth target set by the state. Parents are penalized for having more than one child, and officials are penalized if the county goes over the number of births that it is allowed. Officials, however, are financially rewarded if births stay within the target. Some parents did not register births of their second or subsequent children to avoid paying the fine, the paper said. Fines vary from region to region, but are generally $ 270 or more per year for five years, a huge fine by Chinese standards. Some local officials, seeing their bonuses jeapordized by too many births, simply refuse to register new babies, the paper said. In one city in southwestern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province, local officials refused to register the births of 450 babies because the birth target had already been reached, the report said. Without a residence permit, children are deprived of the rights of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizen. They do not receive their ration of rice and edible oil, are unable to register for school and will not be able to get a job, join the military or sit for college entrance exams when they grow up, the newspaper said. The problem will become even greater when these children marry and have children of their own, who also will be unable to get residence permits, it said. The situation is most serious in the provinces of <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jiangxi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guizhou </LOCATION>. In each of these provinces, `` black children'' number more than 70,000, the report said. State officials have called attention to the problem, saying that the children are innocent victims, the newspaper reported. They said the situation not only hurts the children, it also affects the nation's family planning and population control efforts and creates social problems. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s birth rate hit 2 percent in 1986 and stayed there last year. If the trend continues, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s population of 1.08 billion will double by the year 2030, according to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for Population Activities. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has said that it must keep the birth rate at 1.5 percent if it is to meet its goal of keeping the population under 1.2 billion by the year 2000. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will mark <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s Three Billion Population Day today. In a televised speech for the occasion Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said Thursday, `` The country has listed family planning as one of its basic national policies and taken the control of population growth as a strategic task.''

 Many Nicaraguans are critical of their leftist government and do n't believe it is democratic, but they think Soviet policies are better than those of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to a private poll. A survey presented Thursday as the first independent poll of Nicaraguan opinion under nine years of <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> rule indicates strong support for President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, 85 percent opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Contra aid, and 68 percent disapproval of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Asked what they most admire about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 42 percent of those polled said `` nothing,'' which was the most prevalent answer. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for the past seven years has supported rebels attempting to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. The poll of 1,129 adults in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and research groups in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON>, director of the cosponsoring <ORGANIZATION> Interamerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the newly formed, private <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> used accepted scientific polling methods, employing students at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which he described as the nation's most politically neutral university. The students interviewed 1,129 adults selected at random in five types of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> neighborhoods on June 4-5. <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> did not offer a margin of error for the poll but he said at a news conference that several steps were taken to ensure its integrity and objectivity. But he did note that many educated people who might have given anti-Sandinista views have fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with their homes taken over by government officials and military officers. He said about 27 percent of those polled worked for the government, and they were the most supportive of the Sandinistas. Thirty-eight percent of the respondents believed the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' management of the Nicaraguan economy has been either bad or terrible, while 36 percent described it as fair, and only 22 percent said it was good or excellent. Seventy-four percent of those interviewed said they rated their family's economic situation worse than a year ago, while only 7 percent said it was better. Forty-eight percent said they did not consider the Sandinista government democratic while 40 percent said they did. But there was general support for Sandinista peace efforts and the government's foreign policies A majority supported incorporation of the Contras into the country's political life but most of those interviewed also said they doubted the fighting would end soon. The overall results show the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic blockade of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contra rebels, has alienated even many anti-Sandinista Nicaraguans, <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> received higher positive responses than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> among all income levels on several questions, with higher-income groups being more pro-Soviet and pro-Sandinista than poorer and less-educated Nicaraguans. Future polls _ the research group plans one of people in several <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries later this year _ will attempt to obtain more detail about reaction to Soviet policies, said <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON>. Only 1 percent of the respondents described <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central American policy as excellent, 7 percent called it good, 17 percent said fair, 40 percent said bad and 28 percent called it terrible. Asked the same question about Soviet policy, 14 percent said it was excellent, 43 percent good, 14 percent fair, 9 percent bad and 4 percent terrible. In evaluating <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s management of the government over the last four years, 42 percent said it was good or excellent, 29 percent fair and 21 percent bad or terrible. <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> said this is a high rating in Latin American terms. He said in a similar poll conducted in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, only 13 percent of respondents gave President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> a good or excellent rating. The poll showed that 28 percent of those interviewed claimed affiliation with the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, 9 percent with liberal or conservative opposition parties and 59 percent said they belonged to no party. <PERSON> Bollinger </PERSON> said the Nicaraguan government did not interfere with the survey even though laws apparently are still on the books prohibiting independent polling in the country.

<HEAD>Iranian Silkworm Battery Could Pose New Threat, US Commander Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction of a permanent Silkworm battery by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> near the entrance to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and the feared addition of a more advanced anti-ship missile to the Iranian arsenal may heighten risks to passing tankers, says the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the region. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, the Marine four-star who heads the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Thursday that completion of the Iranian Silkworm battery at Kuhe-Stak and the possible addition of another Chinese anti-ship missile, the CA-08, could make passage in or out of the gulf more dangerous. But he said that since a daylong naval battle on April 18, in which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> lost two of its four frigates, Iranian forces have steered clear of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships and aircraft. `` They have been very careful not to engage us,'' said <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>. A crack team of electronics experts, sent from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the gulf, determined several weeks after the clash that, despite reports to the contrary, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had not fired a Silkworm missile at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces during the fray, he said. The false reports were generated by computers hooked up to radars aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships that mistook a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> SM-1 missile fired at an Iranian target for a Silkworm, he said. For about two years, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has had Silkworm missiles at the port of <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> near the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, with the ability to set them up at temporary sites to fire within a matter of hours, said <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>. But the permanent earth and concrete bunker, `` with a 57-mile range missile, will cover the entire <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. It will allow <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to have the missile ready to be fired within five minutes,'' he said. Work on the bunker, first reported in early 1987, was continuing, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said in his first briefing with reporters since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> allowed Kuwaiti tankers to fly the Stars and Stripes last summer and began escorting them through the gulf. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said he was pondering what weapons would be needed to destroy the bunker, but meanwhile was stationing the cruise USS Vincennes, equipped with advanced Aegis radar and air-defense missiles, in position to protect any merchant ship passing throught the straits. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said the cruiser would be ordered to fire against any <ORGANIZATION> Silkworm </ORGANIZATION> launched, regardless of its intended target. `` The threat is not to our ships'' which have been equipped with defenses against missiles like the Silkworm, `` but to unarmed merchant ships,'' said <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>. `` We are not at war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>. Therefore, before he orders the site bunker destroyed, `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will have to do something to violate international law,'' said the general. Stationing an Aegis cruiser at the Strait of Hormuz may make the decision to fire easier, because if a Silkworm is fired, `` I think it will be a little hard to tell who the target is,'' and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship will try to destroy the attacking missile, he said. And under the rules of engagement in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships and aircraft are under orders to respond agressively to a ship, plane or shore installation they believe is attacking them. `` If they fired a Silkworm at me, I would go get them,'' said <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said that despite repeated protests from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was continuing to sell advanced arms to the Iranians. He could not specify the exact arms, but said that a ship from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> unloaded weaponry from those countries about once every three months at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is believed to have about 20 Silkworms in the southern gulf, probably kept at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, and more such missiles in the northern gulf, and he fears that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has also sold <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> CA-08 missiles. The CA-08 has a more sophisticated guidance system than the Silkworm, which he described as `` primitive,'' but carries a 500-pound warhead compared to the 1,100-pound warhead on the Silkworm.

 Republican leaders are looking to construct a conservative platform that builds on the party's triumphs in 1980 and 1984, while carving out expanded new planks on such hot issues as drugs, AIDS, education and child care. Republican party chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and other top <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials pledged at a platform hearing here Thursday that they will offer <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters a clear picture of what policies a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will pursue _ in contrast to what they called the deliberate vagueness of the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis-inspired </PERSON> Democratic platform. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the platform chairman, told reporters: `` Every indication to me is that we will have much the same platform we had in 1984. ... We clearly have been successful with the American electorate with that platform.'' She added that it would reflect `` a conservative political philosophy.'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Wis., co-chairman of the platform committee, said the Republicans' 1984 vow not to raise taxes, at a time when <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was promising a tax increase, `` was the basis on which we won 49 states. <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> called the Democrats' 2,000-word draft platform approved in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> last Saturday `` a bland compromise'' designed to camouflage the true intentions of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his party. But as the election nears, <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> said, `` the disguise will come off and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will be exposed for the narrow-minded, liberal wolf in sheep's clothing that he really is.'' <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> told reporters that while the 1988 GOP platform draws heavily from the 1984 platform on taxes, the economy and defense, the Republicans must pay more attention this time to such issues as drugs, AIDS, education and child care. `` The debate and the discussion and the dissension will probably be on those new issues which we're going to rassle with in the platform committee,'' said <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>. Five members of what will ultimately be a 106-member <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform committee presided at the day-long hearing on the economy and jobs, along with <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> challenged the Democrats to `` meet us on the battlefield of ideas'' with a platform that spells out `` not only what we want to accomplish, but how we intend to get there.'' He said the party platforms take on even more importance this year, the first presidential election in two decades without an incumbent in the race. The GOP platform will actually be written in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> starting Aug. 8, the week before the convention. At Thursday's hearing, drugs were a main concern. The platform committee heard an assistant police chief of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, call for draconian measures against drugs and drug-related crime, including denial of business and professional licenses to those who test positive for drugs. `` We are approaching a civilization crisis _ a literal civilization crisis,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, who called for a World War II-like mobilization to fight drugs. `` It should be unpopular and costly to abuse drugs in any form.'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON> said later they felt taking away business licenses might be going too far. But the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> senator added that the toughest part of the drug issue `` for us to decide is the mandatory vs. voluntary parts.'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> said drug education must start in fourth grade, because it is too late once kids `` have had the taste of big money'' from drug dealing. He said drugs were draining hundreds of millions of dollars from the American economy, and he questioned why the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> keeps sending aid to countries where the drugs come from. `` It's like handing a firearm to somebody who is threatening to kill you,'' said Block. `` There's no country in the world today who, short of a nuclear attack, could mount the kind of offensive that would even come close to equalizing the level of death, destruction and human misery that is being generated by substance abuse in this country.'' A black businessman, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baszile </PERSON>, testified that drug dealers are entrepreneurs, too, and might turn to legal businessed if economic development funds were available in black communities. Two former rivals to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, said that to keep the White House, the Republicans must attract independent and cross-over Democratic voters. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told reporters flatly that he does not expect to be picked by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a running mate, and predicted <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would be. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, asked if he wanted the No. 2 job: `` I do n't think it's a question of wanting it. ... It's a question of winning the election, helping your party and trying to help your country. I'd want to be majority leader if I had my choice.

<HEAD>Electric Boat Employees Go On Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An estimated 10,200 Electric Boat employees went on strike at the company's shipyard here Friday after contract talks with the submarine builder broke down. `` We expect the strike to be strong and well-supported,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Electric Boat, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is one of only two shipyards making nuclear submarines for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and the only manufacturer of subs capable of carrying the giant Trident ballistic missile. Talks broke down at 11:20 p.m. Thursday after a three-hour last-ditch effort, and the walkout began after midnight. No new talks were planned. Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> awarded this year's third and final SSN-688 fast-attack submarine contract to Electric Boat. The $ 347.4 million contract will go to EB's main shipyard in here and its other plant, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION>, R.I. The strike does not affect the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant. In a letter to employees, shipyard General Manager <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> said a strike will not stop submarine construction at the shipyard here. EB arranged to assign 3,000 salaried employees to shipyard jobs in the event of a strike. The two sides stalemated over the union's demand for percentage wage increases and the shipyard's insistence that it could afford no more than cash bonuses to remain competitive in its pursuit of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts. Union members voted earlier Thursday 4,921 to 3,140 to reject the company's latest offer but returned to the bargaining table with 4 -LCB- hours to go before the strike deadline in a last-ditch effort to reach a settlement. Talks began in November to replace a three-year contract that expired Friday. The last strike at the shipyard was in 1975, when the union walked out for five months and the region's economy sagged. In <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, state Labor Commissioner <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tianti </PERSON> said she would meet on Friday with members of the state's congressional delegation and others to see what could be done to lessen the economic impact of the strike. The union wanted straight hourly wage increases of 5 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent over three years. Electric Boat's `` last, best and final offer,'' presented Monday, calls for bonuses totaling $ 4,250 over three years for a first-class mechanic making $ 12.02 an hour, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotir </PERSON>, vice president of human resources. The company cited increased competition from the only other submarine shipyard in the country, the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drydock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which pays its workers 60 cents an hour less than <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>, recently won two contracts for nuclear attack submarines after it underbid Electric Boat. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> wants to get into the cheapest subs around, why do n't they get Yugos?'' said <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamphere </PERSON>, 27, of <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON>, president of the foundry workers local. `` We do n't want to make a million bucks, we're not asking for the world. We just want to keep up.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Legal Testimony of Psychology Experts Often Wrong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Courts trying to determine if defendants will commit violent crimes in the future would do just as well to flip a coin as to listen to the `` expert'' testimony of psychiatrists and psychologists, a study published today indicates. The inaccuracy of judgments by trained clinicians raises `` substantial doubt that psychologists or psychiatrists meet legal standards for expertise,'' says the report published in the journal Science. The study was conducted by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>, an associate professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziskin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawyer and psychologist. They found that laymen without degrees or clinical experience often can make courtroom evaluations of violent defendants as accurately as psychologists and psychiatrists. And making decisions by just the flip of a coin, <PERSON> Faust </PERSON> said, often is more accurate than the judgments of the experts. Life or death decisions by juries may be influenced by psychological experts who are called to testify in criminal trials on the mental state of defendants, or their potential for violence. In many states, the punishment phase of capital murder trials takes into consideration a prediction of the continued violent behavior of the defendant. Prosecutors and defense lawyers frequently call on psychologists or psychiatrists for opinions. But <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>, in a telephone interview Thursday, said the accuracy of the these opinions is questionable. `` In many studies the error rate well exceeds the accuracy rate,'' <PERSON> Faust </PERSON> said. `` There is virtually no evidence that experts are any better equipped to make those judgments than are lay individuals.'' He said some studies have shown that experts are accurate in their predictions less than half the time. `` If you flip a coin, you ought to be right 50 percent of the time,'' said <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>. `` So there are studies showing accuracies of less than chance.'' Education, he said, often has little to do with predicting violent behavior. `` One study using high school students showed that their accuracy was similar to that of experts in predicting violent behavior,'' <PERSON> Faust </PERSON> said. In the Science article, <PERSON> Faust </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ziskin </PERSON> cited a series of studies that they said showed `` clinicians are wrong at least twice as often as they are correct'' in predicting violent behavior. They said one study followed 967 patients who had been placed in maximum security hospitals on the basis of a psychiatric determination of dangerousness. They later were transferred to ordinary mental hospitals. After four years, only half of the group was still in the hospitals and only 26 patients who had been judged potentially violent had actually committed violent acts during that time. In the article, the authors said they conducted their research to learn if expert psychological witnesses achieve `` reasonable certainty'' of facts and aid in establishing the truth in trials. `` The scientific evidence clearly suggests that clinicians fail to satisfy either legal standard for expertise,'' they said. Psychological clinicians often are unable to agree on diagnoses, `` much less provide trustworthy answers to ... more difficult forensic questions, which often demand projections backward and forward in time,'' the article said. Expert testimony often can have what the article called `` a prejudicial effect on juries.'' `` Confidence and accuracy can be inversely related, and yet the jury may well accept the opinion of an expert who exudes confidence over that of an opposing expert who expresses appropriate caution,'' the authors said. Evidence from experts, they said, `` is readily subject to abuse'' due to subjectivity and bias. `` The involvement of experts wastes many hours of already too scarce court time and costs taxpayers millions of dollars,'' the article says. When an expert testifies that a psychologist or psychiatrist can predict violent behavior `` he endorses a falsehood'' and could create the risk for malpractice suits against colleagues, the researchers said. <PERSON> Faust </PERSON>, in the interview, said he has testified as an expert in trials in the past, but now refuses to do so because of his belief that his science, at its present state of development, is unable to achieve the expected level of accuracy. Other experts said the question of reliability of psychological testimony has been a matter of controversy, but that it is not clear that such expertise is as unreliable as <PERSON> Faust </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ziskin </PERSON> contend. `` I do n't know of an opinion like that that is generally accepted in the scientific community,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is a controversial position.'' Dr. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a forensic psychiatry expert at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` no professional could give a guarantee that an individual will or will not act violently.'' But he said trials can still benefit from the testimony of experts.

<HEAD>Commuter Planes to Have `Black Box' Recorders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Within three years all but the very smallest commuter aircraft must be equipped with so-called `` black box'' recorders under a new regulation from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Large jetliners already are required to have the recorders which provide information about an aircraft's performance and provide a 30-minute loop tape of conversation in the cockpit. The devices have been critical in finding the cause of many airliner crashes over the years. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recently cited several commuter accidents in which investigations were hampered because adequate information was not available. But commuter planes of less than 30 seats are not required to have the devices. Under a final <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rule announced Thursday, multi-engine, turbine powered commuter planes carrying more than six passengers and flown by two pilots will be required to have cockpit voice recorders. Slightly larger commuter planes carrying 20 or more passengers will have to be equipped with digital flight data recorders that store such information as air speed, altitude, aircraft pitch and heading. Commuter airlines must have the black box recorders within three years of the effective date of the rule, which is expected to be in 90 days. The cockpit voice recorders must be included in new aircraft and retrofitted into planes already in service. The flight data recorders must be in both new and in-service aircraft with 20 or more seats. There is no retrofit requirement for flight data recorders in the smaller commuter planes of less than 20 seats. `` Although the FDR and <ORGANIZATION> CVR </ORGANIZATION> do not enhance safety by themselves they have proven to be invaluable accident investigation tools and have led to numerous improvements in aviation safety,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>. Last year <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> directed the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to expand its requirements for the `` black box'' recorders to include commuter airlines, which last year carried about 32 million passengers.

 Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says he has been trying to get his message across to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks for seven years and is finally making headway, even though his movement is supported by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I can assure you here that we have made a very modest, small, but firm start in talking to the black leaders,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. Before visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to seek support at black churches and from civil rights leaders. He met with some success and appeared at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for a meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday accompanied by the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and a handful of other blacks. `` We have to do all that we can to see to Dr. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> having the support that is necessary,'' <PERSON> Abernathy </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure that he needs our blessing and support and because of his location he is facing many problems.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has been treated as a pariah by American civil rights leaders because his <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> forces receive aid from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in their struggle against the Soviet-backed Angolan government. Opposition to him here has by no means disappeared. About 40 protesters shouting anti-Savimbi slogans demonstrated against him in <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, last Saturday, and he said he encountered other protests in the South. About 25 people demonstrated outside the National Press Building during his appearance, and a man interrupted his speech from the open door of the dining room to shout three times, `` <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> is a murderer.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says he first sought a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and again when he was here in 1986. He said Thursday that he is still hoping for a meeting with the black members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this time. He said he wanted `` to explain the problems of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> in order for the people to know, to listen and to judge. I think those are the fundamentals of democracy.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> told the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> that he saw his first member of the caucus, Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, this trip when <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> chaired his meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> treated him politely. The committee oversees <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. To the criticism of his links with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> says he opposes apartheid, but will take support from anyone willing to give it. He says he is a Democrat who only wants freedom and independence for his country. When he fought against <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colonial rule of his African homeland in the 1960s and 1970s, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid was unavailable to him because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was allied with <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. So he turned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which rejected him, and then to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which gave him guerrilla training. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> lost to the Soviet-backed <ORGANIZATION> MPLA </ORGANIZATION> after the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1975, so he retreated to the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and sought support from the only source available, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Congressional sources, who asked not to be identified, say he is receiving an estimated $ 200 million to $ 300 million in direct South African aid this year, plus the support of the South African military in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conservatives favor his movement because of its opposition to the Soviets. Conservatives succeeded in winning congressional repeal of a law banning aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and in 1986 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> announced $ 15 million in military aid. While the details are classified, the aid continues and is estimated to have climbed to between $ 30 million and $ 40 million this year, including Stinger anti-aircraft missiles that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> credits with stopping air strikes against his headquarters.

<HEAD>Aspin Less Firm On Demand For Contract Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> says he and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> `` are on the same wavelength'' although the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sharply criticized <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s call for a freeze in new contracts to companies mentioned in the Pentagon bribery investigation. The Wisconson Democrat, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> spoke on the telephone late Thursday, shortly after a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman had sharply criticized <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s proposal. `` I called him up and when he talked, we discovered that we're on the same wavelength here,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said `` I do n't think we're that far apart in what we're thinking My goal is to make sure the contracts that are being let now, not the ones involved in the investigation, are free of any taint. That's his goal, too.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> had called Wednesday for a delay of six to eight weeks in awarding contracts to firms mentioned in the 2-year-old investigation of fraud and bribery in Pentagon weapons-buying. No charges have yet been filed. But <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said he's not wedded to the six-to-eight-week time frame `` That's just an idea I threw out,'' he said. <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said he plans to write <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> a letter outlining <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s proposals `` I need to get these ideas down on paper and then he said he'd respond.'' But, said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and I have the same goals. He said he's got people working to come up with a way to make sure the current contracts are n't tainted.'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> and other committee members attended a closed-door briefing Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> about the case. Two legislators said later they expect numerous indictments. Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., said officials `` are very, very sure of their case ... It's pretty ironclad. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky., said, `` many, many indictments will be forthcoming I do n't think it will be too long before the first of them will be coming down.'' Rear Adm. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> NIS </LOCATION>, detailed the case for the legislators. He outlined a `` series of interlocking rings of people, kind of like the Olympic flag,'' in which several groups operated independently, according to one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had rejected <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s call for a halt. A freeze could raise weapon costs, force plant layoffs and hurt military readiness, said spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. `` We would be glad to discuss with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the question of freezing awards of new contracts while the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating allegations of procurement fraud,'' <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said. `` But at this point we feel it would be imprudent to apply such a freeze or moratorium.'' The investigation has also spawned its first two pieces of reform legislation. One would overhaul and centralize the purchasing system while the second would try to end to the so-called `` revolving door'' between the private sector and government. The first measure would create a single buying office, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, to replace the current mix of purchasing agencies scattered throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The second would require <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to wait two years after they quit before working for a defense contractor.

<HEAD>House Judiciary Committee Approves Handgun Waiting Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says it will try to pluck a handgun waiting-period provision out of an anti-drug bill when the measure comes up for a vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'll work to break it out of the drug bill on the floor and get an up-or-down vote on that issue only,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief lobbyist. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> tucked an amendment into the drug bill that would require prospective purchasers of handguns to wait seven days before taking possession, to allow for background checks. `` We will be incapable of making substantial headway in our war against drug trafficking unless we are also prepared to disarm drug dealers and drug traffickers and drug users,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who offered the waiting-period amendment. The proposal withstood a challenge from Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., who attempted to substitute an amendment requiring that a system be developed to identify felons who attempt to buy firearms The McCollum substitute was defeated 22-12, and the waiting period was then approved by a voice vote. <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON> noted that Republicans on the committee did not ask for a recorded vote, and said that is an indication that most members do not want to be publicly reported as opposing `` such a sensible gun-control measure.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is losing credibility in this institution and nationally because they have opposed the most reasonable efforts at gun control,'' said <PERSON> Feighan </PERSON>. `` Their insanity does n't end.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> contends that waiting periods do n't work. `` We think that law-abiding citizens will be the only ones affected and criminals will continue to evade the law,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. During the waiting period, law enforcement agencies could try to determine whether a prospective buyer has a criminal record or a record of mental incompetency. The measure would exempt those who present dealers with certificates from police stating that the purchasers' lives have been threatened. Twenty-two states have some form of waiting periods, with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> having the longest at 15 days. The amendment would supersede less stringent state waiting-period laws, but leave stronger laws standing.

<HEAD>Britains in Tussle Over Proposed U.S. Garbage Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government leaders are fretting over a plan to import millions of tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> household trash to a dump in northwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. One lawmaker said in Thursday's debate in Parliament that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should look into disposing its waste in its own deserts rather than in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Legislator <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said he feared creating the 130-foot-high dump on 390 acres in his home constituency of <ORGANIZATION> Warrington </ORGANIZATION> could introduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop diseases into the area. `` Who would pick up the bill if the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> beetle infected the <LOCATION> Cheshire </LOCATION> potato crop?,'' he asked. Americans should find a place `` in their deserts, perhaps, to deal with their own garbage, rather than add to our own environmental problems,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The garbage is to be shipped from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the rate of 1.5 million to 2 million tons a year for five years by a British company, <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION>, according to Environment Undersecretary <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>. Several African nations have recently expressed outrage over dumping of waste from Western countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, within their borders. In one case, the government of <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said it found 15,000 tons of toxic ash shipped from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and dumped on an island off its coast by a Norwegian company. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> recently announced it was posting vigilantes around its coast to block such dumping by foreign countries. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> defended disposing of foreign waste in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a `` legitimate trade.'' But he said this particular plan `` gives grave cause for concern.'' He said the waste `` is undoubtedly different in kind and scale from the imports we have received so far.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> household garbage contains garden and food waste, so imports `` must involve the risk of pests and diseases being carried with it,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Cheshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved the plan, and <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said he would be holding talks later with that body.

<TEXT>
 A union representing 12,000 state clerical workers and counselors went on strike at midnight Thursday, its president said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Krissel </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said 56 percent of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s second-largest state employees union voted to reject a three-year contract offer. <PERSON> Krissel </PERSON> said the strike would affect statewide operations in welfare and unemployment offices, some bureaus under the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, and some counseling services in prisons and mental institutions. He said the strike would become evident when offices opened in the morning and picket lines went up outside. The bulk of the membership is in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and surrounding areas, the union president said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, said supervisors and non-striking employees will keep offices open. `` We're prepared to do whatever we have to do to maintain services,'' the governor said at an afternoon briefing. <ORGANIZATION> PSSU </ORGANIZATION> struck for two days in 1985 and three weeks in 1975. At issue is the state's effort to institute a two-tier wage scale and vacation package that the union said discriminates against new employees and those at the lower end of the scale, <PERSON> Krissel </PERSON> said. `` We seek a fair across-the-board wage increase for all workers, as well as some added financial recognition for loyal, longer-term employees,'' he said. Although 25 percent of the employees represented by the union are not members, <PERSON> Krissel </PERSON> said he expected they would honor picket lines. Union members in supervisory positions, about 2,000 people, are barred from striking, he added. The state's largest union, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and Municipal Employees, ratified a three-year contract with the state last week.

 Thanks to <PERSON> Astrid </PERSON>'s Law, dogs' tails in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> are safe from cosmetic trimming and barnyard animals are guaranteed a better life, at least until they get to the slaughterhouse. The law, which took effect July 1, was the result of a campaign by children's author <PERSON> Astrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, creator of <PERSON> Pippi </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstocking </PERSON> and a host of other characters who have enchanted children in dozens of countries. It was a remarkable achievement, even for a woman who once helped bring down a government. It reflected the reverence with which Swedes regard a storyteller who has spellbound three generations. The law was Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>'s birthday present from the government. When she turned 80 last November, Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> visited her <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> apartment to tell her the the Animal Protection Law was being drafted and would be informally but affectionately called `` <PERSON> Lex </PERSON> <PERSON> Astrid </PERSON>.'' `` We are going to take much more consideration of the animals' health and well being,'' he told her Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>, a farmer's daughter, long had agitated against cruelty to animals, but the campaign gained momentum last year when she wrote in an open letter to <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>: `` every pig is entitled to a happy pig life.'' She complained that calves often were locked in barns and slaughtered `` without ever seeing a summer pasture.'' She asked <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> `` to make life a little bit easier for many unhappy animals in our country.'' The wide-ranging law guarantees cattle the right to graze, and cows and pigs the right to stalls with straw and bedding. It says chickens should be freed from their coops within 10 years, and animals should be protected from undue suffering before slaughter. It also outlaws the drugging of horses in racing and riding competions and says animals may not be beaten repeatedly with a stick or whip beyond `` a light strike.'' Riding schools and fur farms must be licensed. It made <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> the second country after <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to ban the cropping of dogs' tails for cosmetic reasons. It was not the first time Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> ventured from her fantasy world to shake up the politicians. In 1976 she wrote a satirical fairy tale widely publicized in the daily press dramatizing her complaint against the system of taxation that finances the generous social benefits of the Swedish welfare state. Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> calculated that she paid more than 100 percent in taxes on her income, because of a quirky combination of local tax, income tax and social tax for the self-employed. Her indignation at having to pay to write profitable books contributed to a growing fatigue among the voters with the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which had governed <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for 44 unbroken years. Right-wing opposition parties had decried the tax system as unfair for years, but Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON>'s lament had a far wider impact in the 1976 election. The Social Democrats were ousted, returning to power in 1982. Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> has political punch because she is a non-political national symbol whose books are universally embraced. They are as much a part of growing up in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> as dancing around the maypole in summer and eating herring at Christmas. Many of her 70 books have been translated into 60 languages and have been the source of 29 films or television series. She has won 35 Swedish or international awards since publishing her first book in 1944. Her stories were often set in rural <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, where children romped through green forests in summer, skated on frozen lakes in winter and went fishing in the autumn. Her most popular character is <PERSON> Pippi </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstocking </PERSON>, a rebellious girl with red pigtails, a chest full of money and incredible strength. <PERSON> Pippi </PERSON> mocks society's venerated institutions, such as charitable old ladies, and does n't go to school. The book was an instant hit when it was published in 1945. Her books betray her early interest in animals: <PERSON> Pippi </PERSON> has a horse who lives on the veranda and a monkey named <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON> who sleeps in the house. <PERSON> Emil </PERSON>, an endearing rascal from another popular series, also has a horse and a pet pig. Mrs. <PERSON> Lindgren </PERSON> recently collaborated on an American production of a Pippi Longstocking film and is working on a new book.

<TEXT>
 A September 1986 tip that a private consultant was peddling secret bid information on a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> contract triggered the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> bribery probe that now encompasses scores of companies, consultants and officials, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents show. Affidavits unsealed Thursday in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> say the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> were told that a consultant had approached an employee of a company that had bid on the Marine contract, offering to provide competitors' costs and bid data and government bid evaluations. With the employee's consent, agents recorded his conversations with the consultant, who subsequently was confronted and agreed to cooperate in recording conversations with other individuals. This group of recordings revealed, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said, that defense consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> missile buyer, `` served as a middleman who paid government employees for inside information and sold it to contractors.'' In January 1987, a court ordered tapping of <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON>'s office and home telephones. By April 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said, those wiretaps led agents to tap the telephones and bug the offices of consultant <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. By June 1987, taps and bugs were authorized for the office telephones and office of consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who had resigned three months earlier as assistant <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> secretary for research, engineering and systems. One month later, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it began tapping consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>'s telephones in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> got a court order to tap consultant <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>' telephones in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in September 1987.

<TEXT>
 An 18-year study that revealed the atomic structure of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s most abundant protein could lead to higher crop yields, better drugs to combat cancer and heart disease, and even to more effective laundry detergents, scientists say. The study by biochemist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, `` is very significant work,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norvell </PERSON>, health science administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` It will add a lot to the understanding of how these complex proteins work,'' and therefore may help researchers trying to design proteins to combat several diseases, including diabetes and cancer, <PERSON> Norvell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> and his students published their study today in the journal Science. They spent 18 years bombarding crystals of the protein, named RuBisCO, with X-rays before they successfully produced computer images showing the three-dimensional arrangement of the 37,792 atoms in the protein, which ultimately sustains life by making every plant grow. `` Learning the structure of this protein will aid researchers who are hoping to increase crop yields'' by altering the protein so it makes plants grow more quickly, said <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, a physical chemistry and molecular biology professor at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>. RuBisCO stands for ribulose-1 ,5 - bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, a protein present in all It transforms carbon dioxide into sugar to start photosynthesis, the sunlight-aided process that makes plants grow. `` This protein is vital to all life,'' said retired <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> plant physiologist <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildman </PERSON>, who discovered RuBisCO in 1947. `` We all depend on photosynthesis -LRB- for food -RRB-. This protein performs a key function in photosynthesis. By knowing the structure, clever people like <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> can plot how to modify the structure so the plant would make more matter, which is what we eat.'' The study also is another step in helping scientists learn the rules by which amino acids, the building blocks of life, form complex proteins. Such knowledge eventually may help researchers design proteins to kill cancers, destroy blood clots that cause heart attacks, degrade toxic wastes and even make better laundry detergents, <PERSON> Norvell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> biochemist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said in telephone interviews. Plants on Earth produce 1.1 tons of RuBisCO each second, or 35 million tons per year, <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> said. RuBisCO, which is 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, constitutes half the soluble protein in all plants, making it the most abundant protein on Earth, he added. <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> has already altered RuBisCO's structure to make photosynthetic bacteria double their uptake of carbon dioxide. If he can do the same thing in plants _ an effort that should be aided by <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>'s study _ `` we hypothesize we will obtain faster-growing plants. It could be in the offing in the next five years,'' <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Pullman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, acting director of biology at <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, said 10 years was more likely Success would create crops with `` twice the yield from the same amount of acreage,'' <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said. Knowledge gained from the structure of RuBisCO and other big proteins might help scientists design proteins that could be injected to degrade nutrients and growth factors that promote cancer, <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> coined the name RuBisCO as a play on the brand name <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> because <PERSON> Wildman </PERSON> once hoped to sell the protein as a cheap food source and <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> suggested it could be sold in cracker form. The study took 18 years because <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON> had to have perfect crystals of the protein, which is extracted from tobacco leaves, get X-rays to hit the crystals properly and improve the computer's ability to measure brightness of 40,000 points of scattered X-rays and assemble them into a picture

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday called on the states to trace the sexual partners of people infected with the AIDS virus and urged prisons to test inmates for exposure to the deadly disease. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> urged doctors, as a last resort, to breach confidentiality rules and warn sexual partners of AIDS patients. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> approved the measures by voice vote along with a package of other AIDS proposals before adjourning its annual policy-making convention. `` I think that contact tracing -LRB- of sexual partners -RRB-, at least in the heterosexual community, has the potential to substantially reduce the proliferation and spread of AIDS,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>, executive vice president of the 295,000-member <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s 420-member House of Delegates also approved policies aimed at prohibiting athletes from using steroids, posting health warnings on tanning booths, urging airlines to ban smoking on all domestic flights and evaluating whether health warnings should be required on alcoholic beverages. The delegates passed an amendment that says doctors, as a last resort, have an obligation to depart from their Hippocratic vow of confidentiality to warn sexual partners of persons infected with the AIDS virus. The policy says that doctors should try to persuade patients who are infected with the virus to inform their sexual partners. If the infected person refuses, the doctor should report the person to the local public health department so the officials can warn the sexual partners, under the policy. `` And if that fails, the doctor should tell the people who are at risk directly,'' said Dr. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS Task Force and the association's assistant executive vice president for medical education and science Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, warned that doctors must emphasize the need to protect the identities of AIDS victims. `` I caution us to be very careful to do anything we can to protect confidentiality and to fight any discrimination because it would thwart our efforts to bring this disease under control,'' <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> said. The doctors' organization renewed its call for mandatory AIDS-virus testing of all inmates because of the problems of intravenous drug use and homosexuality in prisons, practices that spread the disease. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> adopted a similar prison-testing proposal last year and reapproved it Thursday despite objections from several doctors that it would accomplish little. The doctors approved what <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> said would be `` broad expansions on contact tracing'' of sexual partners to slow the spread of AIDS among heterosexuals. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> said contact tracing had been effective in reducing such other sexually transmitted diseases as syphilis and gonorrhea. The delegates also called on federal and state governments to expand treatment programs for intravenous drug abusers because they pose the most explosive potential for spreading AIDS into the heterosexual population. By 1991, the nation likely will have 270,000 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, said an <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> progress report issued during the convention. There is no known cure for the disease. Some of the other AIDS policies approved by the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> call for vigorous enforcement of existing anti-discrimination laws to protect AIDS victims against bias in employment, housing and other areas; and urge women to avoid breast feeding if they are infected with the AIDS virus to reduce the chance of giving the disease to their children. Another measure calls for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to keep public attention focused on the epidemic by creating a new national AIDS commission, identical to the one that just finished its work. Such a panel would be a clearinghouse for AIDS research and `` provide the essential coordination between public and private institutions that are addressing AIDS,'' the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> said. In other action: _ The rapid growth of the commercial tanning industry _ with an estimated 17,500 parlors nationwide _ prompted the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> to declare that tanning booths `` pose potentially significant health risks. Delegates voted to lobby the federal government to require warnings in tanning parlors about the increased risks of skin cancer caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light in tanning booths. _ Delegates continued their longtime war on tobacco use, urging commercial airlines to ban smoking on all domestic flights Federal regulations now prohibit smoking on flights of two hours or less. _ The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> urged state legislatures to prohibit athletes from using steroids to enhance physical prowess Improper use of steroids poses dangerous risks such as impairment of a person's sexual functions

 A Soviet journalist said four delegates to a nationwide <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference were suspected of bribe-taking. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the charge was made after a passionate debate on the power of the press to criticize leaders. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, of the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>, gave a list of the delegates to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at Thursday's session of the party gathering, but he did not publically identify them, the official news agency said. He demanded an investigation of the allegations. The edition of <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> published Sunday said delegates from the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> had taken bribes. It said acceptance of bribes by delegates to the first general party conference in 47 years was an indication that large-scale corruption still exists in the Central Asian republic. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> said the investigation that uncovered the bribe-taking was part of a larger probe that implicated the son-in-law of the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. In January, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s relative, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, would go on trial for accepting bribes equal to 270 years' pay for the average Soviet factory worker. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> said the suspected bribe-takers could not be called to account because of connections between the courts and the party, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. He addressed a session on the third day of the conference. His remarks were punctuated by applause and shouts from the floor, where almost 5,000 delegates were seated. `` I would very much like it if the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the general procurator of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at last gave an evaluation of what the investigators are saying, and either punish those about whom we are talking or punish the investigators and journalists who allowed themselves to put innocent people under suspicion,'' he said to loud applause. In an apparent reference to <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> later, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Rafik </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishanov </PERSON> said demagogues are operating `` under the cover of perestroika,'' the name <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has given his plans for social and economic reform. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> took the floor after <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>, head of the conference credentials committee, said a long investigation would be needed to find out if <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>'s allegations were true. The editor said the magazine's material was supplied by investigators who still were following a trail of bribery and corruption tied to former <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> party leader <PERSON> Sharaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> died in 1982 and <PERSON> Rashidov </PERSON> in 1983. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law was first deputy interior minister while <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was alive but was fired soon afterward. Two <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> officials have been executed after being convicted of corruption. Soviet television showed <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, documents in hand, turning to the dais with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> directly behind him. After a cut, it showed the editor answering questions while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> straightened a sheaf of papers. <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> would not identify those suspected of bribery, saying only: `` The four people listed in the documents are delegates to the party conference.'' The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the investigation of <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> had been completed and he would be tried on charges of systematic bribe-taking along with former <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> Interior Minister <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakhyayev </PERSON>, two of <PERSON> Yakhyayev </PERSON>'s deputies and five regional police chiefs. It said two senior officials implicated in the case committed suicide, but did not name them. The bribe-taking allegations were referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Credentials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday during a passionate debate about the power of the state-run press to criticize party and government officials, official reports said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of reforms has emboldened the media to report more openly on once taboo topics.

 <ORGANIZATION> Wire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> members at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> voted 95-31 to ratify a one-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION>, Guild President <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> said Thursday's vote `` signals the beginning of an era of peace between the guild and management, and it's one more message to the news industry that we are here for the long haul.'' The vote, which came after 15 months of negotiations, was counted at the guild's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and announced during the 55th annual convention of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, the parent union of the wire service local. The contract, which runs through July 1, 1989, covers about 700 <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> editorial and other employees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The agreement was reached May 26 with a new guild negotiating team that took over after another team quit May 9 in a dispute with the guild's executive committee. The old contract expired in April 1987. The new pact replaces work rules imposed by the company when it declared an impasse Nov. 1. Three months after that, operating control of the financially troubled news wire service was transferred from <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> publisher <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> WNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a media investment company whose chairman is <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> and whose president is <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said that with a wage increase that took effect Nov. 1 and another scheduled for Nov. 1, 1988, the top minimum pay under the new contract will be $ 670 a week starting in the employee's eighth year of service. Under the old contract, top scale was $ 585 a week, starting in the sixth year. The new pact also improves pensions, restores job security and union dues checkoffs, and continues a health insurance plan put in effect after Nov. 1, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. The guild loses its agency shop provision, under which employees had to pay a fee to the union as a condition of employment, <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. `` The executive committee and the negotiating committee were certain this was the best contract available to <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> employees,'' <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, president of the parent <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` a settlement about which I ca n't say I'm proud, but ... an agreement that was necessary _ necessary for us to survive and equally necessary for <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> to obtain the breathing space needed to regain the viability that has been so sorely in question.'' The company, which lost $ 20 million in 1987, announced March 30 it would seek to reach profitability by eliminating 150 jobs, focusing on business news and embarking on joint electronic ventures.

<HEAD>Radiation Slows Multiple Sclerosis Progression Up to 4 Years,
Study Suggests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Researchers have nearly halted the progression of multiple sclerosis in some patients for up to four years by aiming radiation at specific sites in the body, a new study says. The four-year response is longer than any seen with other experimental therapies, scientists said. The radiation was aimed at depleting the body's supply of white blood cells that are believed to cause symptoms of the disease by attacking nerve tissue. An estimated 250,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, an often crippling condition that can include weakness, difficulty in coordination, dizziness, and loss of balance. Patients in the study had chronic progressive MS, an unremitting form that steadily worsens. The disease also has an `` exacerbating-remitting'' form, in which a patient suffers isolated attacks. About a third of MS cases begin in chronic progressive fashion. Of those that start out as isolated attacks instead, about 60 percent eventually convert to the chronic progressive form. While radiation is probably not the ultimate answer to multiple sclerosis, study co-author <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said, `` right now, if I had chronic progressive MS, I would be very interested in taking part in a trial that was using this.'' `` I think it's promising,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibley </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s committee on therapeutic claims. `` What it needs is confirmation from another group.'' The work is described in the July issue of the journal Neurology by <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, chairman of the neuroscience department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Troiano </PERSON> of the medical school, <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON> <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belleville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and colleagues. The researchers focused the radiation on the spleen and lymph glands in the neck, under the armpits, in the chest and abdomen and above the groin. Twenty-seven patients received radiation and 21 others unwittingly received sham treatments, so that experimenters could account for any psychological benefit from experiencing treatment. The radiation treatments lasted about five weeks. Then the patients were followed for up to 48 months to see how many deteriorated at least one notch on a disability-rating scale. When compared at six-month intervals, 20 percent to 30 percent fewer of the radiation-treated patients than the sham-treatment patients showed that deterioration. Researchers also analyzed results from the 17 radiation-treated patients who showed the fewest remaining white cells three months after treatment stopped. They showed only minimal deterioration in MS disability, averaging less than one notch on the scale, when checked for periods ranging up to four years, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. The other irradiated patients fared significantly worse. No major side effects appeared in the irradiated patients, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Nausea, hair loss, diarrhea and other problems sometimes led to short-term postponements of therapy sessions, researchers said. One death apparently related to the treatment was reported, from complications of a respiratory infection. As for risk of cancer, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said other researchers gave twice as much radiation in a similar treatment program for <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease, a form of cancer, and patients in that study have shown low risk of developing additional cancer 15 years after treatment The next step is to see if other researchers can duplicate the results of the new multiple sclerosis experiment, and to compare the radiation treatment to other experimental therapies, he said. <PERSON> Sibley </PERSON> said the radiation technique has been used for some time in treating <PERSON> Hodgkin </PERSON>'s disease, and its risks are well known and minimal. `` It's probably less toxic than many of the other treatments -LRB- for MS -RRB- that are being recommended these days,'' <PERSON> Sibley </PERSON> said.

 The dollar hit its highest levels of the year against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> during Friday morning trading, continuing its recent advance. Stock prices took a plunge. The dollar opened at 133.57 yen, up a strong 1.37 yen from its previous day closing, and rose rapidly to end the week at 134.50 yen, up 2.30 yen from Thursday's close. It was the dollar's highest level since reaching about 133.95 yen on Dec. 2. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, the market's main barometer, shed 265.87 points, or 0.95 percent, to close at 27,503.53. An exchange dealer at a major commercial bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the local market seemed to be testing whether <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank would take any action to stem the dollar's rise.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could reignite <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s civil war and that Sandinista troops will be on guard despite the renewal of a truce. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Thursday he was extending a unilateral cease-fire until July 31. He also proposed new peace talks with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, which have been fighting the leftist government since 1981. The rebels have not yet replied to his proposal for a new round of talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> July 27-29. In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance on Thursday discussed reviving the talks and using a carrot-and-stick approach with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Contra leader <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said they talked about offering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Sandinistas to induce them to enact promises of democratic reforms. They also discussed renewed military aid to the rebels if the Sandinista refused. Contra commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, said the cease-fire announcement was not important. He said the rebels have said all along that they have no intention of resuming the fighting but will defend themselves if attacked. The rebels rejected a similar invitation for June, saying the Nicaraguan capital did not have an `` atmosphere'' conducive to negotiations. In a pastoral letter issued earlier this week, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s bishops pleaded with the combatants to resurrect the stalled talks and heed the Nicaraguan people's `` heartbreaking clamor'' for peace <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had come to Central American bearing `` a message loaded with hate for the people of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, directed at seeking how to isolate it and seek more resources in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to continue the war against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has criticized <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a `` totalitarian society'' during his three-day trip and compared it unfavorably to the region's four U.S.-backed democracies: <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said `` many dramatic things can occur in the coming days or weeks because something must come of this trip by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> _ a military escalation.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, administration officials have said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to renew military aid to the Contras. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been funding the Nicaraguan rebels since 1981, but military aid to the Contras ran out shortly before the peace talks began. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> spoke Thursday before 1,200 military officers and announced the truce renewal shortly after returning from an official visit to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. His announcement came just hours before the latest in a series of truces with the Contras was to run out. In <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> signed a $ 150 million assistance agreement under which <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> will pardon a $ 50 million debt and give economically crippled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> oil, food and technical assistance with sugar refineries and an industrial plant. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the pact shows `` the willingness of the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> people and government to cooperate with the people and government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to better face the critical situation that North American aggression is imposing on us. `` While <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> makes these decisions, the American government acts in a contrary line,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regards <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as the hemisphere's prime communist threats and has trade embargoes against both nations <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> called his decision to extend the truce a `` demonstration of common sense and responsibility because we do n't want to give up the possibility of a negotiated solution.'' `` But this does not mean that we are going to let down our guard ... because we know that they -LRB- the Contras -RRB- are not going to keep their word and are infiltrating forces from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' The Contras and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agreed to a 60-day truce and peace talks on March 23. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> later renewed the cease-fire and the Contras agreed to go along. Since then, talks between the two sides have broken down and each has accused the other of violating the truce.

 Guerrillas attacked a police station with guns and rocket-propelled grenades early today, and a taxi driver was wounded in the crossfire. Police said the guerrillas made a getaway in a car.

<HEAD>China Marks Day Of Three Billion In Asia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Chinese officials handed out cassette players today to 18 family planning heroes and urged diligence in stemming a new baby boom at a ceremony marking the Day of 3 Billion In <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The day was proclaimed by the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development to draw attention to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> reaching a population of 3 billion this year. Speaker after speaker stood up at the Great Hall of the People in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to warn that rapid population growth poses a threat to economic development. `` We can not think that we can have more children because of economic development ... nor can we relax our efforts because of progress in family planning,'' said <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Keshi </PERSON>, forum vice chairman. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has limited most families to one child since the early 1980s in an attempt to keep its population, now 1.08 billion, from exceeding 1.2 billion at the turn of the century. But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years and officials now tacitly acknowledge that ceiling will be exceeded. After several years in which the population grew by 1.1 percent annually, it soared in 1986 and 1987 to 1.4 percent as a return to family farming and private enterprise inadvertently encouraged couples to have more children as potential sources of income. Another reason for the baby boom is that 360 million children born during the last boom, from 1962 to 1975, have reached child-bearing age, <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> <PERSON> Peiyun </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, told the gathering. She described <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s population problem as severe and said, `` We must take a firm hand ... and never slacken our efforts.'' Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> delivered the same message in a speech on national television and radio Thursday night, but noted the task will not be easy and `` population problems can not be solved within a short period of time.'' Officials have responded to the baby boom by intensifying family planning propaganda, announcing punishments for local officials whose districts exceed their birth quotas and rewarding successful officials. At today's ceremony, 18 family planning workers, doctors and representatives of local districts were given radio-cassette players for `` outstanding performance in implementing our population policy.'' None of the speakers mentioned a growing phenomenon reported Thursday in the official media in which families and district officials fail to register babies that exceed the local quotas, rendering them official non-persons. Such children lack residence permits and can not register for school or receive government ration cards for rice and edible oil. <PERSON> Aprodicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Laquian </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Fund for Population Activities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said one reason for the boom is that local governments often lack the funds to give couples promised incentives for having only one child. The pull of tradition also is strong, and many women whose first child is a girl have a second in hopes of bearing a son to carry on the family line. But in a speech at the ceremony, <PERSON> Laquian </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s efforts should be a lesson to other Asian countries with higher growth rates, such as <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> at 2.61 percent and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> at 1.74 percent. He said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, growing at 1.72 percent per year, likely will surpass <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as the world's most populous country by the year 2050.

 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON>, dryland farmers who depend solely on rainfall, feel almost guilty talking about their thriving wheat fields while farmers in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South pray for rain. `` They lose and we gain _ someone has to suffer to make anything now,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON> said. Around them farms are dust-choked, but the <PERSON> Rhines </PERSON> have enjoyed more than double the usual rainfall for this time of year and are looking forward to one of their best winter wheat harvests ever. In addition, they stand to benefit from wheat prices driven up by crop damage elsewhere. `` We're just abundant, and you go 100 miles southeast of here and it's dry,'' said <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Abundance for the <PERSON> Rhines </PERSON> means 6 or 7 inches of rain in the last two months, compared to about 3 inches during those months most years and an average annual rainfall of about 14 inches. So far this year they also have managed to escape the hailstorms that can wipe out a wheat field in an hour. The <PERSON> Rhines </PERSON>' 3,000 acres lie about 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. A single dry creek runs across the property. The only water their wheat gets comes from rainfall, and the <PERSON> Rhines </PERSON> are more susceptible to moisture levels than farmers who irrigate. <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said most farms along the Front Range are faring well this year. A string of 90-degree-plus days in the middle of June caused some heat stress, he said, but not as much as in areas farther east and south. The <PERSON> Rhines </PERSON> plan to harvest their wheat in two to three weeks, a couple of weeks earlier than usual. They expect to get 35 bushels per acre, near the limit the thin soil can produce, <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, the <PERSON> Rhines </PERSON> had to stop tilling a fallow field when the tractor wheels began kicking up clods of mud after a midday rain shower. `` This is more like <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> weather than <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Rhines </PERSON> have n't always been so lucky. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON>, 57, lived in the same area in 1935 and remembers his wheat-farmer father scraping by, growing just enough food to feed the family while the fields turned to dust. The <PERSON> Rhines </PERSON> got their own farm in 1954, a year that brought a poor harvest. They recall floods that washed away their crops, hail that damaged their fields and more than a few dry spells. In the last five or six years, wheat cost more to grow than it was worth at market, they say, and they lost some extra revenue when two oil wells on their property went bust a few years ago. <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON> said that thanks to the drought in much of the country, wheat prices, which recently topped $ 4 a bushel, likely will stay higher than the $ 3.25 to $ 3.50 he invests per bushel. Other parts of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> have n't escaped the drought and scorching temperatures, which come on the heels of a dry fall and winter. <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agronomist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Echols </PERSON> has predicted the state's winter wheat crop could be reduced by as much as 25 percent. `` The drought helps us, but it's really a disaster for those people,'' said <PERSON> Rhine </PERSON>.'' I do n't think a person should brag very much because it really is n't a very fair thing. ... It's worked just the opposite other times.''

<DATELINE>RANDOLPH, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's largest maker of woodstoves threw a party to mark the demise of its popular Defiant model, the victim of environmental regulations effective today that require new stoves to burn more cleanly. `` The Defiant is a symbol of the end of an era,'' <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Syme </PERSON> said Thursday, calling the woodstove his company's answer to the Model <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Syme </PERSON> decided to forego the gnashing of teeth and complaints about government regulation Instead, his company designed some new stoves and threw a big party for the company's retiring mainstay. Born in 1975 of the energy crisis, a back-to-the-land ethic and a desire by many to thumb their noses at <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and the big oil companies, the Defiant quickly became a symbol of a lifestyle. More than 130,000 stoves have been sold. <PERSON> Syme </PERSON> was an architect who was trying in the early'70s to integrate woodstoves into some of his designs. `` We looked around and did n't see any good ones,'' he said. He got together with his now deceased brother-in-law <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a Wall Street investment banker. `` We sensed that there was a consumer need for a good-looking stove -LRB- on which -RRB- you could open the doors and celebrate this thing of bringing flame into your livingroom,'' <PERSON> Syme </PERSON> said. They caught the market's wave just before it swelled and the company became an overnight success. Sales have declined since the heyday, but <PERSON> Syme </PERSON> said the company has settled into a comfortable niche marketing colorful new stoves, often to upscale city dwellers and suburbanites who want a livingroom showpiece. Thanks to the Defiant, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Castings grew to become the nation's largest woodstove manufacturer and now employs about 400 people, most of them at plants in <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> and nearby <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. Responding to environmental concerns over woodsmoke pollution and the new regulations, the company has introduced two new models designed to cut down on particulates and some of the gasses in woodsmoke. The new EPA rules require stove makers to cut particulates in smoke by 77 percent effective today, and by 81 percent from the pre-1988 standard in 1990. Vermont Castings officials, wary of a patchwork of regulations in states concerned about winter haze, helped the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> devise the new rules, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbell </PERSON>, the company's vice president for marketing. The new stoves meet the standards by burning wood more efficiently, <ORGANIZATION> Kimbell </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that the company has been working with a catalytic combuster designed to burn most of the woodsmoke. <PERSON> Syme </PERSON>, 50, who wore a straw hat and bow tie Thursday as he addressed the crowd of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> dignitaries, company employees and dealers who milled about among balloons, ale and other props under yellow-and-white-striped party tents. `` This is like a commencement,'' he said. `` It's as if we've had a fun time together these last four years in the ivy halls ... and I think we're on the threshold of a new and exciting future.''

<TEXT>
 A movie about a sensitive <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier who increasingly resorts to violence against Palestinians and a documentary on the growing hatred between Jews and Arabs highlight this year's <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Film Festival. Organizers said the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, including the seven-month <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the occupied territories, would be a key theme throughout the 10-day event. `` We wanted to show our concern and also place the festival in a historical context,'' said festival spokeswoman <PERSON> Yael </PERSON> <PERSON> Munk </PERSON>, explaining the selection. The festival was launched Thursday night with the documentary `` Walls'' about the effects of the uprising on Arab and Jewish residents of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the short feature `` Dissolves'' about the experiences of a young <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` Walls,'' a collage of news footage and emotionally charged interviews, shows how the uprising has further raised the barriers of hatred and suspicion between Arabs and Jews in the disputed city. A Jewish slum resident tells film maker, <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, that he would kill all Arabs if he were prime minister. On the other side of town, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> says that while he still judges Jews on an individual basis, his children fear all Jews and the words `` Jew'' and `` soldier'' have become synonymous. Another Jewish resident interviewed in the film says the suffering of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> is nothing compared to what the Jews have gone through in their 2,000-year history. Counters a Palestinian: `` This is not a competition in suffering.'' As an illustration, <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> shows a little girl playing on the gravestone of two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> children killed after a bomb planted by Palestinian guerrillas exploded on an Israeli bus. A few yards down the road, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers gather around the grave of their friend who was killed in the uprising. The feature `` Dissolves'' tells the story of <LOCATION> Gai </LOCATION>, a sensitive 18-year-old from a liberal home who, fresh out of basic training, is sent to the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. In the first scene, a dream sequence, <PERSON> Gai </PERSON> is chasing a young <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> stone-thrower up a hill. When he finally catches up with the stone-thrower, <PERSON> Gai </PERSON> stands frozen because he sees that the boy has wet himself in fear. Nearby, <PERSON> Gai </PERSON>'s right-wing comrade beats another young <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> who shouts `` not in the face, not in the face.'' In another scene, <PERSON> Gai </PERSON>'s unit enounters Arab stone-throwers and one of his comrades is struck in the head by a large brick thrown from a roof. <PERSON> Gai </PERSON> chases the assailant, pulls him to the ground and in a furious rage thrashes him with his rifle until he is pulled off by two other soldiers. In the final episode, <PERSON> Gai </PERSON> returns home and tells his father, who has spent many sleepless nights worrying about his son, that he has killed an Arab woman. Other festival films dealing with the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict are `` Shattered Dreams'' which tackles the theme from the point of view of an Israeli in exile, and `` The Children of Dheishe,'' a documentary about a kindergarten in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp. The festival, which was founded in 1984, offers 130 films from 39 countries, including a retrospective of films by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Munk </PERSON> said organizers received some cancellations, but that no one turned down invitations for political reasons.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rural satellite dish owners moved one step closer to legally receiving cable television programming with a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee vote approving a bill giving independent distributors rights to sell the scrambled programming. The bill was approved Thursday by a narrow 13-11 vote of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee, with many supporters saying they would prefer the industry work out its own solution. `` We are not convinced there is a true marketplace at work,'' said committee chairman Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass. Under the bill, approved 13-11, any cable programmer that sells its programming to at least one distributor other than a cable operator would have to make that programming available to all other distributors. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been concerned that some cable programmers have been unwilling to sell their programming to third-party distributors, thus shutting out potential competitors. But `` the fate of this legislation rests as much in the hand of the affected industries as it does in the hand of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Massachusetts' Fiscal Year Ends With No Budget _ Or Governor _ In
Sight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Republicans criticized Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for campaigning for president out of state the day the state's fiscal year ended with a nearly $ 400 million deficit and no new budget in sight. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration has acknowledged that the state government was technically $ 397 million short of funds for fiscal 1988, which ended Thursday, due to an unexpected slowdown in tax payments and the cost of court-ordered corporate tax abatements. The shortfall comes at an awkward time for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the probable Democratic presidential nominee, who has stressed his managerial skills on the campaign trail. For the last several years <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has had only budget surpluses. To address the problem, the governor filed a supplemental budget with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> containing a 20-point plan to tap cash reserves and make bookkeeping adjustments to close the $ 397 million gap. But House Minority Leader <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> charged Thursday that it was `` inconceivable'' that the Democratic governor would be out of state campaigning with the budget crisis unresolved. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the governor would be working in his office today, Saturday and possibly Monday. `` He is in constant contact with his office. His chief of staff and his secretary of administration and finance are regularly discussing the budget process with legislative leaders,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. In recent years, the state government has often gone several days or even weeks into a new fiscal year without a budget, which must be balanced under the state constitution. Administration and Finance Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> said the government could keep functioning without a budget through Wednesday, when millions of dollars in checks must be issued to cover the state payroll, welfare payments and other obligations. Lawmakers are nearing final approval of a series of tax bills and fee-raising measures that would help pay for expanded state spending projected for fiscal 1989. Meanwhile Thursday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was busy opening envelopes in a drive to collect every possible tax dollar that can be attributed to fiscal 1988 to help cover the $ 397 million deficit. For the coming year, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have endorsed separate budgets that call for spending approximately $ 11.8 billion, or about 8 percent more than fiscal 1988. But the two versions differ in details, and a team of negotiators plans to work through Tuesday on a compromise. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the Democratic legislative leaders have agreed on a spending target of $ 11.8 billion next year, and they have embarked on a program of at least $ 200 million in higher taxes, fines and fees to support the higher spending. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> already has signed a $ 40 million cigarette tax measure. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> three more revenue bills that would raise another $ 163 million by bringing the state income tax back into conformance with federal rules, by closing a corporate tax `` loophole,'' raising fines for traffic violations, increasing wetlands filing fees and claiming unclaimed soft drink and beer bottle deposits. Republicans have charged that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is knowingly overestimating state revenues in order to claim that the budget is in balance.

<HEAD>Researchers Studying Use Of AZT By Health Care Workers Exposed To
AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some doctors and other health workers exposed to the AIDS virus are taking the drug AZT as a preventive measure, despite potentially serious side effects associated with the anti-AIDS medication. AZT _ the only federally approved anti-AIDS drug _ can cause muscle aches, nausea, headaches and severe anemia. Additionally, medical experts have mixed opinions about using AZT, now known as zidovudine, to prevent infection after exposure. Dr. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerberding </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said she is often asked whether the side effects of AZT outweigh the chances of infection after a health worker is pricked with an AIDS-tainted needle. `` I've been bombarded with calls from health care workers around the country,'' said <PERSON> Gerberding </PERSON>, who is directing a study on the risk of AIDS infection among health workers. Researchers believe AZT may keep the AIDS virus from installing itself on the genetic material of cells if the drug is taken soon after exposure, thus preventing AIDS infection. However, the medical community is split over whether the drug should be administered before a patient develops AIDS symptoms. Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volberding </PERSON>, an AIDS authority at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION>, said the odds of AIDS infection in a health care worker with a deep cut who comes in contact with the virus may run as high as one in 100. He said 22 health workers worldwide have become accidentally infected. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the only maker of AZT, began a nationwide study of health workers accidentally exposed to the virus. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the drug company, said workers are required to enroll within five days of exposure. Half will receive a six-week supply of the drug free of charge and half will get a placebo, she said. Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said Thursday they are seeking approval from the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for a similar study that could start within a month. The <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> study, which would concentrate on workers facing `` massive exposures'' to the virus, would not use placebos, said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, who is coordinating the project. <PERSON> Gerberding </PERSON> said she knew two workers at her hospital who took AZT after being exposed to the AIDS virus through tainted blood. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a doctor in private practice who treats AIDS patients, said he prescribed the drug to a surgeon who cut his hand with a scalpel while operating on a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Since patients may acquire AZT through their personal physicians, the number of people taking the drug as a preventive measure is not known. `` Like everything else with AIDS, it's quasi-underground,'' said Dr. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who runs the city's Center of <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, a health clinic. <PERSON> Volberding </PERSON> said he has enough faith in the drug's efficacy that he could not in good conscience advise AIDS-exposed workers to enroll in the <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> study because he'd be afraid they would get the placebo. However, Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said if he was accidentally exposed to the virus he probably would enroll in the <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> study rather than take the drug on his own.

<TEXT>
 A 2-year-old who was kidnapped as a baby and adopted by an Israeli couple returned home clutching her Brazilian parents and a teddy bear. Her mother said she would someday allow her child to decide if she wants to meet her adoptive parents in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, even though her lawyer said the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> couple knew something was amiss in the adoption. <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasconcelos </PERSON> arrived Thursday at <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>'s international airport with her parents, <PERSON> Rosilda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasconcelos </PERSON>, on a flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. They had stopped there en route from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` I feel as if <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> and I never had been separated, that she was never kidnapped,'' the child's mother told reporters while the brown-haired girl played with their tape recorders and microphones. The child also smiled and waved. The <PERSON> Vasconcelos </PERSON>' two-year ordeal started Oct. 13, 1986, when their child, then 4 months old, was abducted from their home in the southern city of <LOCATION> Curitiba </LOCATION>. One year later, the child was located in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the couple regained custody after a court battle with her adoptive parents. Asked if she would one day allow <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> to visit her former adoptive parents, Mrs. <PERSON> Vasconcelos </PERSON> said: `` When she is older, I will tell her the whole story of what happened to her. Then she will be able to decide on her own whether or not she wants to see them again.'' Shortly after arriving back in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the child, dressed in a green jump suit, romped through the baggage-claim area, rode the conveyor belt and wheeled around a pushcart. Occasionally, she interrupted her play to embrace her parents. The family later boarded a plane for <LOCATION> Curitiba </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION> state authorities planned a big reception and meeting with Gov. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Dias </PERSON>. At a brief news conference held in the airport's press room, Mrs. <PERSON> Vasconcelos </PERSON>, looking tired but composed, held <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> on her lap and said, `` I never doubted I would be reunited with my daughter. It's a marvelous feeling having her back, and I owe it all to my faith in God, luck, persistence and the many people who helped me.'' Police say <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON>'s kidnapping was the work of one of many baby-trafficking rings that abduct or buy infants from mothers in poor areas and sell them for hefty profits to childless foreign couples. Adoption by foreigners is legal in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, but it is a time-consuming bureaucratic process that sometimes takes several years. With phony or even legitimate papers obtained through corrupt officials, the baby-trafficking rings can arrange an adoption within weeks, police say. The Israeli couple who adopted <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Turgeman </PERSON>, paid $ 25,000 to intermediaries but said they acted in good faith, believing the high fee and documents were legal. But <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuber </PERSON>, the Israeli lawyer who helped the Brazilian couple get their daughter back, said: `` The Turgemans may not have known <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> had been kidnapped, but they certainly knew something was fishy. They knew the documents were phony.'' <PERSON> Schuber </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> back to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, said: `` They had to know something was illegal about the whole thing. No one goes to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> to adopt a Brazilian child and thinks it's all legal.'' Almost immediately after her abduction, <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> was taken across the border to neighboring <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, where she was handed over to the Turgemans. About one year afterward, <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> was located near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Her parents contacted Brazilian authorities for help in getting her back, and earlier this month, the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decided she should be returned to her parents in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Vasconcelos </PERSON> said that at first her relationship with the Turgemans `` was just fine. They seemed understanding and were willing to cooperate. But later the relationship deteriorated.'' She declined to say why. <PERSON> Olavo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Souza </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Curitiba </LOCATION> radio reporter who covered the story in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for more than a month, said the relationship soured when the Israeli couple `` tried to convince the Vasconceloses to abandon the idea of taking <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON> home.'' `` When they saw the Vasconceloses would not consider such a proposition, they filed an appeal in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to postpone <PERSON> Bruna </PERSON>'s return. But the court turned them down,'' <PERSON> Souza </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Vasconcelos </PERSON> said the Turgemans treated her daughter well. `` But the way they raised her was nothing special,'' she said. `` They did n't do anything I would not do.''

 A novice nun abducted by her family from a renegade Catholic convent says she was n't kidnapped and does n't want to press charges, but a convent official accused the woman's parents of `` brainwashing'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON>, 22, also known as Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON>, voluntarily appeared at the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Department Thursday with her parents, <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, and the family's lawyer. `` She expressed to us that she has no animosity or any bad feeling toward members of her family or anyone else, and that she is where she is -LRB- with her parents -RRB- because she wants to be where she is,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulgin </PERSON>, chief of detectives. Misdemeanor charges have been filed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state against four of her relatives for the alleged abduction Sunday. Police did not arrest the family members because the charges are misdemeanors from another state. Ms. <PERSON> Greve </PERSON>, a novice at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novitiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convent </ORGANIZATION> for 20 months, was allegedly pushed into a waiting car by her brother <PERSON> David </PERSON> as she walked with two nuns on a street near the convent in <LOCATION> Roundtop </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hulgin </PERSON> said the parents told police they took their daughter because they were upset by a lack of communication with the convent, which calls itself a traditionalist Roman Catholic convent. The sect holds services in Latin and rejects the liberal teachings of the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s. The sect, called the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> V </ORGANIZATION>, split from the recognized <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> traditionalist <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 over philosophical differences. The sect is not recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. A tape of the local police interview with Ms. <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> has been mailed to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, who will use it to decide whether to drop charges, <PERSON> Hulgin </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> appeared to be clear-headed and comfortable during the interview, <PERSON> Hulgin </PERSON> said. `` She seemed to be in total control of herself. She had no reservations about speaking to us,'' he said. `` She was very cooperative. She gave us no firm commitment as to what her future intentions were.'' Despite Ms. <PERSON> Greve </PERSON>'s statement to police, the convent's spiritual adviser, the Rev. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, said Thursday he was not convinced she was acting on her own. `` I would like to talk to her without her parents present to determine in fact that she is acting according to her own free will,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` There was no question about the force used in her abduction. Now she is being held in captivity for a number of days. I'm afraid they've subjected her to some type of brainwashing,'' he said. In April, the family took Ms. <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> from the convent for a medical check-up, but a nun was waiting for them in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and persuaded Ms. <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> to return to the convent, said her brother <PERSON> John </PERSON>.

 City officials have pulled the plug _ at least temporarily _ on two entrepreneurs who want to reintroduce the electric rolling chair to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s famed boardwalk. Antique wicker rolling chairs that now transport tourists down the wooden way are pushed by hand for a fee. But Ernest English and <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> discovered that mechanical chairs were popular several decades ago, and want to restore them in an updated version. They recently bought all 100 dormant licenses for electrically propelled rolling chairs from the city. Then they created a prototype of a new chair _ a version that looks more like an enlongated, covered golf cart than the wicker original. That's when the rolling chair war began. `` It's a power play,'' English said. `` Rolling chairs can earn about $ 350 a day, so it's a money thing. I understand that over 40 people came in this week looking for electric chair licenses. We've become a commodity that everyone wants. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s legal definition of a rolling chair, contained in a 1950 ordinance, is a wheeled vehicle for hire for the transportation of two or three people. A later ordinance restricts their length to 88 inches, or slightly more than seven feet. The prototype electric chair introduced by English and <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> is 10 feet long and seats five plus the driver. City officials pulled the partners' licenses Thursday, ordering the new contraption off the boardwalk after only four days in business. They plan to meet with the men next week. English, 30, and <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>, 31, acknowledge their cart is controversial, and plan to redesign it to make it more conventional.

 Stock prices took a plunge today as the dollar continued its climb against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dollar opened at 133.57 yen, up a strong 1.37 yen from the previous day's closing. It rose rapidly to end the week at 134.50 yen, up 2.30 from Thursday's finish. The dollar closed today at its highest level since Nov. 27, when it finished at 134.75 yen. It ranged between 133.55 and 134.60 yen today, with spot volume estimated at $ 9.8 billion. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, the market's main barometer, shed 265.87 points, or 0.95 percent, closing at 27,503.53. The loss came after a rally of 371.31 points over the previous two trading days. `` Share prices fell because the stock market was adjusting itself to the weaker yen,'' said a broker with a major securities firm who spoke on condition of anonymity. But he noted that activity was very heavy, with 2.6 billion shares traded in the first section. Volume was up from 2.5 billion shares traded on the first section Thursday. Among the issues posting sharp losses were steels, heavy industrials and electricals, the trader said. Also losing ground were constructions, nonferrous metals and textiles. Low-priced issues, including trading houses and shippings, held on to earlier gains, traders said. Foreign exchange dealers said the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market seemed to be testing whether <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank would take any action to stem the dollar's rise. `` Right now it is unclear how far the government is willing to let the dollar go,'' said an exchange dealer with a major commercial bank. `` But it is rumored that Finance Minister -LRB- <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> sees the 138-yen level as acceptable.'' The trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> had stepped into the market today to stem the yen's slide. The central bank does not comment officially on its market interventions. Earlier this week, Japanese monetary authorities, including <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, said the central bank would use market intervention if necessary to brake the dollar's upswing.

<HEAD>AMA Approves Policy To Warn Sexual Partners Of AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's largest group of doctors says physicians, as a last resort, must breach their centuries-old tradition of confidentiality by warning the sexual partners of those infected with the AIDS virus. The move during Thursday's final session of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention was part of a package of tough policies for battling the AIDS epidemic, including calls for mandatory testing of prison inmates and expanded programs for intravenous drug users. `` This is a landmark in the history of medical ethics,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the new president of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are saying for the first time that, because of the danger to the public health and the danger to unknowing partners who may be contaminated with this lethal disease, the physician may be required to violate patient confidentiality.'' However, another <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> official said the policy was not new. `` This is a restatement of a position the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> has had for at least a half a year, and possibly as long as a year,'' said Dr. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS Task Force and the association's assistant executive vice president for medical education and science. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s 420-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that as the first course of action, a physician should try to persuade a patient infected with the AIDS virus to notify his sexual partners. If the patient refuses, the doctor should report him to the local public health department so that health officials can warn his sexual partners, a practice called contact tracing. `` And if that fails, the doctor should tell the people who are at risk directly,'' said <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>. Although the tradition of doctor-patient confidentiality goes back to the Hippocratic oath, <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said, `` The landmark decision, if there is one, is that this is the first time somebody has called for contact tracing in every jurisdiction.'' Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>, executive vice president of the 295,000-member medical association, said contact tracing `` at least in the heterosexual community has the potential to substantially reduce the proliferation and spread of AIDS.'' <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> said tracing had been effective at reducing other sexually transmitted diseases, such as syphilis and gonorrhea. Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, warned that doctors must protect the identities of AIDS victims. `` I caution us to be very careful to do anything we can to protect confidentiality and to fight any discrimination because it would thwart our efforts to bring this disease under control,'' <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> said. The notification policy was attacked by a gay-rights group, which said it could make AIDS patients or those who suspect they have been exposed to the disease wary of seeking treatment, according to a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` If patients feel doctors are going to rat on them, whether they're homosexual or heterosexual, they're not going to go to their doctors,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lamda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> also said that in conjunction with the notification policy, it would back legislation to grant immunity to doctors in states with strict patient confidentiality laws. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> also called for mandatory AIDS testing of inmates because of the problems of intravenous drug use and homosexuality in prisons, practices that spread the disease. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> adopted a similar proposal last year and reaffirmed it Thursday despite objections from several doctors that it would accomplish little. The delegates also called on federal and state governments to expand treatment programs for intravenous drug users because they pose the greatest danger for the further spread of AIDS into the heterosexual population. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's ability to fight disease. It is fatal and incurable. Before adjourning its five-day convention, the delegates also approved policies aimed at prohibiting athletes from using steroids, posting health warnings on tanning booths, urging airlines to ban smoking on all domestic flights and evaluating whether health warnings should be required on alcoholic beverages.

 The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated a bill to create a holiday honoring slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a proposal that touched off widespread criticism of former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> when he opposed it. The King measure fell two votes short of the 16 needed in the 30-member, Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Two Republicans who initially supported the bill, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Safford </LOCATION>, voted against it Thursday in what they said was a protest against heavy-handed efforts by Democrats to force a vote on the issue. `` I do n't vote for extortion,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Macdonald </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> Democrat <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said he believed that they voted against the bill because they both face tough re-election fights and do not want to alienate conservatives. Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford had campaigned for the bill and still could try to designate a holiday by executive proclamation. But Republican Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> has said such a move would be illegal and could subject a governor who tried it to legal costs. Then-Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, in 1987 cited <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s advice when he rescinded such a proclamation made by <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s predecessor, Democrat <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, for a King holiday for state executive branch The move incited nationwide criticism of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was eventually impeached and removed from office on unrelated charges. <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, a former attorney general himself, has insisted such a proclamation is legal. Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> has repeatedly refused to say what she would do if lawmakers did not enact the measure. Gubernatorial chief of staff <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said after Thursday's vote that she was still studying options that included calling lawmakers back into special session on the measure or going ahead with a proclamation. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> had blocked the King measure from coming to the floor all session, and Democrats demanded a chance to vote on it as part of their price for supporting a tax bill needed to help eliminate a projected budget shortfall.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made an emotional plea for his proposals to redistribute power in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, emphasizing that political change is essential if his economic reform is to succeed where similar attempts failed. He took the floor for the second time before 5,000 delegates at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference he called to assess his reform program. In his 40-minute speech Thursday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested that Soviet socialism will die if his proposals to restore more real power to local legislative councils are blocked. `` Society is waiting for it,'' he said. `` The whole of socialism is waiting for it.'' Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, criticized by some delegates Thursday for having `` fallen behind the times,'' opened today's session, Soviet television reported without giving details Pollution was among the topics raised today. <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON>, the head of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s new environmental protection agency, said the rush to build giant factories had destroyed fertile soil, ruined forests, raised air pollution above healthly levels and contaminated water supplies. `` Those who created these problems should be identified and give their due,'' <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON> said. His remarks to the closed-door session of the first party conference in 47 years, were carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech ate into the schedule of a conference where only 47 delegates of 261 who asked for the floor have spoken. Officials originally said the gathering would end today. Also breaking into the schedule was a conflict over the reformist journal <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations that certain delegates from the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> took bribes. <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>'s party chief, in an apparent reference to the magazine's editor, <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, countered that demagogues are operating `` under the cover of perestroika,'' the name <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has given his plans for reform. Among those waiting to speak, an official said, is <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, ousted as party boss in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last fall for criticizing the slow pace of reform. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> area delegate demanded <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> be given the floor so the conference could hear his views. In his speech Thursday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that a call he made in his first speech Tuesday for vesting real power in legislative councils, known as soviets, had been misunderstood. `` We do not abandon the leading role of the ruling party in the country,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` On the contrary, we emphasize it.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed Tuesday that local party heads should be elected chairmen of the soviets in a secret ballot. The proposal seemed designed to ensure that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retains its traditional control over Soviet society, but operates through a forum elected by the people rather than a government executive body. Under the proposed reforms, party leaders `` of all ranks'' will be selected in secret ballot, multicandidate elections. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not say if this would apply to his own post of general secretary nor whether he would stand for the proposed new post of president to be elected by a proposed 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. In Thursday's speech, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recalled how earlier economic reforms in the 1950s and 1960s were `` swallowed up'' because there was no accompanying political change. His `` perestroika'' could go the same way without political reform, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated. `` Doubt, lack of confidence, that would be the greatest gifts to the opponents of perestroika,'' he said. `` Socialism, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, that is the creative activity of the masses,'' he said. `` But that activity will die unless we reform the political system.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> broke into a speech by a delegate who said people feel party stalwarts can not work under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms if they previously carried out the now-discredited policies of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who died in 1982. `` Maybe you have some concrete suggestions?'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked delegate <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> from his position on the dais. `` We're sitting here and do n't know: Is he talking about me, or somebody else? `` I was referring first of all to <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, and to <PERSON> Comrades </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>,'' replied <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON>, head of the party in the <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. The exchange was shown on national television in an extremely rare attack on named members of the ruling Politburo. Such criticism has not surfaced despite the recent growing independence of the Soviet press. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> and another Politburo member, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, have been members of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since the 1960s. <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, one of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s foremost experts on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs, has headed the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> since 1967. There are at least two delegates with the surname <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>. One is <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Afanasyev </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda since 1976.

<HEAD>No Damages Awarded for Loss of Bull Semen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLFAX, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owners of Blitz, a prize bull, should not be compensated for the bull's death or the loss of his valuable semen, a jury has decided. <PERSON> Alvene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinweber </PERSON> had sued <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinnenkamp </PERSON> for $ 150,000, claiming Blitz was fatally wounded in 1983 while defending his herd against a trespassing <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> owned by the defendants. The Leinwebers claimed Blitz was the foundation of their breeding business, <ORGANIZATION> Palouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pinzgauer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeders </ORGANIZATION>, 11 miles north of <LOCATION> Colfax </LOCATION>. They said Blitz had to be put to sleep months after the alleged fight, since he could n't stand up long enough to have his semen extracted. Blitz's semen cost about $ 20 a sample and was sold throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Leinwebers </PERSON> said. The Hinnenkamps acknowledged their bull broke out of its pasture and flirted with <PERSON> Blitz </PERSON>'s cows, but denied it attacked Blitz. After an eight-day civil trial in <ORGANIZATION> Whitman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, jurors decided Wednesday the Hinnenkamps were not liable for their <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION>'s rambling, nor were they negligent for not preventing the bull's activity. The decision came despite an earlier plea from the Leinwebers' attorney, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Schauble-Ruff </PERSON>, to award damages `` The Leinwebers are approaching their golden years and were looking forward to the -LRB- financial -RRB- comfort Blitz could have given them,'' she told jurors. `` But that ca n't happen now. They've got only 800 units of semen left to hoard.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Libey </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Hinnenkamp </PERSON>'s attorney, said Blitz could have died from accidents other than a fight. He suggested Blitz may have simply over-exerted himself while mating, injuring both hind legs.

 Despite gloomy reports of drought damage to the nation's breadbasket, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> is far from a basket case and the final impact of the dry spell remains unclear, experts say. `` People are ready to write the whole <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> off,'' said <PERSON> Jerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think there's a reason to have some moderation in this. `` We're not likely to see a disaster, on one side, and we're also not likely to see the crops come through unscathed,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday from his <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> office At <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION>, researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said that because of the great variation in the drought's impact it could be disastrous for some farmers and beneficial to others. It recommended any government relief programs target assistance to just those farmers hurt by the drought. `` Crop farmers who lose all or almost all of their crops will suffer obvious losses,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, the center's associate director `` Livestock producers are caught in a tight squeeze _ higher feed and forage prices cause early marketings that are reducing current livestock prices. `` However, farmers whose crops are less affected by the drought will gain significantly from higher crop prices, as will those who have grain in storage,'' said <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> backed away from an earlier warning that the drought could cut short a recovery by farm banks. `` Farmers look like they have some staying power. Farm bankers, too,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorash </PERSON>, banking analysis officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, who surveyed agricultural banks in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Just two weeks earlier, in preparing an annual review of <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> farm banks, <PERSON> Gregorash </PERSON> made a more dismal assessment, saying the drought `` could make the 1987 gains short-lived.'' But after surveying bankers this week, <PERSON> Gregorash </PERSON> said, `` The news is fairly good.'' All of the analysts say the drought's final impact remains unknown and point to the huge fluctuations in commodity markets each time rain falls in the Farm Belt or is even forecast as signs of the uncertainty. `` Changing weather is likely to result in wide swings in prices between now and harvest,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, director of the center at <ORGANIZATION> ISU </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ISU </ORGANIZATION> said the best that can be hoped for, through a shift to ideal conditions for the rest of the growing season, is average national corn yields dropping 15.6 percent to 100 bushels an acre, soybeans dropping 9.1 percent to 30 bushels an acre and wheat dropping 6 percent to 36 bushels an acre. Average normal yields are 118 -LCB- bushels an acre of corn, 33 of soybeans and 38.3 of wheat, said research associate <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Westhoff </PERSON>. The most severe forecast, comparable to a drought like that of Dust Bowl days, would reduce corn yields by 40 percent, soybeans by 27 percent and wheat by about 15 percent. A moderate scenario, based on a slight intensifying of current drought conditions, would fall midway between the best and worst outlook and would reflect conditions as severe as any drought of the past 25 years, <PERSON> Westhoff </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas planted explosives that injured 33 people in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s capital last year and tried to blow up a strategic bridge there in 1984, a Vietnamese army officer said today. Col. <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON>, commander of an elite unit assigned to protect <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, provided a rare disclosure of guerrilla infiltrations. But he said the capital has been very secure since <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and set up a pro-Vietnamese government. He dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla infiltrators, as `` leftovers of an army that was beaten up and became bandits.'' <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> said the last members of his unit, 1,200 men, returned home on June 6 as part of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s plan to withdraw 50,000 troops, or half its force in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, by the end of the year. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says its military command and all military advisers returned home on Thursday, turning responsibility for the war over to <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> officers. About 50,000 Cambodians, according to official count, turned out on the streets of their capital as about 300 Vietnamese commanders left <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> and flew to <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> acknowledged it lost 25,000 men in the war, but most of the fighting was away from the capital. <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> said that no Vietnamese soldiers had been killed in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> since he took up his post in January 1979. There were no major attacks on the city and most intrusions were on its outskirts, he said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s army rarely provides details of operations. The only reports of guerrilla infiltration into <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> have come from highly exaggerated <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> claims or sketchy accounts from a few Western aid officials. Fanatic <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> communists killed millions of people when they ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion. <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> spoke with foreign journalists invited to cover the Vietnamese pullout. He said the worst period was from March 23 to July 20 last year when <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> agents planted 44 Chinese-made explosives on the outskirts of the city. The plastic-covered bombs, about 4 inches in diameter and 1 -LCB- inches wide, exploded when touched, he said. `` The intention was to scare people,'' he said. `` They laid the explosives in the people's water tanks, bus terminals, staircases of people's houses, or on the road.'' <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> said 33 people, all civilians, were wounded, including six Vietnamese living in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The leader of the saboteurs, a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> battalion commander, was sentenced to death and another suspect, a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> underground activist, sentenced to life imprisonment, <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> said. Authorities also captured 15 others whom the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> had paid $ 500 for each bomb they placed, he said. They received shorter jail terms or were put in political `` re-education'' camps. He said the second most serious attack was the firing of two H-12 rockets into the city on Dec. 27, 1986. Both crashed into paddy fields, causing no injuries, and a <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> operative who launched the rockets was captured, he said. <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> also said six <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> operatives were caught in an abortive plot to blow up the <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ngoc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> bridge </LOCATION>, the capital's biggest, which links its eastern and western sectors The plot was organized in 1983 and explosives were to be planted in early 1984, he said. <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> said the chief plotter, <PERSON> Mon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ly </PERSON>, was sentenced to death and the five others were given prison terms or probation. While <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> said guerrilla-related incidents in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> were declining, he did not discount claims by diplomats that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> was lying low to prepare for attacks in 1990, when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says its last soldiers will leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He said some Cambodians in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> reacted to this year's pullout with apprehension about the return of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Ninh </PERSON> said guerrillas also conduct limited psychological warfare in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, distributing handwritten leaflets saying `` that Khmer -LRB- Cambodians -RRB- should not fight Khmer. The Khmer should fight the Vietnamese.'' The Vietnamese colonel said military intelligence indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> exaggerated its strength in referring to `` Division 18,'' the unit that was behind the 1986 rocket attack and the 1987 explosions. `` A division should have about 10,000 soldiers,'' he said. `` But they have only 250 people and call themselves a division. Nonsense. They do n't have any strategy or tactics.''

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> nuclear weapons laboratory was shut down today after an electrical transformer blew up in a fireball seen a mile away, touching off a series of explosions and fires. The blasts and fires Thursday night at the laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed, followed a power outage that plunged the 500-building complex into darkness, said laboratory spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>. There were no injuries reported and the three fires were put out in about an hour, she said. Most of the damage took place at the lab's main switching substation, a long metal structure. `` The windows were turned brown by the flames and firefighters chopped holes in the roof,'' said <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, who estimated damage to the building at $ 250,000. The fires began when the main transformer in the switching building exploded, sending an electrical surge into transformers at the two other buildings, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the lab's emergency duty officer. The other explosions and fires were at power transmission boxes outside two other buildings. Those fires also burned some nearby bushes. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said that when the main transformer blew up, it sent up a fireball that was visible from his home, about a mile away. The fires were all several blocks from the high-security building where plutonium is stored and did not affect any section of the lab where nuclear materials are kept, <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> said. `` They are safe and secure,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Borunda </PERSON> declared her everlasting love for her husband <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> in a newspaper wedding anniversary advertisement, but police say it was a love as thin as the paper it was printed on. The same day the newspaper ran her `` happy fourth anniversary'' ad, it also reported that Mrs. <PERSON> Borunda </PERSON> was charged with soliciting a gunman to shoot her husband. Mrs. <PERSON> Borunda </PERSON> already had paid the gunman $ 1,000 and was to provide an additional $ 1,500 after her husband was killed during what was to have been a staged house break-in, Detective <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> said Thursday. She was arrested Saturday on a tip provided by a relative, <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> said. `` Then we see this happy ad in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> -RRB- Herald-News,'' said <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON>. `` It's getting to the point where I just do n't know about things any more.'' The ad read: `` Happy fourth anniversary 6 @ 29 @ 88 to my wonderful husband <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Borunda </PERSON>. I'll love you always. Your wife <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>.'' In the same Wednesday edition, the newspaper reported that Mrs. <PERSON> Borunda </PERSON>, 44, was charged Tuesday with a single count of solicitation to commit murder. She has entered a plea of innocent and is free on $ 1,000 bond posted by her husband pending a July 11 court hearing. `` And he turns around and bonds her out, anyway,'' said <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON>. `` Go figure.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Borunda </PERSON>, 59, who is the woman's fifth husband, told police he had several life insurance policies worth well over $ 100,000, <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> said. `` That's the only motive we've determined so far,'' <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Borunda </PERSON> allegedly contacted one relative who declined to help her find a gunman, then contacted a second relative who put her in touch with someone willing to carry out the murder, <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> said. `` The first relative was the one who tipped us,'' said <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, an advertising manager for the newspaper, said the advertisement was phoned in, making it impossible to confirm whether Mrs. <PERSON> Borunda </PERSON> actually placed it. `` But the bill is going to her,'' said <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. `` That's the name and address given by the person who called.''

 <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has expelled the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval attache to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> for photographing an Iranian ship loading cargo in a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> port, a published report said today. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> denied the report. The weekly Independent newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying the attache, Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> on Wednesday. But <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman My <PERSON> Chau </PERSON> <PERSON> Bui-Griffin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> in early May following routine transfer orders from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She said he had served as naval attache in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> since March 1985. Mrs. <PERSON> Bui-Griffin </PERSON> declined to comment on the allegations reported by the Independent. She said it was not <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> policy to comment on individual newspaper reports. The Portuguese Foreign Ministry and the prime minister's office said no one was immediately available to comment. The paper said the attache at first said he was a journalist when challenged by port authorities as he allegedly photographed the Iranian ship at <LOCATION> Setubal </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. Photographing state-owned installations is an offense in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in some circumstances. He later admitted he was a diplomat after being taken to a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> naval base for questioning, according to the report. It said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> was recognized by several <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> naval officers at the base. Portuguese state-owned companies sell arms to both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its enemy <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, and the weapons are loaded at the port of <LOCATION> Setubal </LOCATION>. The newspaper did not say whether the cargo <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> reportedly photographed included arms. The Indepdendent said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> after Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> summoned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowell </PERSON> and informed him of the <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> government decision to expel the diplomat.

<BYLINE>AIDS POLICIES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The delegates approved a package of policies for battling the nation's AIDS epidemic. One proposal calls on states to trace the sexual partners of people infected with the AIDS virus as a strategy for slowing the deadly disease's spread into the heterosexual population. Another says physicians, as a last resort, have the obligation to stop the spread of AIDS by departing from their rule of confidentiality and warning the sexual partners of anyone infected with the virus. The other policies adopted included a recommendation that prisons test inmates for exposure to the AIDS virus, a call for expanded treatment programs for intravenous drug abusers and a proposal that the president form a new AIDS commission to coordinate public policies.

 A lawmaker belonging to the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> charged today that a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> official sought to protect Premier <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo-hwa </PERSON> by covering up a bribe attempt. The allegation was the latest in a series of accusations launched against <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> by lawmaker <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yung-hsiung </PERSON>. Next week, the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will hold a key party congress during which the premier's conservative policies may come under attack by younger politicians. Opinion polls indicate <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>, 74, is not as popular as other <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> leaders, and some Nationalist lawmakers have called for his resignation. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> claimed that <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-ching </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, was ordered to bribe him on <PERSON> Yu </PERSON>'s behalf. The lawmaker claimed Tuesday that <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> told <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> to pay $ 11,360 to silence Wu from attacking the premier during sessions of the Legislative Yuan, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s highest lawmaking body. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> has repeatedly accused <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> of having an affair with a prostitute, but has failed to provide details other than a woman's name <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> has denied the allegation. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> has denied that the money he paid <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> was a bribe. He said the cash was a personal gift to help finance the lawmaker's trip to visit labor welfare programs in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Officials Deny Police Killed Pollution Protesters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials today denied Western reports that police killed several peasants and brutally beat others who tried to stop the release of polluted water from a reservoir near <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday issued the first official report of the June 21 protest during which peasants tried to stop a petrochemical company from releasing contaminated waste water from a reservoir into a local stream. The peasants said the water would poison their wells and crops. Officials said the water level in the reservoir had risen too high and that there was danger of flooding. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuoseng </PERSON>, local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary, criticized foreign reporting of the protest and accused Western reporters of violating government regulations this week when they visited the reservoir in <LOCATION> Guce </LOCATION> village. Authorities there turned away some Western reporters this week and confiscated film and audio tapes. Guce, which is under the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> municipal administration, is 37 miles southwest of the city center. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> cited the same regulation that was used last October to expel 14 Western reporters from <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> following violent pro-independence, anti-Chinese riots by Tibetans in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. The regulation requires foreign reporters to apply for permission when traveling to report in areas open to foreigners. Reporters previously had interpreted it to apply to places outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and officials have never before invoked it in greater <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The new interpretation would significantly widen the scope of the regulation and severely limit foreign reporting in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. At today's news conference, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said the July 21 protest was much smaller than peasant witnesses have said. He denied witness accounts that thousands of armed police were brought in and scores of peasants were badly hurt. Villagers told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that more than 1,500 farmers clashed with at least 2,000 armed police, and 60 to 70 protestors were seriously injured when police beat them with nightsticks and used electric cattle prods. Some villagers told Western reporters that three people were killed, but those who spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> said they could not confirm any deaths. `` What you're talking about is what a small number of people are saying. I was at the site. I can assure you that there were no more than 500 farmers,'' <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said. He said about 200 unarmed local police were at the scene. He denied that anyone was killed or seriously injured, but said some people might have been slightly hurt during the scuffle. Villagers also said 150 people were arrested the day of the protest, and that 10 remained in custody, but <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said only five people were being interrogated.

 Forty-three years after he died in self-imposed exile in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the remains of composer <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> are on the way to reburial in his native <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The remains left <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> today on the second stage of their journey. The liner Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> 2, which brought the remains here from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Thursday, set sail at 11:33 a.m. for <LOCATION> Cherbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and was expected to arrive there seven hours later. In <LOCATION> Cherbourg </LOCATION>, the brown-painted, sealed wooden box will be put on a train to begin a slow, five-day journey through <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Memorial concerts were scheduled today in <LOCATION> Cherbourg </LOCATION> and Sunday in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, and the body was to lie in state Monday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> before the ceremonial state burial in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> next Thursday. `` <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> was one of the greatest musical figures this century ... His genius has enhanced the reputation of Hungarian culture throughout the world,'' <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said at a memorial concert Thursday night at <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> gave 50 piano performances in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> between 1904 and 1938. He died in 1945 at age 64 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, having quit his homeland in disgust at the government's close ties with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` We have no doubt that he belongs to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' the composer's son, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Homosassa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, told the concert audience Attending were <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>, Foreign Office minister of state representing the British govrnment, and Hungarian Ambassador <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Domokos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 78, who lives in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the Hungarian capital, are accompanying their father's remains from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` It was difficult for a long time for us to accept that his grave should be disturbed, but finally we knew if we did not, the opportunity to go home with our father wo n't always exist, and the thought of not going with him we could not accept,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> said. Two works of <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> were performed at the concert. Violinist <PERSON> Gyorgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauk </PERSON> and pianist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankl </PERSON>, both Budapest-born and living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, presented the Sonata No. 2 for violin and piano, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> String </PERSON> <PERSON> Quartet </PERSON> played the String Quartet No 6. Quartet violinist <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Birks </PERSON>, asked later if <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>'s music is difficult to play, replied: `` Very _ you have to know it.'' On the platform was a painting of <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> and violinist <PERSON> Yehudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Menuhin </PERSON>, for whom the composer wrote his Sonata for Solo Violin in 1943. Hungarian artist <PERSON> Zsuzsi </PERSON> <PERSON> Roboz </PERSON>, a British resident, presented her picture to the <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> brothers for their father's old home in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, now a memorial museum. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON> said his father's bones were in the simple, zinc-lined box that rested on the Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> 2 overnight and that the box would be buried as it was. `` We thought of having an elaborate casket but the thought of all the disturbance was repugnant to my brother and I,'' he said. He said `` someone cheated'' the family and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Authors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, which arranged the funeral in 1945. `` We ordered a steel coffin because we were all sure that our father would one day go home. But when we exhumed him in <LOCATION> Ferncliff </LOCATION> cemetery -LRB- June 22 -RRB- we found the coffin was wood which had disintegrated,'' the younger brother said.

<HEAD>Report: Ford Offers Settlement In Fatal Church Bus Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has offered out-of-court settlements of less than $ 1 million to each of the families of the 24 children killed in a fiery May 14 church bus crash, a newspaper reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which made the bus chassis, also offered payments to the estates of the three adults who died in the accident near <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, and to the 40 survivors, based on the severity of their injuries, The <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today, attributing the information to unidentified lawyers. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> told the newspaper that `` delicate'' negotiations were under way, but would not comment on whether a settlement had been offered. Lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, who represents the families of two of the dead children, said a settlement was being offered by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and all manufacturers responsible for producing the bus, including <ORGANIZATION> Sheller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which assembled it. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> declined to disclose the size of the offers, but described them as `` attractive financially'' to the families and also a good deal for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sheller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman did not return phone calls seeking comment, the newspaper reported. Lawyer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeeters </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Radcliff firm of <ORGANIZATION> Skeeters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, which is representing most of the remaining plaintiffs, refused to confirm or deny that an offer had been made. Lawyers who have handled similar cases told the <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> it would be highly unusual, if not unprecedented, for such a major case to be settled so quickly, before lawsuits were even filed. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coale </PERSON>, who represents one family and has been active in several air-disaster cases, said it would be `` unconscionable'' to settle so quickly without exploring whether <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> might be liable for punitive damages. He predicted the cases might be worth as much as $ 120 million. <PERSON> Coale </PERSON>, who represents the parents of <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fair </PERSON>, who was killed in the crash, said his client intended to take <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> to trial even if all other plaintiffs settle out of court, although he acknowledged it would be difficult for one client to finance such a battle. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> said he would present the bus makers' proposal today to his clients, the parents of <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunnallee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>. In <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>'s view, the families must decide between accepting the offers, which he called `` a sure thing,'' or the `` reality of fighting one of the largest corporations in the nation for four or five years.'' While he described the offers as attractive, he said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> might be forced to pay $ 60 million to $ 70 million for compensatory damages alone if the case is tried. The total value of the proposed settlement offer is `` nowhere close to that,'' he said. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> also said his clients, whom he described as more interested in bus-safety reforms than money, also might refuse to accept <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s stipulation that settlement values be kept secret. The converted school bus, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was returning 67 people _ mostly children _ to the church after a day at the <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> amusement park near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. Police say the accident was caused by a drunken driver traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71. However, investigators have said other factors combined to increase the loss of life, including the bus' lone rear exit door and crowded conditions inside. Authorities also cited the bus' gas tank, which ruptured and burst into flames. The resulting smoke was blamed for all 27 deaths. The bus was apparently one of the last manufactured in 1977 before a new federal rule required bus fuel tanks be sheathed in protective cages.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s foreign minister today acknowledged that his country had used chemical weapons in its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> was asked at a news conference about Iranian allegations that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had used the deadly weapons against its Persian Gulf War foe. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report says both sides have used them. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> started its use. We were victims many times, since the early beginning of the conflict,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said. Asked whether both his country and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had used such weapons, he replied: `` Both sides.'' It was the first direct admission by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that it has used chemical weapons in its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has condemned the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, and their general use is outlawed by international agreement. On April 25, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said there was evidence that both sides were using chemical weapons in the 7 -LCB- - year-old war The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief had sent a physician from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to visit both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and examine victims of alleged chemical attacks. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> repeated assertions that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> started the war by invading <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and that his country had the right to choose the means for its defense. `` Every nation has the right to protect itself against invasion,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> defended his country's use of chemical weapons in the war, saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was a `` great threat'' to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` There are different views on this matter from different angles. You are living on a civilized continent. You are living on a peaceful continent,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told Western reporters. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> killed 5,000 people, mostly Iraqi Kurds, in a mustard gas and cyanide attack on the Iranian-held <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in March. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not deny the charge then and said it would use all necessary means to repel Iranian forces. It also accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> accused Iran of not only using chemical weapons, but also of violating international accords on the treatment of war prisoners. `` Lately 7,000 Iraqi prisoners of war disappeared. We do n't yet know what their destiny is,'' said <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. `` When we want peace, we have to respect all conventions. But you can not say I'm going to respect all these conventions and give the other side the liberty not to respect them,'' he added. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> did not say when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last used chemical weapons in its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> also said that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s recent war successes do not mean that his country has changed its position of wanting to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. On May 9, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemned the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and called on both sides to refrain from future use of the weapons. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has pushed for <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemnation of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using chemical weapons. Diplomats said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was displeased that the resolution did not single out <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

 Procedures to warn the sex or drug-sharing partners of people infected with AIDS virus are now under way in every state, according to a new report from the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that all 50 states encourage partner notification, through programs by which infected people are urged to inform partners with whom they have had sex or shared needles. Forty-eight states have in place `` referral on request'' programs to inform partners when an AIDS-infected patient asks them to. The other two _ <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> _ have programs to inform partners in certain case, such as women of childbearing age or rape victims. In addition, a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law going into effect today specifies that health authorities may contact spouses, sex partners or other parties for disclosure purposes after first trying to inform the patient that they plan to do so. AIDS, caused by a virus, is transmitted chiefly through sex or contaminated drug needles. Partner notification, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> noted, has been a key part of efforts to fight sexually transmitted diseases since the advent of penicillin to treat syphilis in the 1940s. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommends that AIDS-infected people `` should be instructed in how to notify their partners and to refer them for counseling and testing.'' The agency also recommends that if infected people can not or will not get their partners to seek counseling, `` physicians or health department personnel should use confidential procedures to assure that the partners are notified.'' `` All the states are giving counseling to patients about the need to inform their sex partners and needle-sharing partners,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Toomey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher. Having a third party notify people at risk `` has been shown to be effective, but costly,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. Because of limits on money and other resources, having patients inform their own partners `` has played an increasingly important role.'' In four of the states offering outside notification of sex or drug partners _ <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> _ the percentage of partners identified through the programs who agreed to AIDS tests and showed signs of infection ranged from 14 to 39 percent, Ms. <PERSON> Toomey </PERSON> said. `` By identifying such individuals, the partner-notification process can target risk-reduction messages to those at greatest risk of acquiring or transmitting infection,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. More than 65,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; 88 percent have occurred among homosexual males or injectible drug abusers, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. More than 37,000 patients have already died.

<TEXT>
 The suspect in the country's only known fatal kidnap case said today he picked his victim, a Dutch tycoon, at random and then spent two months planning the abduction. <PERSON> Ferdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON>, 45, said at his trial here that he began mapping out the abduction of grocery baron <PERSON> Gerrit-Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> in July 1987. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> was kidnapped Sept. 9, and his body was found April 4. <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> said he chose his victim at random. His lawyer, <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Weermeijer </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> `` knew Mr. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> from the telephone directory.'' There was no immediate word on the motive for the abduction. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s relatives paid $ 8 million ransom. The only other testimony scheduled to be given was that of a forensic psychiatrist who has examined the suspect extensively. Under Dutch trial practice, the hearing of witnesses is unusual. <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> has confessed that he abducted and killed <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Local press reports indicated that the psychiatric report claimed that at the time of the abduction, <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> bore only `` limited responsibility'' for his deeds. If the court accepted that claim, it could impose a limited jail sentence followed by confinement in an institution for the criminally insane. The soft-spoken <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> is an unemployed business consultant with an engineering degree from a Dutch university. <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> told court president Ms. C.A. <PERSON> Terwee-Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Holten </PERSON> that he shot and killed <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> on the day of his kidnapping in a forest near <LOCATION> Renkum </LOCATION>, in the eastern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>, vice president of the multimillion-dollar <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION> retail concern, was abducted from his sprawling villa in <LOCATION> Bloemendaal </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION>'s affluent suburbs, while on his way to a dental appointment. On April 4, <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s body was dug up from a forest in the eastern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> after police arrested <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON>. Their arrest came after a bank employee discovered a 250-gilder note from the ransom payment.

<TEXT>
 Five Soviet teams will arrive in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> tonight to begin inspections intended to verify compliance with the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty. The Soviet government notified the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early today that the five teams will land in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> at 8 p.m. PDT, said <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Pease </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agency working with the Soviets. Under the treaty, the Soviets need not list the sites they want to visit until they have been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 48 hours, <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. Other Soviets inspectors will inspect sites in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but their arrival time has not been relayed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> annouced Thursday that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team would arrive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this afternoon to begin inspections of Soviet facilities. The teams have 60 days to carry out the `` baseline inspections,'' designed to verify the exact number of missiles and related components to be destroyed under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit Dec. 9. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team will be headed by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Under the terms of the treaty, the two sides must give each other 16 hours' notice of their intent to make an inspection. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team had not given notice of the exact sites to be inspected, preferring to wait as late as possible, <PERSON> Pease </PERSON> said. In addition to the short-notice spot inspections, the INF treaty allows the Soviets to station up to 30 inspectors for the next 13 years in <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, site of Hercules Plant No. 1, where medium-range American missiles were produced. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, in turn, has the right to station inspectors near a Soviet missile-producing site, the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant. The treaty, the first to allow such on-site inspection, is viewed as a trial for the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reduction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, which would slash arsenals of long-range superpower nuclear weapons by 30-50 percent, and involve much more complicated verification procedures.

 Roman Catholic bishops are urging supporters of excommunicated traditionalist Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> to affirm their loyalty to the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and remain united with the church. On Thursday in <LOCATION> Econe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> defied the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and consecrated four bishops of his <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternity </ORGANIZATION>, declaring that the church had become corrupted with modernism. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> denounced the rebel prelate for provoking the first schism in 118 years and declared <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and the bishops expelled from the church. The <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> will announce its position on the priests and lay supporters of <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> in the coming days, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said today. Under church doctrine, <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> will always be a bishop since he was appointed as a successor to the Apostles, said a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> has estimated <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s supporters at 80,000 to 100,000. But other <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials say around half a million people turn to his priests for various church functions, and <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> says he has millions of sympathizers. `` Those who are sympathetic to Archbishop <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and may have found it almost impossible to accept the renewal of the church life endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> are now faced with a painful choice,'' said <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Westminister </LOCATION>. `` I would urge them to reaffirm their loyalty to the successor of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION> and to remain within the unity of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` To continue in support of the archbishop and to worship with the fraternity of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> X </ORGANIZATION> is to leave the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials were visibly angered by the consecrations. A concert scheduled Thursday evening at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> was canceled to express `` deep pain'' over the schism. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> rejected a last-minute appeal by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> before elevating the bishops. Less than two hours later, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said the five had excommunicated themselves by defying papal authority. An excommunicated Roman Catholic is unable to receive the church's sacraments, which include the eucharist and last rites, also known as the sacrament of the sick. A Vatican statement said the consecrations were a `` formally schismatic act.'' A schism is a formal rupture with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s act provoked the first major split in the church since the Old Catholics broke with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> proclaimed the doctrine of papal infallibility in 1870. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> identified those excommunicated as <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and the four bishops: <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fellay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tissier </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallerais </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Galarreta </PERSON>. Reports from <PERSON> Econe </PERSON> said Brazilian prelate <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, bishop of <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, assisted at the rites and also faced excommunication. But <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> was awaiting clarification on his role in the ceremony. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, an 82-year-old Frenchman, called the sanctions `` null and void'' and told his supporters not to pay any attention to them. He said canon law permits his actions `` in a state of emergency.'' He contended in his homily that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, not he, was on a `` schismatic course'' because it accepted `` errors once condemned'' that were leading to the destruction of the church. <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> and his followers reject many of the modernizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65, including openings to other religions and Christian denominations. Interviewed at random, people in <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s audience, estimated by organizers at almost 10,000, all said the sanctions left them unshaken in their loyalty to the tradionalist faith. But the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> expects that many will have second thoughts. Appeals are being readied by the Swiss, French, and West German conferences of bishops, exhorting <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s followers to reject a man who now is barred from receiving the sacraments. The Italian <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement expressing its sorrow and saying the bishops and the church in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> shared in the suffering of the pope. But public opinion polls conducted in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the past few years seem to support <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s claim that the tradionalist movement has millions of sympathizers. Most favor restoration of the 16th Tridentine Mass in Latin which was replaced by the Mass in local modern languages, termed by <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> a `` bastard rite.'' Despite a ban issued 12 years ago that suspended him from his priestly functions, <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> has ordained 220 priests who are officiating in 28 countries. He likes to compare the growth with the decline in ordinations in the official church. The fraternity has seminaries in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, with more being planned in <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It claims to have chapels or centers throughout the world, including a floating chapel anchored in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman died today from a bullet wound she sustained six weeks ago when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers raided her village in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>, 24, was shot in the head during a May 18 army raid on the mountain village of <LOCATION> Abwein </LOCATION>, officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said Her death brought to 214 the number of Palestinians killed since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis also have been killed. Also today, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials rejected army claims that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabello </PERSON>, a 36-year-old street vendor from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, died of a heart attack unrelated to a clash with troops. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Shabello </PERSON> died minutes after inhaling tear gas hurled by troops to subdue stone-throwing demonstrators in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> on Thursday. Shabello's death, which was not included in the fatality count, touched off a violent protest at the man's funeral Thursday, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops wounded one Arab during the clashes. Palestinian protesters are challenging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s rule in the occupied territories and <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which the Israelis seized in the 1967 Middle East War. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a ruling published today, said procedures for detaining Palestinians without trial for up to six months must be formalized. Human rights activists have deplored current policy under which about 2,500 Palestinians are detained. A <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> report today blamed the uprising for diplomatic setbacks in relations with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The newspaper said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had canceled plans to raise the level of relations with <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> reneged on a promise to open an embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and upgrade <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> representation in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deteriorating image also prompted <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> not to open an embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to refuse to host a resident <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting sources in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> said several months ago it would not open an embassy because of the uprising. But he said it was unclear whether the other countries were acting because of the Arab rebellion. He spoke on condition of anonymity. In other developments, police closed the <ORGANIZATION> Dar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aytam </ORGANIZATION> boys' school inside the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Thursday after students from the school stoned a police patrol Two youths were detained, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The school closing came as violence has been on the increase in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after four months of relative calm. In a leaflet issued last week, underground leaders of the uprising called on Arabs to make <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> the focus of their disturbances. The army has also confirmed that 38 schools were closed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in an effort to quell the protests, mostly involving young Palestinians. On Thursday, police fired tear gas at dozens of Palestinians who gathered near a key highway in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to stone Israeli cars, capping a day of violence in the city, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. It said police used tear gas after the Arab youths stoned Israeli cars on a highway linking the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement of Maaleh Adumim, home to over 15,000 Jews, with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The radio did not say whether police made any arrests. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> could not be reached at his home or office for comment on the report. Also Thursday, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states of encouraging Palestinians in the occupied lands to keep up their `` destructive and futile'' actions. He vowed that the uprising would fail. In a speech to leaders of the quasi-governmental <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejected the view that the recent Arab summit in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> adopted moderate resolutions toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> wildlife officials have set traps around this posh ski resort to catch up to eight bears that have been enjoying the city's lifestyle. The bears have been feasting on trash bins, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Andree </PERSON>, a state wildlife official. One of the sows even may have taught her cubs to expect handouts from residents. Earlier this spring, officials believed there was only one bear rambling around town, but recent sightings indicate there could be as many as eight living in a 20-mile stretch from <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beaver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. The bears have become more aggressive, <PERSON> Andree </PERSON> said. Last weekend, a bear chased a 14-year-old boy after he photographed the animal. Residents have been warned not to camp or sleep out in backyards or near food sources. Bears older than 3 years will be killed, <PERSON> Andree </PERSON> said. Younger bears will be marked and released near <LOCATION> Radium </LOCATION>, 20 miles northeast of here. State wildlife officials believe younger bears, if put in the proper habitat, may learn to eat without bothering people.

 The first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inspectors assigned to verify Soviet compliance with the treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons left for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today. Their Soviet counterparts arrive in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> tonight. The two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspection teams, each comprised of 10 experts, traveled from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> Air Base. They were led by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brig </ORGANIZATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lojoie </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which was formed Jan. 15, 1988 after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> treaty in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. That accord eliminated ground-based short - and medium-range missiles `` We all feel this is a historic mission,'' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> told reporters before boarding a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` Its impact on international relations can not be underestimated. We are proud to be a part of this important moment in history.'' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said one team would travel to the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Votkinsk </LOCATION>, the site of a plant that formerly built the Soviets' SS-20 missiles The SS-20s are covered by the treaty, along with <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-built </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 missiles and cruise missiles based in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team must tell the Soviets within 48 hours after arrival where it intends to begin conducting inspections, <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said. He did not disclose which site that would be. `` We're going in with the attitude ` Trust everybody, but always cut the cards,''' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said. The general said that although there are 1,800 missiles whose destruction must be checked, other related items _ including storage and transport missile containers and special hauling vehicles _ bring the actual number of items to be inspected to at least 5,000. The inspection teams will be checking for numbers of missiles, and individual components will be measured and weighed under the inspection process agreed upon with the Soviets, said <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>. In the next two months, the inspectors will visit 126 sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, including 33 in eastern <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said. The Soviets will inspect 26 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including 11 in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> teams include linguists and specialists in nuclear missiles. Although the inspection teams are comprised of members of all branches of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and civilian government employees, the inspection agreement calls for all of them to wear civilian clothes during their stay in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> commander Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said he was confident the verification arrangements would work.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Bill To Strengthen Residential Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government proposed legislation today that would strengthen residential segregation but also would allow creation of the first legal multi-racial neighborhoods. Government opponents condemned the three proposed measures, saying they would force the evictions of thousands of blacks now living peacefully but illegally in `` whites only'' areas. `` The government indicates once again its absolute obsession with skin color as a norm on which to base <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political, social and economic life,'' said the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>, member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called the measures `` so harsh and so brutal'' that up to 200,000 blacks could be evicted on short notice. Under the Group Areas Act, all residential areas are segregated by race. However, thousands of non-whites are living illegally in neighborhoods designated for whites in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and other urban areas. One of the proposed measures, the Group Areas Amendment Bill, would make it easier to confiscate property and to evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race group. The maximum fine for a person living outside his group area would be increased from $ 175 to $ 4,300. The maximum prison sentence would be increased from two years to five years. The government has not strictly enforced the 35-year-old Group Areas Act in recent years, angering conservative whites opposed to integrated neighborhoods. The proposed bill is widely seen as an accommodation to right-wing whites prior to nationwide municipal elections in October. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favors gradual race reform but says it is committed to preserving white `` group rights'' such as segregated schools and neighborhoods. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has dominated South African politics for 40 years but has been losing ground to the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes all concessions to the nation's 26 million black majority. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid, blacks have no vote in national affairs. A second proposed bill, the Free Settlement Areas Bill, would allow creation of residential areas open to all races. But before such areas could be established, a government committee would check `` the necessity or desirability'' of an area being opened to all races. A third bill would set up guidelines for multi-racial political participation by residents in `` open areas.'' The three bills are to be debated in the next session of Parliament in August.

<HEAD>Small `Star Wars' Rocket Engine Successfully Tested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Aerospace experts developing `` Star Wars'' technology have successfully tested a tiny, 2-ounce rocket engine designed to power satellite-based missile killers. The engine tested at <ORGANIZATION> Rocketdyne </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Susana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday is slated for use as a directional thruster for a space-based interceptor in the Strategic Defense Initiative program. The goal is to neutralize incoming enemy nuclear missiles before they re-enter the atmosphere by using lasers and interceptor rockets. The new engine, dubbed by designers as the most efficient in the free world, would guide the interceptor from its base on a satellite toward an approaching nuclear missile. The missile would be destroyed on impact. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Space Division, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rocketdyne </ORGANIZATION> called the test successful, praising the engine's weight-to-thrust ratio, a measure of its power and efficiency. Thrust is the forward force produced in reaction to gases escaping rearward from the engine. `` The engines we were running with around five years ago were 1-to-20,'' said <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunch </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rocketdyne </ORGANIZATION> engineer in the space-based interceptor, or SABIR, program. The tiny engine tested has a weight-to-thrust ratio of 1-to-1 ,200, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Patota </PERSON>, engineer in charge of the test area The engine was fired, or pulsed, for five milliseconds and then was shut off for 1 @ 10 of a second. This cycle was repeated dozens of times during each of the three testings. The result sounded like machine gun fire. The interceptor rockets would be equipped with four of the tested engines and four smaller thrusters.

 Presidential employees will get letters next week telling them they face random drug tests in about 60 days, a step the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said today likely would not have caught five White House drug abusers. Both President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, who has campaigned extensively against drug use, expressed dismay Thursday at the disclosure that two female <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> secretaries had resigned and three <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officers were suspended during a drug probe. `` I think it's just evidence of what we've been saying. ... No one is exempt,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, adding, `` This problem crosses all kinds of lines.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, through her spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, voiced disappointment and said, `` Drugs are everywhere _ in the work place, movie industry, sports fields and college campuses. It's time everyone became involved and aware and intolerant of drug use. Her husband, however, advocated treatment rather than intolerance for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> employees implicated in the case. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said during brief comments to reporters that `` if it's just a case of using'' drugs rather than dealing, `` I would like to see us do our best to get them into a drug treatment organization, and that they will agree to accept a cure. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said urine testing is a serious intrusion of privacy rights. `` The response of the president, which is to line up many dedicated civil servants who have given a good part of their careers to life in public service to pee on command in order to prove their innocence is really not the best way to deal with this problem in the White House,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` In the opinion of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, what happened at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seems to make the case against drug testing because, in fact, these people were caught as the result of a problem that was triggered by somebody's legitimate suspicion,'' she said, adding that if the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had relied on drug testing `` these people may have slipped right through.'' Neither White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> would identify the individuals involved or the illegal substances allegedly used. Published and broadcast reports have said the probe focused on cocaine and marijuana use. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said letters will be sent to the 1,600 presidential employees next week warning that a mandatory, random program of drug testing will commence 60 days hence. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the tests will be conducted six times a year, with each round involving about 2 percent of the staff. Included are employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the offices of the vice president and the first lady. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said two female clerical employees `` admitted drug use and were separated from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>'' several months ago. The spokesman refused to say whether they had sensitive positions on the agency, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> unit that advises the president on a wide gamut of foreign affairs and security issues. Adding to the disconcerting news was the alleged involvement of uniformed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ the men and women who guard the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> grounds, travel with the president to help provide security and protect other key <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> locations such as embassies and the vice president's home. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said none of the allegations involved the non-uniformed <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents who act as the president's bodyguards Snow declined to specify the sex of the uniformed officers involved. He said some 960 officers serve in the uniformed division. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that on July 13, the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will begin its own program of pre-employment drug testing for job applicants. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which first reported the drug investigation and suspensions, quoted an unidentified source as saying that at least one sale of cocaine allegedly occurred on White House property. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that `` we have been advised that drugs were not used or sold on the White House premises.'' Snow would not comment on that, although he did say that no charges had yet been filed. Snow said the three <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officers _ who have <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection _ were placed on administrative leave with pay, and that their status will depend on whether charges are brought by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The officers were placed on leave during the past week, Snow said. The secretaries, who do not have <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> status, lost their positions because they serve at the pleasure of the president, officials said. The disclosure of the drug investigation shook the White House at a time when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` zero-tolerance'' anti-drug abuse campaign is in disarray. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has sought, so far unsuccessfully, to get Democratic congressional leaders to take part in a bipartisan task force on the problem. Moreover, the latest uproar came on a day in which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> received recommendations from his Drug Policy Board, headed by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Among the proposals was one to require companies doing business with the government to demonstrate effective plans for a drug-free workplace. The board also recommended that federal student aid programs be made conditional upon the adoption of effective anti-drug programs by colleges and universities and said students with records of drug offenses should not be given assistance.

<HEAD>Report Says National Security Agency Bugging Satellite Phone Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is investigating allegations that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> engaged in electronic eavesdropping of Congressmen and American citizens, The Plain Dealer reported today. The alleged telephone bugging was accomplished through interception of satellite signals, the newspaper said. It said the allegations surfaced during secret testimony earlier this year by <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON>, 45, a former employee at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Maj. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freitag </PERSON>, public affairs duty officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Thursday night he was not familiar with Ms. <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON> or her allegations and could not comment on the report Ms. <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON>, a former software configuration management analyst for space projects at <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, handled classified assignments overseas and possessed <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> special access clearances. She lost her top secret access after becoming a `` whistleblower'' on waste in a government program and making accusations that she was sexually harassed, according to The Plain Dealer, which said she was fired from <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> for alleged time-card violations. Ms. <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON> told Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, that the monitoring was being done with the cooperation of British authorities and from English soil, the newspaper said. While <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> eavesdropping on ordinary telephone calls is barred in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, loopholes in the law allow the agency to do it by monitoring microwave frequencies outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> borders, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON>, author of `` Puzzle Palace,'' a book on the NSA. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, who is said to have been among those whose personal calls were monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> security agency, said he looked into the allegations after being informed of them by The Plain Dealer. He said he does not believe they are true. Ms. <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON> was among sources confirming the existence of her top-secret session with <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> and two committee staffers, the newspaper said. Asked about the allegations, Ms. <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON>'s credibility or why other members of the committee were not involved in the meeting, <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said, `` I do n't discuss intelligence business.'' The military watchdog group <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procurement </ORGANIZATION> has been working with <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> on the probe, The Plain Dealer said.

 It may have been the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>' biggest victory since they won the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s West Division in 1983 Like a manager trying to spark a late-inning rally, Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> worked the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and coaxed lawmakers to go to bat for the American League club. They responded early today by narrowly approving an incentive package to keep the team from moving to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` This is a political resurrection from the dead, a baseball resurrection from the dead,'' a jubilant <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` I even told myself a couple times this was dead. But I decided I was not going to let them go.'' The deal would tie the team's rent on the new $ 150 million state-financed stadium to attendance and give the state a share of the team's gate receipts, television royalties and other revenue when attendance tops 1.2 million. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> are elated at the outcome of -LRB- the -RRB- stadium vote,'' the team said in a statement. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, officials who tried to lure the team south conceded defeat. `` It was clearly their turn at bat and they hit a homer,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>, the assistant city manager who led the negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're obviously very disappointed about the vote in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.'' Final passage came on a tense 60-55 vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as time ran out on the last regularly scheduled day of the 1988 session. A short time earlier, the package cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a 30-26 vote. The city is also home to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>, a National League team.

<TEXT>
 A mountain-sized asteroid smashed into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> 2.3 million years ago and exploded with a force of 12 billion tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, sending so much water vapor aloft that it could have helped accelerate the last ice age, scientists reported today. A study published in the journal Science says the asteroid, more than a quarter-mile across and weighing more than 6 trillion pounds, hit the ocean just southwest of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, and splashed billions of tons of water vapor into the upper stratosphere. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyte </PERSON>, a member of the research team at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the asteroid actually could have been much larger than a quarter-mile across, but researchers can confirm only a minimum size. <PERSON> Kyte </PERSON> and his colleagues, <PERSON> Lei </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, calculated the size of the asteroid by studying the composition and distribution of core samples taken from six sites on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> floor. He said the researchers were able to identify some of the samples as unmelted asteroid material heavily laced with salt. Other samples had metal grains, and all were rich in iridium, a chemical characteristic of meteorites. <PERSON> Kyte </PERSON> said the asteroid would have hit the ocean at about 12,000 miles an hour. The energy of the mass and velocity would instantly have been converted into an explosion that would have blasted water aloft and vaporized most of the asteroid, he said. `` It would have made any atomic bomb look like a toy,'' <PERSON> Kyte </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. The explosion would have equaled the force of 12 billion tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bomb dropped on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> in 1945 had a force of 19,000 ton of TNT. In what he said is strictly speculation, <PERSON> Kyte </PERSON> said tons of water vapor sent into the upper stratosphere by the blast could have formed clouds that reflected sunlight away from the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. This, he said, could have been sufficient to cause a rapid decrease in global temperature and an increase within a season in the amount of land covered by snow. <PERSON> Kyte </PERSON> said the asteroid hit the ocean about the time that the last great glacier age started about 2.3 million years ago. But he said he and his coauthors are not claiming that the asteroid triggered the glacier age _ only that the two events occurred about the same time and that the asteroid impact may have contributed to the cooling. Most scientists believe the glacial age, which lasted until about 10,000 years ago, was brought about by a gradual global cooling, perhaps triggered by a movement of the continents that blocked the exchange of warm water between oceans at the equator. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasting </PERSON>, an impact expert at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said he regarded as `` highly speculative'' the theory that the asteroid impact could have added to the global cooling. <PERSON> Kasting </PERSON> said some studies have indicated that clouds, formed in the upper stratosphere by water splashed aloft by an impact, could actually contribute to warming the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by allowing sunlight to pass through and then trapping heat reflected from the planet surface. `` The clouds could warm or cool the planet, depending on their thickness,'' he said.

 `` The Greatest Show On Earth'' met one of the world's most polite audiences today, and the American brand of unbridled circus won some new fans. The Ringling Bros. and <ORGANIZATION> Barnum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shows </ORGANIZATION> made its debut in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in a huge tent in this city on the northern island of Hokkaido. The audience was the first in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to see an American circus. A near-capacity matinee crowd of about 4,000 attended the debut and clapped enthusiastically for the 200-member troupe, after a little encouragement from the clowns. `` We had been prepared for a reserved, quiet crowd. This is not <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' ringmaster <PERSON> Dinny </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> after the performance. `` But they clapped fervently. ... I did not expect them to be as overwhelmingly demonstrative.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ringling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> has brought a version of the 118-year-old show to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as an experiment. It will give 44 performances in <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION>, then 96 shows in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in August and September. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the local promoter of the tour, wanted a production as big as the two Ringling troupes touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said publicist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>. The $ 40 ticket price for adults _ about four times the average price in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ still is considered reasonably priced entertainment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. To help audiences understand the acts, ringmaster <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> learned his introductions in Japanese. Also, Japanese characters were put on many of the clown costumes to identify them to children. Finally, `` we brought in 120 kids last week'' for a dry run, <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> said. Ringling owner-producer <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> said the production will cost $ 10 million plus incidentals _ such as the $ 8 million tent. At the matinee, viewers first smiled instead of laughing and clapped politely instead of loudly. But the clowns went into the stands for direct contact with youngsters, then staged elaborate stunts and broke the ice with a comedy high-wire act called the `` Mount Fuji Aerial Adventure.'' `` Slapstick always plays well,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, the head clown, wearing a blue wig. <PERSON> Sachiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Okawara </PERSON> said she liked the performance `` very much.'' `` The performancers, the animals, the costumes, the lights _ and the band. The band was beautiful,'' she said. For 5-year-old <PERSON> Miku </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusakabo </PERSON>, the list of favorites was shorter: `` The elephants,'' she said through an interpreter, and nodded vigorously when asked if she wanted to come back.

Now the late comedian has been honored with the <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> Bus Depot. The Great One's widow, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, was on hand Thursday at the dedication of the depot in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, the borough of his birth and the setting for `` The Honeymooners,'' the show on which he created the <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON> character.

He was, as he always said of -LRB- his wife -RRB- <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, the greatest.'' About 1,200 people witnessed the dedication at the 919,000-square-foot building that employs 850 people.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prosecution witness has written President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to seek clemency for six black people whose death sentences have sparked international outrage, a newspaper reported today. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Manete </PERSON>, who said that police tortured him so he would give false testimony, reportedly described his police interrogation and pleaded for the release of the so-called <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six. `` I am writing this letter in order to tell you the truth ... What I have told the court was not my words,'' according to a text of the letter published today by <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the largest circulation newspaper for blacks. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> refused to intervene in the case, despite appeals from many foreign governments to halt the hanging of the five black men and one woman convicted of the mob killing of a black town councillor. A day before they were due to hang in March, attorneys obtained a stay of execution from the trial judge, <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Human </PERSON>, on the basis of a statement that <PERSON> Manete </PERSON> had given his lawyer. The lawyers said <PERSON> Manete </PERSON> wrote an affidavit saying police coerced him into falsely identifying two of the defendants as being part of the crowd that stoned and burned ouncilor <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> in September 1984. During a hearing last month, <PERSON> Human </PERSON> said he had not relied on <PERSON> Manete </PERSON>'s testimony and had not been shown the affidavit. Human said reopening the case to investigate interrogation of other prosecution witnesses would be `` absurd.'' Human gave the defendants until July 19 to seek a stay of execution from the chief justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rabie </PERSON>. In the letter printed today, <PERSON> Manete </PERSON> described his interrogation, saying that from the outset he told police he did n't know the names of <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s killers. `` They threatened and pressurized me,'' he wrote. `` One of the white policemen pushed my head against the wall and I was clapped several times on the face.'' He said a policeman read him the names of the six defendants and told him he would be imprisoned `` and tortured daily'' if he did not name two of them as having been present at the killing. Finally, <PERSON> Manete </PERSON> said, `` I agreed with them.'' `` During the interrogation I was afraid that very soon I will reach the point of no return _ that is death,'' he said. The six defendants are <PERSON> Mohalefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefatsa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Diniso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramashomola </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duma </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokgesi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manete </PERSON> said he was told to identify <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mokgesi </PERSON>. He told <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> other prosecution witnesses also were unhappy about statements they had given under police interrogation.

 When the lights flickered inside the <ORGANIZATION> Cheyenne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the last call sounded for 19 - and 20-year-olds enjoying their last night of legal drinking in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> until they turn 21 The flickering marked midnight, the witching hour for those working to make the most of the time before the state joined the rest of the nation in making 21 the minimum legal drinking age at 12:01 a.m. today. `` I think everybody has one last chance and they are taking advantage of it,'' said 20-year-old <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Wileman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>. `` I kind of have to, because I ca n't go back in and drink for the next 10 months.'' The clock on <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s alcohol drinking age began ticking in March, when Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and legislators reluctantly agreed they could no longer hold out against `` federal blackmail'' _ the withholding of federal highway funds because the state had not raised its drinking age. After singing along to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beastie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>' `` You Got ta Fight For Your Right To Party,'' the shoulder-to-shoulder crowd moved toward the doors, waving to a network television crew and carrying a young woman on their shoulders. Some went home; others waited outside for the bar to re-open and serve non-alcoholic drinks to those under 21. Those affected by the law were almost unanimously against it. `` What bothers me is <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> is recognized as the equality state,'' said <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` If we are the equality state and the first to take chances on things like women voting, we should take a chance on taking a stand.'' `` My husband is 21, so I like to go to the bar with him,'' said 19-year-old <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>. `` For a year, we've been coming to this bar together. All of a sudden, they say to me ` He's responsible, but you're not any more. You ca n't do that.'' Under the law passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, states had to raise the drinking age to 21 or lose a percentage of their federal highway funds. The law went into effect in 1986, and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> sacrificed $ 11.8 million in two years. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> stood to lose another $ 8.2 million in federal funds if the drinking age increase was not in place by today. <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> officials said the state could have lost $ 41.3 million in highway funds during the next four years. The reasoning behind the move made little difference to many of those out Thursday night, such as <PERSON> Dianna </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, who celebrated her 19th birthday in <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION> with a few last drinks. `` I do n't live with my parents,'' she said. `` I make my own decisions. If I can do all of that, I can drink responsibly.''

 Two cars rigged with explosives blew up today in separate parts of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, killing at least one person and injuring 52, police said. The first explosion occurred on west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s busiest street. A police spokesman said the bomb went off on <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> at about 11:50 a.m. -LRB- 4:50 a.m. EDT -RRB- near the Grand Hotel in the Syrian-policed neighborhood. The spokesman, who could not be identified in line with standing regulations, could not immediately confirm a state radio report that a man killed in the blast was the driver of the automobile. Thirty-two people were injured in that bombing. Later, a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> loaded with explosives blew up in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley near a Syrian army checkpoint, police said. They said 20 people, including two <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> soldiers, were injured. The car, parked about 15 yards from a checkpoint in the town of <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elias </LOCATION>, exploded at 12:25 p.m. and set four other cars on fire, police said. After the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> bombing, black smoke billowed from the southern edge of <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> as motorists, honking their horns, sped away in panic. The street is lined with boutiques, cafes and other shops. Its high-rise buildings house offices and banks. The explosion occurred near the plush <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cinema </LOCATION>, which was closed because of damage sustained in civil war fighting. Witnesses said Syrian soldiers fired automatic rifles in the air to make way for fleeing cars. Lebanese policemen blocked traffic along the 1.5-mile-long street to allow ambulances and fire engines to reach the scene. Today's blasts came nine days after a car bomb exploded in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian district of <LOCATION> Karantina </LOCATION>, wounding 19 people. There have been nine car bombings in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Ninety-four people were killed and 251 wounded in the previous blasts.

 A World War II veteran plans to fly solo across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to return to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> battlefield where a sniper's bullet left him a paraplegic 43 years ago, and West German officials are waiting to honor him <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 63, a real estate company owner and bank chairman in suburban <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, took off at about 9:30 a.m. today from <LOCATION> DeKalb-Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in a single-engine Cherokee Piper equipped with hand controls and an extra gas tank. `` What scares me the most is rolling around in this wheelchair and getting in and out of it,'' he said. `` The easy part is the flying. Once I get on the ground, that's the hard part.'' The residents of <LOCATION> Stolberg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, will be celebrating what city manager <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> called <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s `` spirit of enterprise and courage'' as he completes a 4,669-mile solo trans-Atlantic flight via <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The reception at Stolberg's historic castle is scheduled for July 11, the day <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> hopes, weather permitting, to arrive at the nearby airport in <LOCATION> Aachen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> flies in a cramped two-seat cockpit filled with his wheelchair, his luggage, a life raft, survival kit and an auxiliary fuel tank. He gets in and out of the plane by crawling onto the wing, which sits about three feet off the ground, and then pulling the wheelchair up or letting it down with a strap. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, a founding director of the <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, hopes his trip will raise enough money for a Center for Independent Living at the hospital to help the newly paralyzed learn to care for themselves. Supporters are pledging to the hospital up to $ 1 for each of the 4,669 miles he plans to cover. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who has already flown solo to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and back, says flying alone has great attraction for someone for whom more routine tasks can be difficult. `` When I was a kid and I first got shot,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said, recalling his days as a 20-year-old infantryman, `` I was in a hospital for a year and a half. They did n't know what to do with us. We were just invalids. When that happens when you're young, you miss out on a lot. So, when you have a chance to transport yourself over great distances, it has a lot of appeal.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> had planned to be a pilot in World War II because he thought it would be glamorous. But he was assigned to the infantry and joined the 104th Division for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s push into <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after D-Day. Four days after he arrived, he was shot by a sniper on the battlefield near <LOCATION> Stolberg </LOCATION> he plans to visit. A friend dragged him to a nearby farmhouse. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who finally learned to fly until age 55, plans to guide his `` Spirit of Shepherd'' plane up the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and across <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base at <LOCATION> Sondrestrom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, where he will spend July 4. Flying by visual flight rules about 2,000 feet above the ground, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> then will cross the <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> ice cap and go on to <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Bagar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Faeroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Stornoway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Biggin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Aachen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The pilot said he might sell his plane in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and plans to take a commercial flight home after a 10-day visit. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said he's making the journey `` for me, for all paraplegics, for everyone who feels trapped by their bodies.'' He hopes the trip will inspire paralyzed people `` so when they think they'll never be able to do anything, they'll remember that this guy did that.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with a grinning <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> standing by, indicated today he does not think talk that <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> is `` dull and boring'' and ran a disastrous presidential campaign four years ago should disqualify the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> senator from the vice presidency. `` Dull and boring? I kind of like that,'' said the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be, who himself has been accused of failing to excite audiences. As for the criticism of <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s failed 1984 effort to become the Democratic presidential nominee, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I've won campaigns and I've lost campaigns. I've run good campaigns and have had one disastrous campaign, so I'm very sympathetic.'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> appeared with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union hall, the final stop on a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> campaign swing by the governor. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> emphasized economic and family issues in his speeches, much of the attention was diverted to his continuing search for a running mate. During a stop Thursday night in Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was joined on stage by Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, one of several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> mentioned as potential vice-presidential choices. Monday night, back home in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife will have dinner with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s wife _ a meal certain to include discussion of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination, which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he deserves to be offered. `` I think part of that will be discussed at some point,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitropoulos </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> hall today, there was no question who was the crowd favorite for a spot on the Democratic ticket. `` I've been taking a poll all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> about running mates. What do you think about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked the union audience. The response was loud applause and whistles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned and shook <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s hand, then turning back to the microphone, said, `` Sounds unanimous to me.'' Later, when he opened the event to questions from the audience, 14-year-old <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> asked him who his vice-presidential choice would be. `` Who do you like?'' asked the candidate. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>,'' she replied. `` I'm grateful for your advice and counsel,'' he said. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, who became a national hero when as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> pilot and astronaut he became the first American to orbit <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, has served on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and now on the Armed Services panel. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as a freshman congressman in 1965, now is second in line behind Chairman <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> and is seen as likely to come into the chairmanship eventually. After the 1984 election, he was picked to chair the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Much of the speculation about the sort of running mate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should choose has centered on the need for someone with experience dealing with foreign policy and defense issues. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has repeatedly cited his own qualifications for the vice presidential nomination, beginning with his finish second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the race for the top spot on the ticket. But while saying his strong showing in the primaries and caucuses earned him the right to consideration for a place on the ticket, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not said whether he actually would accept it if offered. Recently the former civil rights activist said he had made his decision, but he refused to disclose it, even to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Their upcoming dinner might offer him the opportunity to do that. <PERSON> Mitropoulos </PERSON> said it was during a flight Wednesday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he'd like to invite <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, to have a holiday dinner with him and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, at their <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, home. Nobody could say who would do the cooking or what the menu might be. There also was a possibility they would go to the <ORGANIZATION> Hatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> on the shore of the <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for the annual holiday concert by the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pops </LOCATION> orchestra. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, is a former associate conductor of the Pops. Throughout all the speculation about the vice presidency, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remained adamant about making his decision on his timetable. `` I have the luxury of having the time and being able to do this thoughtfully and deliberately,'' he told reporters at an aluminum company plant outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I'm not going to hurry it,'' he said. `` I'll make a decision when I'm ready to make a decision.''

<TEXT>
 Human error and design flaws contributed to the collision of two Army helicopters that killed 17 soldiers during night training at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, according to a report released today. `` Human error-pilot error is presumed to be the cause of this mishap,'' said the report released at a news conference. But the report added, `` Because the accident was fatal to the crew of both aircraft, it is impossible to determine exactly what caused the two aircraft to fly into each other.'' The report said one of the two UH-60 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> did not have its anti-collision strobe turned on as required at the time of the March 8 accident. The report also cited other factors, including limited pilot training using night-vision goggles and exterior and interior design flaws of the Black Hawk. The report said there was no evidence of a mechanical malfunction. `` There should be no action taken against anyone as no foundation for negligence can be established,'' the report said. `` The accident was not due to lack of diligence, nor unreasonable or unprofessional conduct.'' The accident occurred when a Black Hawk returning from a solo instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in a formation of three returning from a mission to pick up soldiers in the field. The lead helicopter, struck broadside, carried 13 soldiers; the other craft carried four. All were killed. The other two helicopters were not damaged and landed safely. The 17 victims belonged to the 101st Airborne Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>. The investigation concluded the collision `` was the result of the two air crews' being unable to see each other in the final moments of flight,'' according to a statement read by Maj. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON>, public-affairs officer at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>. `` Restrictions to vision caused by door posts and structural components of the aircraft and the limited field of view of the night vision goggles being used by both crews hampered their ability to see and avoid each,'' <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. The lights on the helicopter leading the formation could `` very easily have been obscured and blended into'' city lights, <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. Crew members on the undamaged helicopters said there was little warning that another helicopter was approaching. `` Up to the point of impact, the missions were formed just as briefed,'' <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Shockney </PERSON>, pilot of the third helicopter, told investigators the lone helicopter did not have its anti-collision strobe on. The strobe is attached to the front of the Black Hawk. `` That is the one thing that really catches your eyes under goggles,'' he said. `` If he would have had his anti-collision light on, we would have seen him for miles and miles.'' Investigators theorize the crew forgot to turn the anti-collision strobe light on after a fuel stop, the report said. Compounding the problem, the report said, was the lack of lighting on the helicopters. The report said the number and size of position lights on the outside of the $ 4.6 million Black Hawk are inadequate. Moreover, the pilot and co-pilot of the incoming helicopter could have been tired, the report said.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Sugar Cane Workers Opportunity to Qualify for Resident
Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has given thousands of foreign sugar cane workers an opportunity to qualify for permanent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident status under a program for seasonal farm workers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to accept applications from sugar cane workers to obtain legal resident status under streamlined procedures to accommodate a Nov. 1 deadline. Under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, seasonal workers have that date to file applications to qualify for the program. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> also ordered <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to grant work authorization papers to the applicants and barred the agency from initiating deportation proceedings against those individuals. `` Equity demands that these sugar cane workers be afforded an opportunity to stay in the country pending the final outcome regarding the status of sugar cane'' in the program for seasonal workers, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>, who ruled in April that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had not justified excluding sugar cane harvesters from the program, chided <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> for the continuing delay in drafting new regulations. He gave <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> until July 11 to propose the new regulations and set an August 19 deadline for issuing the final rule. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> could still issue regulations that exclude sugar cane harvesters from the program, but the agency would have to give <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> further justification for its decision. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had sought to issue its new regulations in September, but <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said further delays would not give the workers enough time to qualify for legal status if the department ultimately decided they could participate in the program. `` The court views with skepticism ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- claims that, despite at least three drafts which have been rejected, the agency still is grappling with the drafting of the regulation,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a veteran political manager who engineered President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s early <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> political triumphs, has died at age 63. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a major figure in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> politics for more than three decades, died Thursday of heart failure, said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, an associate in his political consulting firm.

<HEAD>Japanese Officials Investigates Kidney Transplants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is investigating reports that Filipino donors were paid to give up a kidney for Japanese patients willing to pay the price, an official said today. The Health and Welfare Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ministry started the investigation after reports that a Filipino prison inmate was paid to donate a kidney to a 51-year-old Japanese man in June. `` Our position is that the sale of kidneys by unrelated living donors is undesirable and at this point we are trying to confirm those reports,'' the official said. A person can live with one healthy kidney. The Japanese government is also investigating whether to ask the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to ban such operations there on Japanese citizens, the official said. According to <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON>, executive assistant to <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bengzon </PERSON>, two Japanese citizens have received kidneys in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> in the past month, and both operations were performed at the private Kidney Center of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He said one of the kidneys came from an inmate at a state penitentiary and the other from a Japanese donor. Under Japanese law, patients are allowed to receive kidneys from relatives or from the dead. The use of organs for transplant from brain-dead donors is not recognized in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and liver, pancreas and heart transplants seldom are performed. Arrangements for the two Japanese nationals to undergo transplant operations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> were handled by <PERSON> Tadashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he did not know that the kidney donor was a prison inmate and denied any knowledge of money being paid to the donor or to his family. According to a report released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION>, about 9,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Only an estimated 572 people received kidney transplants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1987, the report said. `` It was a courageous decision by the Filipino doctor to conduct the operation,'' <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said. `` It was an emergency, the patient was dying.'' <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> said he agrees it is unethical to pay donors. He added his non-profit organization, which charges $ 138,000 for 200 days of medical care by a four-member team, lost money on the June case. `` The government here does n't allow transplants from -LRB- unrelated -RRB- living donors, but such operations are legal in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' said an employee of the private <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, another group that refers kidney patients to doctors in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

 Heavy rain soaked the central Plains today, bringing new life to wilting crops and flooding parts of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, but some farmers complained that the wet weather was too little, too late. `` It's too late for this corn even if it does rain,'' said <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> farmer <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Limon </PERSON>, edging into chest-high stalks that should be 3 feet higher by now. The struggling ears were pale; the kernels were widely spaced. `` You can hear it rattle when the wind blows. And that's a bad sign,'' <PERSON> Limon </PERSON> said Thursday hours before scattered rain fell on the state. `` But we're thankful. It could be no ears at all.'' A bill to guarantee up to $ 35 million in loans to help farmers suffering through the drought was passed Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and sent to the governor. It would provide about 3,500 potential loans to farmers whose debts totaled 40 percent of their assets. Maximum loans would be $ 10,000 for up to three years at 6 percent interest. Widespread rain fell Thursday night and early today from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chanute </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, got 2.14 inches in the six hours up to 7 a.m. and 2.02 inches fell at <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. But forecasters cautioned that the drought continues. `` The indications are that this is a temporary interlude,'' said <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, where 3.72 inches fell Wednesday and early Thursday. That city got an additional 1.83 inches today. `` Over the long haul, we expect to return to the dry, hot weather. Ten days from now, people will be needing water again.'' The rain came too late to help the wheat crop, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordquist </PERSON>, crop production specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska-Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> and Extension Center in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION>. One example of the shortfall in precipitation is <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillaker </PERSON>, acting state climatologist, said final statistics for the first six months of the year are expected to show average state rainfall came to 7.45 inches, driest on record, including more than 2 inches earlier this week in some areas. Normal rainfall in that period is 15.72 inches. For some it was not only too late, but too much. Fields, roads and bridges in northeastern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> were under up to 5 feet of water Thursday. The heaviest rain reported was 12 inches in <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>. About 20 <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents had to be evacuated _ some by boat _ because of flooding, county authorities said. `` I knew it was raining when I went to sleep, and when I woke up water was rushing in the front door,'' said resident <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvers </PERSON>. `` I panicked and grabbed everything I could and started yelling at my neighbor across the street to see if she was OK.'' The water washed away large chunks of asphalt from county roads and uprooted fields of crops made fragile by the heat and drought Residents were allowed back in their homes Thursday. Thunderstorms brought cooler temperatures to the Plains and a cold front pushed temperatures to record lows today around the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Elkins, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, got down to a brisk 32 degrees But the heat wave that had gripped the Midwest claimed another victim Thursday. An 80-year-old <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> man died of dehydration three days after he and his wife were found in a wheat field. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> died at a <LOCATION> Cordell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, hospital after attempts to rehydrate him failed, said <LOCATION> Washita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> undersheriff <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazureka </PERSON>. His wife, <PERSON> Rhoda </PERSON>, 77, died earlier after collapsing of heat exhaustion last weekend. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, an autopsy Thursday on a 77-year-old woman found dead in her home revealed she died of heatstroke. The body of <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> was found Wednesday as temperatures in Mobile hovered in the 90s.

<HEAD>Amish Man Sentenced For Safety Sign Violation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRESTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Amish man has been sentenced to seven days in jail, and two dozen others believe they could soon follow, in a long-standing clash between religious beliefs and a state highway safety law. State law requires non-motorized vehicles to have a red-outlined orange reflective triangle mounted on the back to warn approaching drivers. But the Amish say displaying the signs would violate their religion because of their bright color and because they are worldly objects. Amish leaders and state legislators worked out a compromise law two years ago allowing the Amish to use a white-outlined black triangle during the day and the orange sign at night. But the Amish community has divided over the compromise. Some refuse to use the orange sign at night and some, especially older and more conservative Amish, use no signs whatsoever. <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> was one of 24 Amish men and women who appeared Thursday before <ORGANIZATION> Fillmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> was ticketed in October and again in February. He refused to pay a $ 20 fine or perform five hours of community service and was cited for contempt of court. After finding him guilty, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> offered him a choice of a $ 150 fine, doing 30 hours of community service or serving seven days in jail. <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> chose jail. `` What else can a conscientious objector do?'' he asked later. Each of the other defendants pleaded not guilty to violating state law, but then admitted the facts against them were true. The judge found them guilty. `` Religious conviction in this case is not a defense to the charge,'' she told one defendant. Though they were only fined, most of the Amish said they think they'll eventually follow <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> to jail. They have until November to pay fines or perform community service.

<HEAD>Police Move On Disputed Land Squatters, Communist Guards Help Them
Over Wall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police today chased nearly 200 squatters from a disputed piece of land near the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall after a monthlong struggle that pitted environmentalists against city developers. When the removal order came, the squatters found an unusual escape route _ over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> into the city's Communist side. East German border guards helped them over the barrier, which divides the city of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> into Allied and Communist sectors. Most of the estimated 186 environmentalists who fled to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> had returned to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by noon. Nine protesters were arrested in the raid. Eight have since been released, police said. The demonstrators were protesting plans to build a highway through a park nearby. When more than 900 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police moved in to clear the area, nearly 200 protesters were already sitting on the 13-foot-high wall. They earlier declared that they would seek `` political asylum'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> if West German police tried to rout them. East German guards backed trucks up to the eastern side of the wall to make it easier for the environmentalists to jump down and escape the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police. One smiling East German guard even helped one of the protesters by pulling his bicycle over the wall. The action to clear the squatters from the 10-acre piece of property known as the `` Lenne Triangle'' occurred after it formally came under <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s control one minute after midnight. It was handed over under the terms of a deal worked out with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> this year. The protesters occupied the area on May 26 and quickly set up a shantytown and erected barriers to protect them from police charges. The property has been the scene of frequent violent skirmishes between police and demonstrators. Protesters often attacked police with bottles, stones and Molotov cocktails, and officers responded with tear gas and water cannons. Police could not legally enter the property until it came under <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> control.

 Parliament today condemned a Romanian plan to resettle ethnic Hungarians and called on <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> to reconsider the move. The resolution made no reference to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s decision this week to close a Hungarian consulate and expell its staff. It also did n't mention the order to close a Hungarian cultural center in the Romanian capital <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON>, head of the foreign relations committee that drafted the document, appealed to Hungarians `` not to yield to emotions'' regarding the `` disquieting developments reported from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> maintains the program of moving residents of 7,000 villages to new agricultural-industrial centers would destroy ethnic Hungarian culture and tradition in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> says it would help villagers by providing services now enjoyed only in cities. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s treatment of its 1.7 million Hungarian residents has long been a sticky issue between the two <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> claims the Hungarian minority is discriminated against. <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s criticism is interference in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s internal affairs <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Tuesday closed <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s consulate in <LOCATION> Cluj </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, home to most of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s ethnic Hungarians, to protest a demonstration by 50,000 people in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> against the resettlement program. <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> also insisted that the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> move out of rooms rented for a cultural center. Official media in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> reported that Romanian authorities also were sending back some Hungarian travelers without giving any reason for the move. A Hungarian border official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said today there was no official ban. The parliamentary document, which is to be sent to the Romanian legislature, said the beginning of the Romanian program would further weaken Hungarian-Romanian relations. The document said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> hoped <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> `` would reexamine its ... plans and will refrain from their implementation.'' `` This would remove an important obstacle to the rapprochement between the Hungarian and <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> people,'' the document said. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> appealed for dialogue with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, who is also premier, said the tension was temporary and warned against drawing long-term conclusions. He told Western journalists he would go ahead with a planned visit to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> because `` if we do n't talk to each other we can not understand each other.'' No date for the trip has been announced, but it is believed <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> after visits in July to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On Thursday, a Hungarian diplomat in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> had declared <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s cultural center in the Romanian capital closed and ordered the embassy to vacate the building. The cultural center was never issued a permit to start operation and has been used as a storage for the embassy in recent years.

 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s move to shut down a Hungarian consulate was unprecedented in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance and shows how historically rooted ethnic strife can foul up Soviet-led attempts to forge unity in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Seventy years after <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> gained the region of <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the two neighbors are still bickering over treatment of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians who live in the fictional homeland of Count Dracula. In the past two years, the dispute has escalated sharply, pointing up the difference between <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reform-minded communism and the inflexible regime of <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, which is increasingly isolated even among its East bloc allies. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s decision Tuesday to close the general consulate in <LOCATION> Cluj-Napoca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> came in retaliation for an anti-Romanian rally in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the Hungarian capital, on Monday night. About 50,000 Hungarians protested <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s plans to destroy 7,000 Romanian villages, including hundreds of Hungarian communities. Today, the Hungarian parliament condemned the resettlement plan and urged <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> to reconsider the move. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> maintains the plan would destroy the Hungarians' cultural heritage and ultimately wipe out Hungarian and other minorities in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> Romanian officials said the villages to be razed by the year 2000 would be replaced by agricultural-industrial centers designed to remove differences between country and city dwellers. Hungarian officials at a mass meeting on <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s Heroes Square Monday evening said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> probably will seek international support to pressure <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to cancel the project. But <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected Hungarian protests as `` nationalistic, chauvinistic, anti-Romanian and anti-Socialist.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s address indicated that relations have reached their lowest ebb in post-war communist history. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> long has complained about acts of official discrimination against its Hungarian minority across the border and asserted that its people are denied important cultural and ethnic rights. The ethnic Hungarians, known in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> as Magyars, live in a 21,000-square-mile area of some of the most picturesque mountain and farm land in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. The land was under Hungarian control for nine centuries but was given to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Dec. 1, 1919, as part of the dismemberment of the Austro-Hungarian empire after World War I. Nazi dictator <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> returned much of the land to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> during World War II in appreciation of the loyalty of the country's ruler, Adm. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Horthy </PERSON> After the war the Allies gave <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> back to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The Romanians support their claim to the land by arguing that Romanized Dacians, their apparent ancestors, stayed in the area after the Romans withdrew from what is now <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in the 3rd century A.D. But Hungarian scholars maintain the Dacians withdrew along with their Roman protectors south of the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> river and that the Magyars found a largely empty country when they drifted in from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in the 9th century. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> relinquished its claim to <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> by signing the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> agreements recognizing post-war borders, but the Hungarian government and people remain deeply interested in the area's Hungarian minority. `` Treatment of national minorities in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is synonymous with South African apartheid,'' Hungarian poet <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Illyes </PERSON> said 10 years ago. The Romanian government says its treatment of the Hungarian and German minorities is fair. It accuses <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> of chauvinism and interfererence in its internal affairs and says <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is trying to regain <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>. Last April, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> strongly criticized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for decreeing that Romanian-language place names must be used for cities and villages traditionally known to the country's ethnic minorities in their own language. In March, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> took the unprecedented action of approving about $ 6 million to help thousands of ethnic Hungarian refugees who have fled the shortages and harsh living conditions in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The refugees, believed to number up to 20,000 now, also include several hundred Romanian speakers who are seeking to settle in the West.

 President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> today withdrew a slander suit filed against <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> last year called <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> cited three reasons for the move in a letter sent to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> prosecutor's office. `` First, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has refused legal assistance, which is in contrast to international legal norms,'' and this ruled out a quick court action, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said. `` Second, the -LRB- international -RRB- commission of historians, private undertakings as well as international historians have determined <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s personal innocence. `` Third, there is an endeavor -LRB- on the part of the president -RRB- to contribute to calming down and reconciliation,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in December 1987 that it has evidence of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s complicity in the transfer of civilian prisoners to the Nazi SS for exploitation in labor camps during World War II, the deportations of Jews from <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> islands to concentration or death camps, the execution of Allied prisoners and the execution of hostages and other civilians. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied wrongdoing. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> stopped the suit also `` to calm things down for <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, because the country always has priority over personal matters.'' It was believed that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> decided to stop legal proceedings against <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> because there was virtually no chance for the court action ever to take place in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and even less chance that it would take place in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. With the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> unwilling to cooperate by having <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> testify in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court, and with <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> refusing to appear in an Austrian court, the lawsuit might never have been resolved. A report issued by an international commission of historians in February did not say if <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was involved in wartime atrocities but it made clear that as an intelligence officer in the German army, he was aware of them and did nothing to prevent them. The document seriousl questioned <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s integrity and led to widespread calls for his resignation, but the Austrian head of state refused to comply, insisting that the historians had cleared him of all charges. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> called on the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> prosecutor's office to sue <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> on May 7, 1987, two days after the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> president said he was `` part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine'' while serving in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during the war. According to a presidential statement issued at the time, the lawsuit was also based on a comment by <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> who reportedly said if <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` has any patriotism in his soul whatsoever, his doctors would find reasons for him to resign his post.'' The third <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> comment cited by the president said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s `` misdeeds and his lying about his past'' were so obvious that it would be `` almost a crime against humanity to have very much to do with this man.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> official whose home was searched by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in connection with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement investigation staged a campaign fund-raiser for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, The Sun reported today. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> organized a cocktail party held July 9, 1987, at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> at the time was an assistant to <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> vice president who is currently a consultant to the company. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> is now marketing manager for the defense electronics plant. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> was first publicly noted on May 1 when the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Democrat's top aide, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, apparently jumped to his death from his 24th floor <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel room. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON> and another aide were in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for a $ 4,000 weekend paid for, in large part, by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> searched <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s office on June 14 and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s home the following week. Neither man responded to requests for interviews by The Sun. Ms. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said her boss remembered seeing <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> at the party but that he could n't remember the names of any other guests. `` We have no idea who they are,'' she told The Sun. `` They attended this fund-raiser that was put together by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>.

The newspaper also reported that on the same day as the fund-raiser, <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> received $ 1,000 campaign donations from three other people whose offices or businesses have been searched by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> records show that <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> collected a total of $ 16,000 in political contributions that day, the newspaper reported.

 An inmate has been transferred from a federal prison for violating a ban on working as a reporter, and the prisoner's editor called the move punishment for criticizing the warden in print. <PERSON> Dannie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 48, whose June 19 article on conditions at <ORGANIZATION> Lompoc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION> appeared in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chronicle-Examiner </LOCATION>, was moved Thursday to another facility, said <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION> Associate Warden <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON>. `` I feel <PERSON> Dannie </PERSON> has been transferred as a punitive response to material the Chronicle chose to print in order to keep its readers informed on important issues,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, editor of the Sunday feature section that has published 20 articles by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in the past two years. `` Convicts have the right to communicate with news media under special mail rights and the paper had a First Amendment right to publish,'' he added. <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was transferred for violating prison regulations against inmates working as journalists. <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> said he could not discuss whether <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was paid for his articles. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, serving time for bank robbery, was put in an isolation ward for 24 hours last week by Warden <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> after a story by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> of turning the prison into `` a caldron of fear, hatred and violence.'' The headline over the story read `` Gulag Mentality.'' Among other things, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Rison </PERSON>'s policy of keeping the recreation yard closed until noon. `` Those of us who work on night jobs and ran and exercised in the mornings now sit in gloomy cell blocks watching the sun shine through the window bars,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Rison </PERSON> said that he put <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> in confinement to protect him from other inmates angered by the article. He said a reference to possible riots at the maximum-security prison could spark a demonstration. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was returned to the general prison population after an investigation determined he was under no threat. <PERSON> Hofer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s intention to continue writing for the newspaper `` jeopardizes the safe and orderly operation of the institution and can not be tolerated.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s destination could not be released until he arrived there, prison officials said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s next article will appear Sunday and describes his stay in confinement, said <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> talks about his fear of transfer in the report. The two <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> papers produce a joint edition on Sunday, with the Examiner handling news and the Chronicle handling features.

<HEAD>Norden Drops Out Of Bidding Due To Pentagon Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, under investigation for allegedly receiving confidential bidding information on a <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> air command system, has withdrawn its bid on the $ 120 million contract, its parent company said today. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> became the first known contractor to fall out of a competition in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scandal. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, had been considered a top contender for the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> contract. The company, which manufactures radar systems and other military electronic materials, is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading defense contractor based here. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> pulled out of the competition on June 24, 10 days after investigators disclosed that the company was among those implicated in the illegal sharing of classified or proprietary information among <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees, private consultants and defense industry contractors. `` No reassignments or change in duties have been made in connection with the investigation,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said today. <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> made the letter public after an inquiry from a reporter, <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>'s withdrawal from the competition in today's editions. `` We believe, at this point in time, that it is of paramount importance for the public as well as the government to have full confidence in the integrity of the ... procurement process,'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonucci </PERSON>, <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> manager of contracts, wrote in the letter. `` Given the background of the current investigation and that the relevant facts have not yet been developed, we have concluded that <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>' withdrawal from the ... competition is the best course for us to follow,'' the letter continued. The letter states that <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> `` would be pleased to reconsider its decision'' to withdraw if the government were to delay a final decision on awarding the contract until more details of the scandal are known. On June 14, federal investigators searched <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> offices in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bridgeport </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON>. A day later, the <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> home of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapinac </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Norden </LOCATION> senior vice president for business development, also was searched. The contract that <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> sought calls for the construction of a high-tech portable shelter used near a battlefield to control aircraft in all kinds of weather. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit said the contract is worth about $ 120 million. The affidavit said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> civilian employee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> called defense consultant <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> at home on Sept. 30, 1987, and read him sealed bid figures on the contract by 10 potential suppliers, including <PERSON> Norden </PERSON>. <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> had submitted its bid on Aug. 24, 1987. The documents said <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> shared the information with <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON>.

 Transportation officials said today they would investigate why airport workers in <LOCATION> Reggio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION> turned off the runway lights and closed the airport for the night as a jetliner with 103 people aboard approached for a landing. The domestic airline <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Alitalia </ORGANIZATION>, said the DC-9 was 60 seconds from touching down Wednesday when the control tower broke radio contact and the lights went out. Officials said the pilot quickly gained altitude and flew to <LOCATION> Lamezia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terme </LOCATION>, 100 miles north to the north. `` In no part of the world is an airplane authorized to approach and then be abandoned at the moment of landing,'' <PERSON> Ettore </PERSON> <PERSON> Grion </PERSON>, deputy operations director of <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> AGI </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying. According to newspaper accounts, the jet left <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> 3 -LCB- hours late Tuesday night because of air traffic congestion. As it approached <ORGANIZATION> Reggio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Calabria </ORGANIZATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the airport control tower radioed that the airport closed at 1 a.m. and that the pilot had 11 minutes to land. `` They told us they would n't wait a second longer. At 1 a.m. they shut down,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> L'Unita </ORGANIZATION> quoted the pilot as saying. Newspaper accounts said the pilot tried to make the landing on time, but at 1 a.m. exactly the runway went dark. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has ordered an investigation, a spokesman said.

 The steel-blue early hairstreak butterfly was spotted in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for the first time in nearly a century, a naturalist said. <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> said she saw 20 early hairstreaks, considered one of the rarest butterflies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in the beginning of June on <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greylock </ORGANIZATION>, the state's highest peak. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> saw four early hairstreaks on June 13, one of which she netted. In the two weeks that followed, several more were spotted by her and other Audubon members on <ORGANIZATION> Greylock </ORGANIZATION>. `` When I netted it, I knew it was something I had n't seen before,'' she said. `` I looked it up in the guide and realized what I had. `` Naturally I was excited,'' she said. `` When a fisherman catches a big fish, he gets excited. It's the same idea.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s conservation department and coordinator of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Butterfly Atlas Project, called the early hairstreak `` one of the great mysterious species'' of the world. `` It was last seen by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Scudder </PERSON> himself, the patron saint of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> butterfly collectors,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Scudder </ORGANIZATION> made the rare butterfly legendary by including it in a book on butterflies in 1898, after he also sighted it on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greylock </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Scudder </ORGANIZATION> `` wrote that he exulted over finding this rare butterfly,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` Since then, nobody has seen it and it is right at the top of the list of everybody's great finds.'' <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> secretary who lives in <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, said she came upon the butterfly on a dirt road in the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greylock </LOCATION> reservation near <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The hairstreak, which usually dwells in treetops, was sitting in the road. Less than an inch long, the hairstreak is generally steel-blue with black tips; it may also have a row of reddish-white rimmed spots, a white fringe or a dusting of orange.

<HEAD>Poles Buy Unrationed Gas for First Time in Seven Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gasoline stations across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Friday struggled to cope with demand when gasoline without ration coupons went on sale legally for the first time since 1981. Customers at gasoline station No. 560 on Silver Street in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> waited an average of four hours in the hot sun to pay $ 2.69 a gallon, compared with the ration price of $ 1.58 a gallon. By midday, station manager <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuszewski </PERSON> and his co-workers had pumped as much gasoline as they normally had in an entire day when the station sold rationed gasoline. Faces fell when a young man asked for 36.4 gallons at a cost of $ 98, about the average monthly wage. He filled his car and six big canisters, enduring hostile comments from fellow customers. At noon, a truck delivered more gas, reassuring those at the end of the 120-car line monitored by police to prevent double parking. The primarily male clientele read, picnicked, and played cards while waiting. The delivery driver brought word that four more gas stations would sell the unrationed gas, in addition to the two stations initially authorized for <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, a city of 1.5 million people. Some of the customers made a mad dash for the newly added stations. `` People are satisfied because they can at least get gasoline now,'' said <PERSON> Magnuszewski </PERSON>. State-run TV reported the new regulations and said customers interviewed had thanked the state gas monopoly for the opportunity to buy unrationed gas. The impatient customers at station No. 560 seemed to think otherwise. `` It's a bad idea _ a scandal. It's very uncomfortable to stand in this crowd of machines. I see the crowd and I do n't want to stand in line,'' said <PERSON> Krzystof </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. He ultimately took a place in line. Some people feared the new regulations are a government ruse to raise prices even further. The government announced the regulations Tuesday. The Central Oil Products Monopoly initially planned to make the unrationed gasoline available at 64 gas stations nationwide. The State Monopolys' director <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Szewczyk </PERSON> said about 60 million gallons non-rationed gasoline would be sold at the higher price this year, less than 10 percent of all gasoline to be sold in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and that if demand exceeded supply the price would be raised. A sufficient supply of gas is a constant concern for Polish car owners. Under current regulations, every private car owner receives a monthly gas ration based on the car size. Owners of small cars are entitled to 6.2 gallons, while those with medium and large cars can get 9.4 gallons. Additional gasoline could be purchased on a black-market basis at some stations, but even that source does not meet demand. The government introduced rationing in mid-1981 when panic buying during the Solidarity period resulted in periodic shortages. Most of the oil <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs to manufacture gasoline comes from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which has been reluctant to increase supplies to its East bloc allies, especially now that it too faces energy shortages. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> lacks hard currency to buy much crude on the world market.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met today with President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> after discussing with Nicaraguan rebels possible ways of making <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' regional peace plan succeed. Hundreds of flag-waving Costa Rican children greeted <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> after he flew here following visits to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is on the last stop of his three-day Central American tour. He spent Thursday night in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a leader of the Nicaraguan rebels, said today in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> that the administration and pro-rebel members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are considering a $ 30 million aid package for the rebels over a six-month period. A portion of the money, perhaps $ 7 million, would be placed in an escrow account and released as military aid for the Contras if <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government does not meet democratic reforms mandated in <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' peace plan, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. There was no immediate word on what <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> discussed. Administration officials said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and rebel leaders only touched briefly on the Contra issue. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for drawing up a plan that calls for cease-fires in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wars, democratic reforms, and an end to outside aid to insurgents. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with the rebel leadership after visiting <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for talks with top officials Thursday. He began his Central American tour in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> Wednesday. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Thursday in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, that he has shared ideas with Central American leaders on a diplomatic solution to the Nicaraguan problem, but he gave no details. He said he planned to discuss these ideas with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Contra supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been discussing the possibility of seeking approval for new military aid for the rebels to be placed in an escrow account. The Contras have received no military aid since Feb. 29, and congressional approval of a new package of lethal assistance without conditions is thought to have scant support among lawmakers. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 17 million humanitarian aid package in late March after the rebels and the Sandinista government agreed on an interim cease-fire. Efforts by the Sandinistas and the Contras to reach agreement on a permanent cease-fire broke down June 9 and no new talks have been scheduled. The Contras have said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> backed away from their earlier promises to enact democratic reforms. The Sandinistas have said the Contras were just using the talks as a pretext to get more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who briefed reporters after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>' meeting with the Contras said the possibility of resuming negotiations was discussed So far, the administration has said only that it plans to seek renewed aid for the Contras, but no final decision on a package was to be made until after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s trip. The administration, by weighing the possibility of offering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION>, appears to believe that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> may be receptive to a proposal that would benefit it economically. Despite massive support from the Soviet bloc, the Nicaraguan economy has continued to unravel, crippled by the civil war. On several occasions during his <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> trip, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has quoted Sandinista officials as saying <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s inflation rate this year is running at 20,000 percent. Economic aid would be a sharp reversal of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy. In addition to funding the Contras, the administration has a trade embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> headed for home Friday, riding out of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on the back of another ship 11 weeks after an Iranian mine nearly sank it. The 3,600-ton warship rode in a special cradle atop the Mighty Servant 2, a heavy-lift cargo vessel the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chartered from a Dutch salvage firm for $ 1.3 million. Emergency repairs to the frigate's badly ripped hull were made at <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. Its early morning departure from the emirate in the southern gulf was a surprise because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials had indicated earlier the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> would pass through the narrow <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> at night for security reasons. As the Mighty Servant 2 and its piggyback cargo approached the strait, the The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired an artillery salute. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was on patrol near <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has threatened shipping with gunboats and missile batteries since early in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. About 30 of its crew members are accompanying the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, on a trip expected to take about 40 days. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the frigate would be rebuilt at the shipyard in <LOCATION> Bath </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where it was launched in 1986. Officials have denied reports the $ 400 million ship would be scrapped, but hull damage from the April 14 mine explosion was so extensive that salvage experts advised against trying to tow it across the stormy <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Departure of the `` <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON>,'' as crewmen called their ship, came 11 weeks to the day after it sailed inadvertently into what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers said was a newly laid Iranian minefield and collided with a submerged mine while trying to back out. Ten crewmen were wounded in the explosion, which wrecked the engine room, broke the keel of the 453-foot vessel and started fires and flooding. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces retaliated with attacks on two Iranian oil platforms April 18 that led to a day of confrontation in the southern gulf in which six Iranian naval craft were sunk or disabled. The Mighty Servant 2 is a `` semi-submersible'' ship, described as one of only two in the world capable of carrying the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> home. Both are owned by the the Dutch salvage firm <ORGANIZATION> Wijsmuller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier in the week, the frigate was towed out of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> and floated over the submerged deck of the cargo vessel, which was then raised to normal level, leaving the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> high and dry.

<TEXT>
 About 6,000 pounds of cocaine concealed in blocks of melted chocolate was confiscated and three men were arrested in what authorities described today as the largest seizure of cocaine in the Northeast. The drugs have a street value of about $ 480 million, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The cocaine was discovered June 24 aboard a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cargo ship coming from <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Agent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baish </PERSON>, in charge of the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Baish </PERSON> said it was a `` cold hit,'' meaning inspectors had no previous tip about the shipment. He said inspectors decided to drill a hole in several of 1,200 cardboard cartons marked cocoa because it had come from <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, a frequent exporter of cocaine. The smugglers had poured melted chocolate on the bottom of each carton, concealed the cocaine in a metal container and plastic sleeve in the center and then poured melted chocolate over it, letting it harden, <PERSON> Baish </PERSON> said. At least 779 of the cartons had cocaine in the middle, said <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>. He said officials were still opening the boxes. Customs agents resealed the boxes and watched as they were taken to <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in an industrial section of <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Baish </PERSON> said. When the men inside the warehouse began opening the boxes, some 50 law enforcement agents moved in, <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. He said the three men arrested are believed to be connected to the <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> family in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which he described as one of the largest producers and exporters of cocaine.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> was honored with the chairmanship of a session of the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference on Friday, one day after he was criticized for contributing to the country's stagnation. Soviet television showed <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, 78, standing at a lectern in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s Palace of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as he opened the morning session. On Thursday, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON>, party boss in the Russian republic's region of <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION>, told the conference that Soviets want high officials who served under <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> removed. `` Those who in the past actively promoted the policy of stagnation may not serve and work on the central party and government bodies now,'' <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> said. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> interrupted to ask who <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> had in mind, and among those the <LOCATION> Komi </LOCATION> official listed was <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a delegate later sent a note to the conference organizers saying <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who spent 28 years as foreign minister, had devoted his life to communism. But it added: `` We have worked him too hard. And comrade <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> today has fallen behind the times.'' When <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> was named to the largely ceremonial post of president in 1985, observers believed this was a graceful way to move the elder statesman out of the mainstream of Soviet policy-making. The criticism of him at the conference might indicate he will be eased out of the leadership entirely. The chairmanship of the conference is also largely ceremonial and was rotated among most of the 13 members of the party's ruling Politburo. Another of <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON>'s targets, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, 74, head of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, chaired Friday's afternoon session

 When Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> was picked to chair the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, the well-respected but relatively little-known <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Democrat found himself thrust into the limelight. During the weeks of nationally televised joint <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings, amid a cast of colorful characters like <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> displayed the traits he was best known for on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ caution, fairness, even-handedness. When the hearings ended, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> resumed his usual low profile. But in recent weeks, he's been flirting with fame again, mentioned as a possible running mate for Democratic nominee-to-be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> appeared with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor made a campaign visit to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Thursday night. At a town meeting in <LOCATION> Terre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haute </LOCATION>, local Democrats were selling Dukakis-Hamilton buttons for a dollar each. `` Not bad, not bad,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said when he was presented with one. `` Has kind of a nice ring to it, does n't it?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides say the two got acquainted at a dinner before <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s May 3 primary, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> won handily. `` I think there is a great deal of mutual respect,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s office says he has complied with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's request for detailed background information being sought from prospective running mates on everything from his finances to his driving record. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edley </PERSON>, issues director for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has consulted <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> on a variety of issues, particularly foreign affairs. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 57, joined the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> as a freshman congressman in 1965. He is now second in line behind Chairman <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON> and is seen as likely to come into the chairmanship eventually. After the 1984 election, he was picked to chair the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Many observers believe <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will choose a running mate with strong foreign affairs experience to make up for his own lack of background in that area. But even with his foreign-policy expertise as a selling point, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s chances of being tapped for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket appear remote. He himself plays down the prospect. `` I guess I still feel it would be rather unusual for him to come to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> for a nominee,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're a relatively small state. We do n't have a large number of electoral votes.'' And <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> might not even be able to deliver his home state in the general election. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is traditionally Republican. However, that rule does n't seem to apply in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>'s district. He was elected by a landslide in 1964 and has won re-election by large margins. In 1976, the Republicans did n't even bother fielding a candidate. The son of a Methodist minister, <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> shares some personality traits with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Neither could be described as flamboyant. Both are cerebral types, lawyerly lawyers. They have in common a dogged competitive streak. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> was a high school basketball star in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, leading his team to the state finals, and he played college basketball at <ORGANIZATION> Depauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> has a reputation for being earnest and strait-laced. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> for decades has sported a 1950s-style crew cut. He told an interviewer last year that he has let his hair grow out only once _ while he was attending <ORGANIZATION> Goethe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on scholarship before going to law school at <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was the only time I ever let my hair grow long,'' he said. `` I just was n't comfortable with it.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> appears to share <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' conviction that a well-managed government can cure many ills. When the Iran-Contra hearings ended, many of the committee members, especially Democrats, expressed dismay about the foreign-policy fiasco that had unfolded in the testimony they heard. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> agreed with his fellow legislators that the hearings had been `` depressing.'' But he also struck a positive note, saying `` the process has been refreshing.'' `` We know better what happened and what mistakes were made,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` We can see more clearly what needs to be done to make our system work better.''

 Along just 35 miles of interstate, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cpl </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Durnan </PERSON> confiscated $ 7 million worth of drugs, money and guns last year during otherwise routine stops for traffic violations. `` You get a sense like you're absolutely doing something good,'' said <PERSON> Durnan </PERSON>, who is n't sure how many arrests he made on <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s short segment of I-95 `` Nothing beats the thrill of making that arrest.'' <PERSON> Durnan </PERSON>, 35, is one of a special breed that <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gospodarek </PERSON> calls `` super cops.'' In 33 states, highway patrol officers on routine patrol are part of `` Operation Pipeline,'' using traffic stops to collar criminals and make big drug busts instead of just writing speeding tickets, he said. Nationwide, 8 -LCB- percent of the nation's cocaine seizures in 1987 were executed during traffic stops and $ 18.6 million in cash was seized, according to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Operation Pipeline,'' which began slowly in 1983-84, has forced a nationwide rerouting of drug traffic, said <PERSON> Gospodarek </PERSON>, who coordinates the program. But it is also drawing criticism from defense lawyers and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, who contend the stops are pretenses for drug searches and therefore violate the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unlawful search and seizure. In some cases the stops are discriminatory, said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>. `` The real question is whether the people are stopped for absolutely legitimate reasons and subsequently an officer's suspicion is aroused and he then asks consent Or if a cop sees two Hispanic males in a Cadillac with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> plates and sees them going 66 mph _ that's not a legitimate stop,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> said the courts have not ruled definitively on the issue. `` Some courts say if the car's going 66 mph in a 65 mph zone, that's a reasonable stop,'' he said. `` Other courts say if the only person stopped is a Hispanic male driving a <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> _ that's not reasonable.'' State police and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> officials say the key to the arrests is good police work and that they do not have a profile of the type of person to pull over. `` It's strictly a traffic officer who makes a legal traffic stop and looks beyond it,'' said <PERSON> Gospodarek </PERSON>. `` A lot of troopers making the seizures are the same guys over and over _ they're super cops.'' The officers say their success is based on awareness. `` I believe after you've made your first one, it just gets in your system. The adrenalin gets flowing,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON>, 34, who patrols I-75, a northward route out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` It makes you want to get back out there and make another one.'' `` I got it bad, I'll stay out there all night,'' said another <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer, <PERSON> Benji </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>. DEA estimates 15.4 pounds of cocaine an hour pass through <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on the interstate, he said. <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Ralston </PERSON> each seized about 400 pounds of cocaine last year. `` It's a lot of fun, you never know what you'll get into,'' <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> said. After making a traffic stop, officers look for a number of signs. Among those listed by <PERSON> Durnan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> and other officers were nervousness, signs of false walls or altered gas tanks, the smell of air freshener, conflicting stories from driver and passenger, or the driver of a car not listed as stolen who ca n't identify the owner. Officers then ask permission to search the car or get a search warrant, <PERSON> Gospodarek </PERSON> said. He and other officers interviewed said rarely does a driver refuse consent. <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, defense attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollander </PERSON> says that's because stopped drivers are n't often asked But several officers said it's because traffickers are confident the drugs are well hidden. Drug traffickers attempt to avoid areas of high numbers of arrests, but they do n't always succeed. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Detective <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Butz </PERSON> said he and his colleagues have made `` lots of arrests where they had maps to avoid <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.'' He said the traffickers got lazy and ignored their route instructions.

<HEAD>Office, Factory Construction Improved Building Outlook in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction spending advanced 1.1 percent in May as strength in office and factory construction offset weakness in other areas, the government reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 407.1 billion in May following a 0.2 percent dip in April. The May gain, the strongest since a 2.8 percent rise in March, came entirely from gains in non-residential construction, which rose 4.3 percent to an annual rate of $ 98.9 billion. The increase was led by a 7.8 percent advance in office construction, which pushed this category up by 11 percent over May 1987, and a 7.7 percent advance in factory construction, where activity was 22.8 percent higher than a year ago. Analysts said the rise in office construction, after a sustained period of weakness, reflected strong activity in certain sections of the country such as the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and a halt to the giant plunge in building which had occurred in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, hard hit because of troubles in the oil patch. `` Cities such as <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, are enjoying good economic growth and a fair amount of offfice construction,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, senior economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is happening while the sharp declines in other areas have at least bottomed out.'' Peach said the big jump in factory construction reflected the capital spending boom occuring as manufacturers rush to expand capacity to meet sharply higher demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. Residential construction fell 1 percent during May to an annual rate of $ 193.4 billion, reflecting a 1.3 percent drop in construction of single-family homes which offset a 2.4 percent rise in the smaller apartment sector. Analysts do not expect much strength in this area during the year, particularly because of high vacancy rates in the apartment sector and the loss of tax advantages for investing in housing real estate. Government construction projects edged down 0.3 percent in May to an annual rate of $ 78.9 billion with highway construction, the biggest segment in the government sector, suffering a 7.4 percent decline. The various changes left overall construction spending 2.3 percent higher than it was a year ago.

 A federal appeals court has refused to allow the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to begin random drug testing of all 13,000 federal prison employees during an appeal of a ruling prohibiting the program. In an order made public Friday, Judges <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> denied the administration's request to let the testing program proceed while the case is appealed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> blocked the program from taking effect as scheduled May 23 and then issued a preliminary injunction June 16 that continues the ban until a union's lawsuit against the program goes to trial. <PERSON> Weigel </PERSON> said the government had shown no justification for testing `` innocent, law-abiding and wholly competent'' workers. He noted that the proposed drug testing would apply to clerical employees outside the prison walls as well as armed guards. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> is appealing his ruling and asked the appeals court for a stay that would have allowed testing to begin. The bureau was to have been one of the first federal agencies to implement drug testing under a September 1986 executive order by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who ordered testing of all federal workers in `` sensitive'' jobs. The bureau has declared all of its employees hold `` sensitive'' jobs. The program would require random testing of 5 percent to 10 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> staff each year, with additional testing of managers, probationary employees, and those involved in accidents. Workers showing signs of illegal drug use could be disciplined the first time and fired the second time. The suit by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> contends drug testing without individual suspicion of drug use violates the constitutional ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. The suit also claims violations of federal laws banning discrimination against the handicapped and requiring discipline to be based on job performance. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to rule on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration drug testing programs involving customs employees and railroad workers, in cases to be heard in the term that begins this fall.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Salvage workers today resumed efforts to raise a sunken tanker after toxic chemicals began leaking from the ship, Dutch television reported. Television reports said workers sawed the Dutch chemical tanker <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broere </PERSON> into two pieces and planned to hoist the parts from the floor of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. It said none of the highly poisonous acrylonitrile stored in tanks escaped during the operation. On Thursday, salvage crews had to flee when an acrylonitrile tank suddenly sprang a leak during efforts to lift the ship, a coast guard spokesman said. No injuries were reported. Workers used a 16-ton chain to separate the ship's back section, which contains the engine room, from the front part where the tanks are located, the television report said. Crews have been trying to salvage the ship and its dangerous cargo since May 27, when the <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broere </PERSON> sank after a collision with a freighter off the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' west coast. It was carrying 1,600 tons of acrylonitrile, a highly carcinogenic and inflammable agent used by the plastics industry. The two sections were expected to lifted to the surface during the weekend, the report said. Water samples taken during Thursday's salvage attempt showed a sudden increase in the levels of acrylonitrile in the water at the site, according to a coast guard official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said that at about 9.30 p.m. Thursday, those levels rose to more than seven times the amount considered safe by the Dutch environment ministry. The divers immediately boarded small boats kept nearby for emergencies after the release of the toxic chemicals, the spokesman said. A first attempt to salvage the <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broere </PERSON> failed when two of the four steel cables holding the vessel broke, causing the ship to disappear in the waves again.

 <ORGANIZATION> Grasshoppers </ORGANIZATION> and other insects left hungry by the drought are wreaking havoc on what remains in farm fields, while young trees are depending on young people scooping buckets of water from city lakes to sustain them. The good news is a low mosquito population this summer _ but `` I'd rather have the moisture on my grass,'' says <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosquito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. Yellowjackets and wasps may take the place of mosquitoes and be more aggressive at picnics and near garbage cans as they search for food, said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> entomologist <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. `` It could be that they just die from a lack of food. But it also could be that they will be driven to interact with people when they might not normally do that,'' he said. Other insects also are taking a toll. `` We've definitely seen more treatment for grasshoppers than at any time I remember,'' said <PERSON> Carlyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Holen </PERSON>, area extension agent in crop pest management in northwestern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Crookston </LOCATION> office. `` Many thousands of acres have been treated over the past month, and there still are fields that need treatment that perhaps the farmers have n't even discovered yet,'' he said. Wheat-stem maggots, normally found in 1 percent of the fields in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, are showing up this summer in 30 percent to 40 percent of the fields, <PERSON> Holen </PERSON> said. The maggots sever wheat and barley stems. Dry weather appears to be responsible for a large drop in the number of European corn borers that feed on corn plant leaves and later bore into the stem. Record dryness coupled with near-record heat during the past few months has stressed young trees and forced wildlife to change their habits. Young trees planted in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> over the past several years to replace those ravaged by Dutch elm disease are facing the dual threat of insufficient moisture and hungry insects such as aphids and bark beetles, said <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> this week recruited 260 inner-city young people to dip buckets into the city's lakes and pour the water on young trees nearby. The lakes, highly popular for sailing, swimming and picnicking, are down slightly. The city already maintains its 160,000 young trees planted in the past 10 years with 23 water trucks. But the concern now is to spread the word via the bucket brigade to homeowners. `` We thought that if people down at the lakes saw all the kids down there watering the trees that are starting to wilt and dry, people will catch on to the news that many of the small trees are wilting and severely stressed and that they all should be out there watering,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> special projects director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Domholt </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, which draws all its water from the depleted <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, has instituted limited lawn sprinkling restrictions; adjacent St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is seeking voluntary conservation. Both cities have agreed to take stronger measures if the river falls below a certain point. Duck-hunters face a shortened waterfowl season this year as the birds move to regions with more moisture in search of nesting sites, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremicker </PERSON>, resource manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` The drought quickly deteriorated a lot of the good breeding wetlands,'' <PERSON> Bremicker </PERSON> said. `` The ducks then delay nesting or they do n't nest at all. They move into the northern parklands in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where we still have a lot of water _ comparatively.'' Biologists also are concerned about other game. `` Any animal has a preferred climate, and when you move outside that preferred climate birds or mammals become stressed,'' <PERSON> Bremicker </PERSON> said.

 The nation's three largest rivers set a combined low-water record in June, running 45 percent below normal for the month, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, normally the nation's largest river, slipped to third place in terms of water flow, survey figures showed. Falling river levels, resulting from the nation's ongoing drought, have stalled barge traffic, threatened water quality and reduced availability of water for drinking and other uses. The June flow of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> rivers marked a decline from May, when their flow was 37 percent below normal, the survey reported. Their total flow had been 8 percent below average in April, which is considered within the normal range. The combined flow of the Big Three rivers averaged 481 billion gallons per day during June, the agency said. The lowest previous combined June flow for the three, in 60 years of record keeping, was 484 billion gallons per day in 1934. Water experts monitor the three rivers as a quick check of the nation's surface water resources, since they drain about half of the 48 contiguous states. For June, the nation's largest river turned out to be the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which averaged 182 billion gallons per day at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dalles </ORGANIZATION>, Ore. Even so, that was 42 percent below normal and the fourth lowest in 60 years of record keeping. In May it had been 27 percent below normal for the month. Second place for June went to the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which averaged 162 billion gallons per day, measured at <LOCATION> Massena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. That was 11 percent below normal but not in record-low contention It was the first time the St. Lawrence fell below normal since July 1967. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, though, fell to its lowest June level ever at the <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, measuring station. It managed only 136 billion gallons per day, 4 billion below the old record from June 1934 and 61 percent below normal for the month. In May, the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> had its second lowest flow for the month, trailing May of 1934. The Geological Survey also reported that the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> decreased sharply in June, averaging 17 billion gallons per day at <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. That was 59 percent below normal for the month and the sixth lowest ever And the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, at <LOCATION> Hermann </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, averaged 30 billion gallons per day, 46 percent below normal and the third lowest flow on record.

 More than 10,000 workers went on strike Friday against <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear submarines and the largest employer in the area, and no new contract talks were scheduled. The members of unions belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> walked off their jobs at midnight after voting 4,921-3 ,140 to reject the company's offer to pay them lump-sum bonuses in each of the next three years instead of higher wages Negotations between the <ORGANIZATION> MTC </ORGANIZATION>, which represents more than half of <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>'s 18,000 workers, broke down about a half-hour before the old three-year contract expired at midnight Thursday. State Labor Commissioner <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tianti </PERSON> said state mediators had been in touch with both sides, but neither side seemed interested in meeting. About 300 workers, some chanting obscenties, picketed outside four gates Friday morning. About 80 state and local police stood by. The pickets dwindled to about 50 by mid-afternoon. Police reported arrests of two men, one accused of setting off fireworks and the other accused of driving his car through police barricades in front of the plant. Owners of bars and liquor stores near the plant on the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> followed police requests to close Thursday and Friday. Grocery stores also stopped selling beer. The last MTC strike against <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> lasted five months in 1975 and had an estimated $ 42 million ripple-effect on the economy of southeastern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Electric Boat, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, is one of two shipyards making nuclear submarines for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the only manufacturer of giant subs capable of carrying the Trident missile. The shipyard has eight attack submarines and seven Trident submarines under construction, officials said. EB general manager <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> said a strike will not stop construction. The company arranged to reassign salaried employees, he said, adding there was also the possibility of hiring permanent replacements and subcontractors. EB offered employees bonuses worth 5 percent of a worker's wages during the first contract year and 4 percent during the second and third years of the pact. The union demanded wage increases of 5 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent. Electric Boat's `` last, best and final offer,'' presented Monday, called for bonuses totaling $ 4,250 over three years for a first-class mechanic making $ 12.02 an hour, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotir </PERSON>, vice president of human resources. Electric Boat insisted it could afford no more than cash bonuses to remain competitive in its pursuit of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday awarded Electric Boat this year's third and final SSN-688 attack submarine contract, worth $ 347.4 million. Contracts for two other attack subs were awarded recently to Electric Boat's only rival, the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drydock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, which pays its workers 60 cents an hour less.

 Cleaning up environmental contamination and correcting existing problems at the nation's nuclear weapons plants could cost between $ 40 billion and $ 70 billion, according to a government report released Friday. And the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> report said the price tag could be as high as $ 110 billion in order to maintain the environmental, safety and health standards at the plants through the year 2045. The report was released by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, who had requested it as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said the report puts a price tag on the department's `` shameful neglect'' toward the health and safety of the public `` We have a choice of paying the price with money or with the health and safety of our children and grandchildren,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. `` Those who would choose to poison our own people in order to make nuclear weapons should be asked what the weapons are supposed to protect us from.'' The department issued two sets of estimates: an `` expected'' projection representing the most likely requirements for each site; and a `` high'' projection of what could be required to meet more stringent interpretations of existing laws, regulations and policies that could reasonably be imposed on the defense plants. `` Within those bounds, the cleanup of contaminated sites and corrective actions could require between $ 40 billion and $ 70 billion in addition to an ongoing base program of $ 700 million per year,'' the department concluded. However, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said the estimate does not include the cost of high-level waste disposal, long-term monitoring, the decommissioning of abandoned nuclear reactors and modernizing the weapons complex. `` The figure of $ 110 billion is labeled a ` high' estimate by <PERSON> DOE </PERSON>, but I believe it is more likely to be a floor rather than a ceiling,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. The department's evaluation included 18 defense plants. It said most of the remedial cleanup actions could be completed within 20 years. Environmental corrective actions could include such things as improvements in stack exhaust, construction of radioactive waste treatment facilities, upgrading drinking water supplies and other activities. The department cautioned that the cost projections do not represent proposed action by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. It said the report identifies `` needs'' and will be used to formulate long-range plans, but that a decision to adopt the actions has not been made. By far the largest single price tag for cleanup and corrective actions is for the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The facility, established in 1943, recycles uranium and extracts plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel. The department estimated that cleanup and other costs at Hanford could reach $ 48 billion and that it could take until the year 2045 to complete the job. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has finally admitted the size and the scope of the defense waste cleanup problems at Hanford,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., adding that when estimated costs of other projects not included in the report are added, the total price tag for Hanford could reach $ 64 billion The department said a sampling of possible major environmental projects at the defense production plants includes: _ An environmental restoration program at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, $ 1.4 billion _ Environmental restoration at the Hanford site, $ 650 million _ A buried waste program at <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, $ 500 million _ Environmental restoration at the Rocky Flats plant in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, $ 345 million _ A basin closure program at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, $ 70 million _ Groundwater and soil investigations at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, $ 59 million _ Waste pit and silo cleanup at the Feed Materials Production Center near <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, $ 40 million _ Cleanup of polychlorinated biphenyls at the <ORGANIZATION> Portsmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaseous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diffusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; $ 38 million _ Environmental, health and safety actions at the Mound plant in <LOCATION> Miamisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, $ 30 million The agency also said major safety and health projects could include plantwide fire protection at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant, $ 200 million; an upgrade of the ventilation system at the Fernald plant, $ 55 million; and an asbestos management program at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, $ 52 million.

The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> excommunicated all five men after the ceremony in <LOCATION> Econe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, a Briton who converted from the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, recalled that the early Christian theologian <PERSON> Athanasius </PERSON> was excommunicated in the 4th century but eventually made a saint. <PERSON> Athanasius </PERSON> was a champion of orthodoxy in the 4th century intrigues over what became known as the Arian heresy. `` It was proved that <PERSON> Athanasius </PERSON> was right all along,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Econe </LOCATION>, the site of <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s Swiss seminary. The schism created by the consecrations and resulting excommunications was the first major split in the church since the so-called Old Catholics broke with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1870 after the doctrine of papal infallibility was proclaimed. When asked what practical consequences he expected the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sanction to bring, <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said: `` The fight has just started. I hope that the issues begin to clear and we will come out of this dreamland in which the devil has got vast numbers of people asleep, completely unaware there is a problem. The archbishop said today that he hopes this event will lance the abscess of modernist <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> shrugged off a statement by <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, who predicted 80 percent of <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s followers will leave him after the excommunication. `` Poor Father <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>,'' he said. `` He lives in a different world than from the world I live in.'' He was asked whether followers might be shocked by a sentence in <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s letter to the four new bishops that mentioned `` antichrists occupying the chair of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> and the posts of authority in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.'' In response, he said Christians believe there are `` many antichrists'' doing the work of `` the Antichrist, the one who is coming at the end of the world.'' `` Any enemy of the church is an antichrist,'' he said. `` It is strong language but you have to remember what the church was 30 years ago and see it today. There is no comparison. There has been a tremendous work of destruction since the Second Vatican Council.'' His reference was to the 1962-65 council that produced reforms <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> says are spreading the `` cancer of liberalism'' in the church. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said he was `` not sorry that the archbishop refused to enter into any compromise with those who do not understand tradition.'' To a question about whether the traditionalists were in schism, he replied that church documents prove <PERSON> Lefbvre </PERSON> is on the `` side of the absolute truth and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> is not. Therefore it is obviously not the archbishop who can be in schism.'' <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, 48, said he did not know of the traditionalist movement when he converted to Catholicism in 1971. When asked why he went to <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s seminary, he said: `` I was sent there by a mainstream priest who did not agree with the archbishop. He is an Irishman who said, ` If you keep on opening your big mouth there is only one place for you and that's Econe'.'' He said he planned to return on July 7 to his own seminary in <LOCATION> Ridgefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, which he said has 38 students.

 The nun abducted from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> convent is relaxed and well and unwilling to press charges against her family, police said Friday. `` She told us that she was not injured, and that she was not being held against her will,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulgin </PERSON>, chief of detectives. `` She was relaxed and smiling. ... We feel comfortable that she is in total control of her situation.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON>, 22, abducted Sunday by her family from the <LOCATION> Roundtop </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, convent where she was a novice nun, was interviewed Thursday by sheriff's investigators. Police in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> have been looking for the woman, also known as Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON>, since her father, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, and brothers <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> pushed her into a waiting car Sunday as she walked with two nuns on a street near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> Novitiate Convent in the <LOCATION> Catskill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> has said that the abduction took place so the family could raise objections with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> about the convent and its priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. The convent is operated by a group of conservative Catholics associated with Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, the French prelate who was excommunicated Thursday after a long dispute with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The sect has rebuffed modernist reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s and follows traditional practices, including conducting Mass in Latin. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> said his sister still wants to become a nun and that the family is searching for a convent for her to join. The family, through attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>, contacted <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities Thursday afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> have misdemeanor arrest warrants for Miss <PERSON> Greve </PERSON>'s father and brothers. <PERSON> Hulgin </PERSON> said the investigators' conversation with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> was tape-recorded and mailed to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> authorities. Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vansteenburg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the warrants against the family would `` most definitely'' be dropped once the tape was received and the reports from <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> confirmed. <PERSON> Hulgin </PERSON> said investigators did not delve into the particulars of the kidnapping or what had transpired since Sunday. `` Our concern was that she was not a victim,'' <PERSON> Hulgin </PERSON> said. Miss <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> and her parents `` wo n't be around for a while,'' <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Greve </PERSON> said Thursday. `` This has been tough on all of us. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> is very upset, and I'm a nervous wreck.

<TEXT>
 A severe drought in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s northwestern grainbelt is rapidly depleting wells and irrigation dams, leaving farmers with little more to do than `` stare at the sky. Vital cropland sits idle, cattle are dying and the government is wondering how it will pay for all the food it will have to import. `` We've got 15,000 tractors and 2,000 harvesting machines doing nothing,'' said <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> los </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, research chief for the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> in the northwestern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastal state of <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION>. Recent rains in other important agricultural areas prevented a national catastrophe, although wheat yields are down about 15 percent and other crops are expected to be off due to late planting and low soil moisture. But farmers and cattle ranchers in the northwest are facing what some have said is the worst drought in nearly half a century. Most affected are <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> and the northwestern border state of <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>. They have been dry for nearly a year. `` <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> is experiencing its worst drought in memory,'' <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. More than 20,000 head of cattle have died in <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> alone, <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, president of the state <ORGANIZATION> Cattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranchers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> newspaper El Universal. Insufficient moisture in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> still threatens non-irrigated fields and pastureland. Cattle losses in <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest state bordering <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, are into the thousands and large parts of the state bypassed the corn-planting season due to parched cropland. <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION> began importing cattle from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week. `` In other years farmers would be working intensely right now,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwedel </PERSON>, an agriculture economist in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, said <PERSON> Shwedel </PERSON>, `` They're staring at the sky.'' It has rained in the northeastern border state of <LOCATION> Nuevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION>, whose capital is <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. But the state government in this semi-arid industrial center announced this week a plan to seed clouds so to raise dam-water levels. De los <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> said 970,000 acres of cropland have been left barren, meaning production of soybean, rice, sorghum and corn will drop by 1.1 million tons in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> alone. `` We're talking about a loss of 15 billion pesos -LRB- $ 6.5 million -RRB- in direct salaries to workers,'' he said. Agriculture production on the northwestern desert lands depends largely on irrigation, but low water levels in the dams forced the cancellation of the spring planting season in some areas. All of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s soybeans, half the sorghum and most of the corn, beans and rice are planted during the spring cycle. De los <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> said the water supply in <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION>'s seven dams has fallen to 8 percent to 10 percent of total capacity. <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>'s 17 irrigation dams are down to about 25 percent of capacity, and the supply is dropping, said <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, president of the state <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. `` Cultivations of soybean and sesame have been restricted to almost zero in the entire <LOCATION> Yaqui </LOCATION> and Mayo valleys,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said. The two valleys total nearly 775,000 acres. <PERSON> Shwedel </PERSON> said the federal government's inflation-fighting program will face some tough challenges because of the drought. `` We're walking on a tightrope,'' he said. Under a plan to reduce inflation that hit a record 159 percent last year, the government has pledged to reduce spending and froze wages and prices of dozens of basic consumer goods. Although many crops have been salvaged, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> still is faced with spending $ 100 million to $ 700 million more than it did last year on imported food and feed, according to <PERSON> Shwedel </PERSON>. In 1987, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> spent $ 1.3 billion, he said.

<NOTE>EDs: Subs 5th graf, ``COSTS,'' to include cap on supplemental
premium</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are some highlights of the catastrophic health insurance bill signed into law by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday. HOSPITAL _ Full coverage for 365 days a year of hospital bills after a once-a-year deductible estimated at $ 564 in 1989. The deductible is indexed to rising hospital costs. Medicare now charges a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and provides full payment for just 59 days a year. DOCTOR BILLS _ Full payment of `` reasonable and proper'' doctor bills after a $ 1,370 annual cap is met. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> continues to pay 80 percent of charges, after a $ 75 deductible. Both the initial deductible and the 20 percent patient co-payment will count toward the $ 1,370 cap. Patient remains responsible for that portion of fees thatexceed the amount allowed by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. DRUGS _ <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs, after a $ 600 annual deductible, starting in 1991. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> pays 60 percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter, with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs. Medicare now has no across-the-board prescription drug coverage. COSTS _ To be paid solely by Medicare beneficiaries. Current Part B premium of $ 24.80 to increase by $ 4 a month in 1989. By 1993, the `` catastrophic'' monthly premium is projected at $ 10.20, in addition to whatever the regular Part B premium is at that time. More than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by an additional supplemental premium that is linked to federal income tax liability. The supplemental starts at $ 22.50 a year per $ 150 of tax liability in 1989, rising to $ 42 a year per $ 150 of tax liability in 1993. There is an $ 800 cap per covered person on the total supplemental premium in 1989, rising to $ 1,050 in 1993. NURSING HOME _ Expands number of days per year for skilled nursing facility care from 100 days to 150 and reduces co-payment from $ 67.50 a day after 20th day to $ 20.50 a day for first eight days, then none. No provision for long-term custodial care. RESPITE CARE _ 80 hours per year home health services to relieve unpaid care providers. This is a new benefit. HOME HEALTH CARE _ Expands present coverage of up to three weeks of care per illness for five days per week to up to 38 days of care per ilness for seven days per week. HOSPICE CARE _ Expands present 210 days per year to 365 days per year as long as patient is certified as terminally ill. MAMMOGRAMS _ A mammogram examination every other year for women over 65 This is a new benefit. Payment initially will be limited to $ 50. MEDICAID _ The bill phases in, over four years, a requirement that state Medicaid programs pay all Medicare premiums, deductibles and co-payments for the elderly and disabled with incomes below the federal poverty line but too high to qualify for Medicaid coverage. This improvement varies widely from state to state depending on what the state already does. SPOUSAL IMPOVERISHMENT _ Gradually raises the income that may be retained by a spouse remaining in the community when the husband or wife has to go to a nursing home at Medicaid expense. Starting Oct. 1, 1989, the spouse at home can keep at least $ 786 per month, or 122 percent of the federal poverty level for a two-person family. Spouse is also allowed to keep up to $ 12,000 in liquid assets.

 Cars packed with explosives blew up Friday on a busy block in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and near a Syrian army checkpoint in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, killing one person and injuring 52, police said. A spokesman for a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> splinter group, the Fatah-Uprising, blamed supporters of <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizaton </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> for the two blasts, which occurred 30 minutes apart. The first explosion sent flames shooting across west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s crowded <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, killing one person and injuring 32, a police spokesman said The street is west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s main commercial strip. The spokesman said a green <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> 12 rigged with 22 pounds of explosives went off at about 11:55 a.m. -LRB- 4:55 a.m. EDT -RRB- in front of the downtown Grand Hotel. The explosion shattered windows in the hotel and nearby buildings. Police could not confirm a state radio report that the person killed was the automobile's driver. They said most of the injured were treated at hospitals for wounds caused by flying glass and later released. Syrian soldiers fired their AK-47 automatic rifles in the air to make way for ambulances and fire engines and to disperse onlookers, many of them worried about family members who happened to be in the area. `` My 17-year-old son was in a nearby barber's shop. Was anyone hurt there?'' a frenzied woman asked a member of the local <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Syrian soldiers and intelligence agents also harassed journalists, hitting reporters with rifle butts, slapping photographers and confiscating cameras. Police earlier had defused a bomb found in a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> that had been parked near the <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> police barracks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s busy Mar Elias street, they said In the second blast, police said a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION> exploded 15 feet from a Syrian army checkpoint in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley town of <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elias </LOCATION>. Two Syrian soldiers were among the 20 wounded. Police said the car was packed with about 44 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> and blew up about 12:25 p.m. -LRB- 5:25 a.m. EDT -RRB-. The explosion set four other cars on fire, police said. The explosions, the seventh and eighth car bombings in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year, came nine days after a similar explosion killed one person and wounded 18 others in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian district of <LOCATION> Karantina </LOCATION>. By police count, the previous six car bombings killed 94 people and wounded 251. There have been no claims of responsibility for any of the bombings. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the spokesman for the Syria-backed <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> blamed the car bombings on <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. `` Such criminal acts are directed against the Syrian army and its national role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' Col. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Nashnash </PERSON> said in a statement, and were designed to `` create tension in other areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Earlier, the leader of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying that all <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas would be driven from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was trying to create an independent province in the southern port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> troops evacuated the <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Tuesday and went to <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>'s followers overran the devastated area Monday. Fatah-Uprising is besieging the shantytown of <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Barajneh </PERSON> on the city's southern edge. `` <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is currently seeking to concentrate his forces in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> to create a canton ... but he will fail there as he had failed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an interview published Friday in the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily Ad-Diyar. <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> broke away from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, in 1983 and set up headquarters for <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the Syrian capital. By police count 127 people have been killed and 527 wounded since the latest round of fighting for control ofr two <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> camps broke out May 1.

 <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> became <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s top political official Friday and warned that the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> still remains under military threat from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc despite Soviet efforts at reform. The former West German defense minister spoke to reporters shortly after taking over from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> as the alliance's secretary-general. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, 53, is the first West German to hold the post since the alliance was formed in 1949. `` We face a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> policy that inspires many hopes but has not given any tangible indication that its military effort will slacken,'' he said. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> called on the Soviets and their East European allies to follow what he called the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s example of maintaining only the military forces needed for defensive purposes `` That would be a decisive new turn for the foreign and security policy of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and conclusive evidence of the well-publicized ` new thinking in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact,''' he said. His comments echoed those of Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s supreme military commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, who warned the West not to be lulled into a false sense of security by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, speaking to a group of American reporters today in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has shown no change in military policy. `` I see a lot of wishful thinking, a lot of romanticism, about the way things are going,'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said. `` On the military side.. I can find nothing really that has changed.'' The two spoke as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet inspectors traveled to each other's countries to begin the task of verifying compliance with the superpower intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty signed in December. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> is the seventh <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general. The appointment holds no fixed term. Fluent in English and French, he holds a doctorate in international law and served as a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> member of the Bundestag, or West German parliament, for 23 years before resigning this year to take the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> appointment. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s defense minister for nearly six years. As <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> is chairman of the main decision-making bodies, including the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinate the members' national policies The secretary-general also heads an international staff of 1,500. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> for his first official visit to a member country. Last fall, after <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> announced his plans to retire, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> prime minister <PERSON> Kaare </PERSON> <PERSON> Willoch </PERSON> engaged in a rare public contest for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> appointment.

 The man who may become the nation's foreign minister said Friday it should be <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy to deport <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists and to open fire on rioters to crush the 7-month-old rebellion in the occupied lands. A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> woman died of gunshot wounds to the head suffered in an army raid on her village May 18, said officials at <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Only a harsh crackdown can restore <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ability to deter revolt among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Benyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, a former ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and a leading candidate in the November parliamentary election. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> could be the next foreign minister if his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc wins the election. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and the rival center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> share a tenuous `` national unity'' coalition and recent polls show them running even in the election campaign. Soldiers shot <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassem </PERSON>, 24, during a raid on <PERSON> Abwein </PERSON>, an isolated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> mountain village, and killed another villager, the hospital officials said. Her death brought to 214 the number of Palestinians killed since violence began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. Four Israelis also have been slain. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should `` expel the main core of inciters who plan, organize and execute the riots. ... We are talking about hundreds of people.'' Thousands of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists have been arrested in the past seven months, but <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said prison terms no longer serve as a deterrent. Local leaders are replaced as soon as they are arrested, he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s expulsion of 21 Arabs has brought condemnation from abroad, including criticism by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who say the action violates international law and human rights conventions. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> told Israeli reporters Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> spent several minutes censuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> when four Arabs were expelled earlier this year, and said the censure would last only a few minutes more if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> depoarted hundreds. He resigned as ambassador four months ago to become a candidate. The former ambassador told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> on Friday authorities must let soldiers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians shoot with `` intent to neutralize'' Arabs throwing stones and firebombs. He said it should be <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s declared policy to open fire on Arabs throwing firebombs and rocks. `` If a rioter throws a firebomb, he should know he could be shot to death,'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> declared. `` The vast majority of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> voters favors much tougher measures, and this cuts across the political spectrum.'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said the policy must be valid for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and Jewish settlers alike. `` Settlers should be allowed to use force to protect their lives,'' he said. He also demanded more restrictions on television camera crews, contending that their presence feeds the violence, but said the restrictions should not apply to print and radio reporters. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> already puts severe limits on media access, frequently declaring sites of violence to be closed military areas. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, has said the violence must stop before peace talks can begin, but also favors trading occupied territory for peace. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opposes territorial concessions. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, said Friday the rebellion's aim goes beyond ending the occupation to a `` confrontation over everything: our existence, our independence.'' He said domestic debates over territorial compromise weaken <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s negotiating position. A report in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the Arab revolt had caused several diplomatic setbacks for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Quoting sources in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, it said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> retreated from plans to raise the level of relations, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> decided not to open an embassy in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> refused to accept a resident <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> had decided not to open an embassy because of the uprising, but said he did not know if that was the reason for decisions by the other countries.

Friday's attacks raised to seven the number of sabotage incidents this year suspected to have been conducted against companies involved in the expansion of the airport. Farmers and radical opponents have clashes with police over the years to protest the airport and more recently the construction of two new runways.

 Rapid economic growth pushed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate down in May to its lowest level in 37 months, while the number of job holders hit a record 61.06 million, the government announced Friday.

<HEAD>Democrats Want High-Tech Look, Down to Balloons and Bunting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even the balloons and bunting are supposed to have a high-tech look at this month's Democratic National Convention. `` We want the people to see this thing as an organized, unified convention _ people who've got their act together,'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, deputy chief executive officer for the July 18-21 event, said in an interview Friday. Bold tones of red, white and blue will be replaced by `` soft blues, soft reds and gray tones'' on the podium. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said this `` more futuristic look'' will be used around The Omni and, to some degree, will replace traditional bunting. `` It's not exactly bunting,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said of the decorations planned for the skyboxes for VIPs. But he promised plenty of color using paint, bunting and flags. Balloons in some entry areas will take the form of `` air tubes,'' thick air-filled creations `` that will be intertwined in some of the architectural structures,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign has yet to set final plans for the demonstration following his acceptance speech, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> suggested balloons wo n't simply drop from nets. `` There are a lot of different ways to use balloons these days _ balloon structures, different ways of releasing them,'' he said. Still, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> promised the celebration of the nominee will include `` lots of flags, confetti, balloons, noisemakers, lots of traditional things.'' Less dramatic moments in the convention are being planned with an eye toward projecting a calm, uncluttered image, a main goal of the podium design. In past conventions, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said, `` there were always a lot of people walking behind the speaker and everything. We just wanted to eliminate a lot of that.'' So only a handful of convention officials will have seats on the main speakers' platform, and they will not be in the line of prime camera angles. Party staffers will be seated with reporters beside the platform. Above, two giant screens will project closed-circuit views of the speaker, promotional films or graphics illustrating speeches, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. For the first time, the party will broadcast floor proceedings and interviews with various officials over a satellite feed, making it available to anyone with a satellite dish. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, the convention's chief executive officer, has said previously the convention's futuristic look will be enhanced by the computer terminals which will be used to record and count many preliminary votes. The traditional roll calls for the presidential and vice presidential candidates still will be held, however.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s new secretary general, has a dapper and often combative style that led to a fashion magazine cover and scandal over the firing of a general falsely accused of homosexual contacts. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s seventh general secretary since the post was created in 1952, took over the alliance's highest civilian post on Friday. He was the first West German appointed to the post. The 53-year-old former West German defense minister replaces <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Lord <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, who held the job since June 1984. His appointment followed a failed bid by <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to have its former prime minister, <PERSON> Kaare </PERSON> <PERSON> Willoch </PERSON>, named to the post. Nominees are generally agreed upon in negotiations between the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies, and the tussle sparked a rare public dispute that embarrassed officials at the alliance's <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> headquarters. Early in his political career, the former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> air force pilot created a dashing image for himself. He was often photographed climbing into the cockpit of a Fiat G91 fighter or relaxing in sports cars. During his parlimentary career, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> retained his reputation as a stylish public official with a knack for oratory. In 1977, the Duesseldorf-based <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON> men's fashion magazine featured him in a cover photo and story. But the air force reserve colonel is also known for his penchant for combativeness and controversy. In a 1970 budget speech to the Bundestag, or West German parliament, his attacks on the then-governing Social Democratic government were so stinging that former Chancellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> stormed out of the session. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> was also the subject of intense public debate in 1983 and early 1984 over a widely publicized scandal involving his firing of a top <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> general, <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiessling </PERSON>. The defense minister dismissed the West German general following reports that alleged he had frequented homosexual bars in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>. The rumors were subsequently proven false, forcing <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> to reinstate <PERSON> Kiessling </PERSON> one month after his dismissal. During the scandal, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> survived repeated calls for his resignation by opposition leaders. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, the son of a prosperous textile retailer. As a child, he belonged to the <LOCATION> Jungvolk </LOCATION>, a junior branch of the Hitler Youth organization. He has a doctorate in international law and was voted into the Bundestag in 1965. He served four years as the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' party chairman and has been a member of its national executive committee since 1973 <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> was defense minister for nearly six years. He is fluent in English and French, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s official languages. The new <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secretary has said he regards narrowing the Soviet superiority in conventional arms as the key challenge for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. He is also a proponent of plans for closer Franco-West German defense cooperation and opposes the withdrawal of all nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> auditioned Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> for vice president Friday before a cheering homestate crowd and said he rather liked `` dull and boring'' _ a description sometimes attached to both men. After his joint appearance with the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> senator to wind up a quick <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> campaign trip, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for a holiday weekend that will be capped by a Fourth of July dinner with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, celebrating his mother's 87th birthday. He planned to spend the holiday campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. As he approached the final two weeks before the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had his party's presidential nomination firmly in hand and was deep into the business of choosing a running mate, a process he was determined to keep as closed to scrutiny as possible When pressed for a vice presidential preference, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeatedly offered no hint of his choice and said he would `` make a decision when I'm ready to make a decision.'' He told reporters in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> that he expected to notify those he does n't choose before making any public announcement. `` I generally have the practice of notifying people I do n't pick,'' he said Might <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> receive such notice over dinner on Monday? <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> shook his head from side to side. `` We're going to have dinner and listen to some good music,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON>, to join him and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, for a holiday dinner at their home in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and then attend a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Pops concert. <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>, is a former associated conductor of the orchestra. Meanwhile, Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said he doubted <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would press to be the vice presidential nominee. `` Every poll I've seen shows that the only instance in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is losing to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on the ticket,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is n't suicidal and neither is <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The last thing he wants to be is the vice presidential nominee on a losing ticket.'' As for <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the senator would be `` extraordinarily valuable to the ticket.'' Twice during his <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> trip he shared a platform with a local favorite and each time he gave the crowd a teasing hint that their choice might also be his. With Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> standing by during an appearance in Terre Haute, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` Somebody handed me a button, ` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>.' That has kind of a nice ring to it, does n't it?'' The crowd responded with a cheer. Twelve hours later he was in an auto workers union hall in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> sitting across a stage from <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, the former astronaut who is the state's senior senator. `` I've been taking a poll all over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> about running mates,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` What do you think about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>?'' The crowd erupted with loud cheers and whistles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> turned to the senator and shook his hand. Returning to the microphone, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor added, `` Sounds unanimous to me.'' At a news conference after his speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if he agreed with assessments that <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> was `` dull and boring'' and had run a disastrous campaign for president four years ago. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, standing behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, grinned and blushed. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> smiled. `` Dull and boring,'' said the candidate, whose has heard those words used to describe him. `` I kind of like that.'' As for the rap against <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>'s 1984 campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` I've won campaigns and I've lost campaigns; I've run good campaigns and have had one disastrous campaign. So I'm very sympathetic.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lost the governor's office in 1978 but rebounded in 1982 and was resoundingly re-elected in 1986. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> refused to comment on whether he deserved to be called dull and boring. In fact, at the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> hall, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> was positively animated compared to <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> the night before. A highly respected member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> who was a senior member of the special committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> has a professorial speaking style. He hardly moved while sharing the stage with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> entered the union hall he drew louder applause than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Smiling broadly, the senator gave a double thumbs up sign to the crowd and then pointed to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who also looked happy with the crowd reaction.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday proclaimed the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference a success. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke after the conference of 5,000 party members adopted resolutions in what the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency called an `` unusually stormy and long'' debate. The conference formally closed after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s address, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviet Communist Party leader called for construction of a monument to the victims of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, saying, `` I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be constructed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, summing up the work of the four-day conference, said `` the conference has created the necessary impetus to perestroika, deepening of perestroika and the guarantee of its irreversibility.'' Referring to his proposals to restructure the Soviet government, strengthening its legislative branch and giving the president new powers, the Soviet leader said `` the conference will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform the political system.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the conference adopted a packet of six resolutions, saying the debate on bureaucracy, inter-ethnic relations, and glasnost, were particularly thorny. It did not immediately say what the resolutions said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also gave a lengthy critique of the work of former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who appealed to the conference earlier in the day to absolve him of blame for his criticism of the slow pace of reform. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s criticisms cost him his job and his spot on the ruling Politburo. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was chosen to run the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party organization because of his experience and energy but ultimately proved he could not handle the job. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> praised the open atmosphere of the conference. `` One of the heroes of our conference was glasnost because our conference was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is being reflected in our society. We also discussed its limits,'' he said. He called on the Soviet media to `` publicize the real achievements of the real heroes of perestroika,'' and proclaimed that no one has a monopoly on the truth. In an apparent reference to the time of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, he said `` the printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism.'' In contrast, he said the conference had showed how the interparty debate must be carried out.

<HEAD>Meeting of Opposition, Government Officials Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lower-ranking government officials and intellectuals linked to the banned trade union Solidarity met secretly this week to try to reopen dialogue stymied since the imposition of martial law in 1981. The discussions, which one participant described as `` in the nature of a first meeting,'' focused on the possibility of an `` anti-crisis pact'' in which the two sides would unite behind a program to end the country's economic crisis. `` It was certainly a success that this meeting took place,'' according to the participant, referring to the virtual absence of direct talks between the government and opposition in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since the imposition of martial law in 1981. Martial law was lifted in 1983, but opposition groups including the Solidarity trade union remain officially banned. The four-hour meeting Tuesday took place with the knowledge of Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Politiburo </PERSON> member <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Czyrek </PERSON>, said a source familiar with the event. He said it might lead to meetings with participation of higher-ranking officials. The participant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the meeting ended with a decision for a later meeting that `` would be more concrete, devoted to selected problems.'' No date was set. About 25 people were invited by <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Goliszewski </PERSON>, editor of the monthly newspaper Konfrontacja -LRB- Confrontation -RRB-, and its editorial board. The publication, linked with the official national unity organization PRON, began publishing in January and has been promoting the anti-crisis pact idea. <PERSON> Goliszewski </PERSON> confirmed he called the meeting. Other sources from the opposition and the official side, demanding anonymity, provided details to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Among those reported attending from the opposition were Solidarity advisers <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugaj </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Stelmachowski </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intellectuals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Paszynski </PERSON>, head of a nationwide association of private entrepreneurs which has applied for official recognition. From the authorities were Col. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON>, head of the government public opinion polling center <PERSON> Mariusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulczynski </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and Law of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, and a parliamentary communist party leader, <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojna </PERSON>, the sources said. The meeting was known to be controversial within the opposition, which is wary of being used. One Roman Catholic intellectual, lawyer <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, said he stayed away because, `` I thought it was n't wise to hold such a meeting at this time.'' `` There were no politicians, there was no <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>,'' said the participant, referring to Solidarity chief <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. Of the representatives from the official side, he said, `` They are important advisers, but of lower rank.'' `` The discussion was definitely a political one ... An outlining of positions or stands,'' he said. `` And I think that the next meeting will be more pragmatic or technical.'' The sources said some of the participants insisted it not be publicized. It took place on `` neutral grounds,'' a hall at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he said. The source familiar with the meeting said it was an opportunity for the government to poll a broad spectrum of the opposition on what solutions it might accept to solve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems. The nation was hit by a wave of strikes last month and there has been little public enthusiasm for government economic reform steps, including steep price increases, to save <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s debt-burdened and inefficient economy. `` Both sides expressed approval of the need for rapid changes in the economy,'' the source said. `` But the opposition stressed the opinion that the changes have to be very radical.'' The most emotional discussion was reported to focus on trade unions, with the opposition demanding legalization of Solidarity, a suggestion rejected by the officials. The opposition side said it was willing to hear other government proposals that would create `` trade union pluralism,'' the source said. The sides agreed on the desirability of independent associations, political discussion clubs and a `` coalition'' form of governing in which `` representatives of independent circles'' would enter the government and the parliament, the source said. But the officials taking part in the discussion said they had no authority to make firm offers and would have to consult with their superiors, while the opposition stressed that it was not interested in `` artificial'' actions from the government or attempts to split its ranks, said the source. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> proposed talks on an `` anti-crisis pact'' in an interview published by <PERSON> Konfrontacja </PERSON> earlier this year. Czyrek, the Politburo member, repeated the formulation in an interview published in May. However the two sides have been at odds publically over what the pact would cover and who would be the government's negotiating partner. Officials have said the government could not talk to groups paid by a foreign power, or people who want the situation in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to worsen, descriptions normally applied by the official media to Solidarity. The source said such language was absent from Tuesday's meeting.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship severely damaged by an Iranian mine on April 14 slipped quietly out of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on Friday aboard a larger vessel and headed for repairs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The missile frigate USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was being carried aboard the Dutch heavy lift ship, Mighty Servant II, a 25,743-ton semi-submersible cargo vessel that was to take 30 days to carry the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> to its home port of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> For security reasons, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would not say when the ship departed <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> and when it passed through the Strait of <PERSON> Hormuz </PERSON> at the mouth of the gulf. Before the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> was hit, it was on duty in the gulf escorting merchant shipping which has been a target of attacks in the 8-year Iran-Iraq war. The commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the region, Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, declined during a meeting with reporters on Thursday to discuss the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' movements, but he warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> against trying to attack the stricken vessel. `` Let them just try,'' he said. The <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> hit a submerged mine on April 14 after stumbling into what <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said was a newly laid minefield 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had sewn the mines. The blast wounded 10 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors and ripped a 25-foot gash in the hull of the 445-foot long, 3,600-ton frigate. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces retaliated by attacking two Iranian oil platforms April 18, starting a day of fighting in which six Iranian naval craft were sunk or damaged. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said Iranian attacks against merchant shipping in the gulf had dropped off after April 18. However, he said the Iranians were continuing work on a permanent bunker for <ORGANIZATION> Silkwork </ORGANIZATION> anti-ship missiles at <LOCATION> Kuhe-Stak </LOCATION>, which overlooks the narrow Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. The frigate USS Vincennes, equipped with advanced Aegis radar and anti-missile missiles, has been posted near the strait with orders to protect merchant ships from attacks by the Chinese-made Silkworms. About 30 of the <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' sailors were accompanying the ship home. About 140 other crewmen returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week.

<TEXT>
 Wheat and barley farmers this month will get about $ 190 million as final settlement for participating in last year's federal price support programs, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The subsidies are `` emergency compensation'' or so-called <PERSON> Findley </PERSON> payments under the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s price support apparatus. The payments will be in cash and will be issued `` as soon as possible'' through local offices of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, head of the agency. Wheat farmers will get about $ 170 million and barley producers about $ 20 million. The final wheat payments are based on a rate of 9 \ cents per bushel, and barley at 5 cents per bushel Last January wheat farmers collected $ 335 million in advance <ORGANIZATION> Findley </ORGANIZATION> payments, which are the the result of an amendment by former Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Findley </PERSON>, R-Ill.

<TEXT>
 A former governor's declaration of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> as a sanctuary state was vague enough to be construed as carrying the weight of law, and a journalist and minister can use it as a defense against alien smuggling charges, a judge has ruled. Then-Gov. <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON> declared <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a sanctuary in 1986, a largely symbolic action aimed at people fleeing war in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It was rescinded when Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> took office in January 1987. <PERSON> Demetria </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a free-lance religion writer, and the Rev. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Remer-Thamert </PERSON>, a Lutheran minister, were indicted by a federal grand jury in December on charges of conspiring to smuggle two pregnant Salvadoran women into the country in 1986. The minister contends he tried to help the women because of his religious beliefs and because he considered them to be refugees fleeing a war-torn country. He also maintains the women were to put their babies up for adoption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they feared conditions in their homeland. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office has said Remer-Thamert was motivated by a so-called adoption-for-profit scheme. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has maintained she accompanied Remer-Thamert in her role as a journalist and should never have been indicted. Prosecutors have tried to prevent the minister from using his religious beliefs as a defense. They also have tried to prevent both defendants from using the sanctuary declaration. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> ruled Thursday the pair should not be prohibited from offering evidence `` which could arguably show that the defendants reasonably relied upon the proclamation.'' `` The proclamation, while interesting, never mentions the fact that it is symbolic only,'' <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> wrote. Trial is scheduled July 13.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday night closed a national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference on his program of `` perestroika,'' saying resolutions endorsed by the delegates lead the way to a `` democratic image of socialism.'' The four-day conference, the first held by the party since 1941, was unprecedented in the openness of criticism of past and present leaders. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pointed out one key to the four-day conference _ the attempt to overcome the party's Stalinist legacy _ when he called for construction of a monument to the victims <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. `` I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be constructed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' he said in his closing address. `` This would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke after the conference of 5,000 party members adopted resolutions in what the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency called an `` unusually stormy and long'' debate. The meeting, which was called by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to pass judgment on his 3-year-old policy of restructuring Soviet society, formally closed after his address. The Soviet leader also engaged in a long critique of the work of former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who appealed earlier in the day to the conference to absolve him of blame for criticizing the pace of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms last fall. That criticism cost <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> his job and his spot as a candidate member of the ruling Politburo. Summing up the work of the conference, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` Through democratization, economic reform and changes in the political system we willmake perestroika irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state of our society, a new human and democratic image of socialism.'' He called for the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and other organs to urgently settle questions related to political reforms so they can begin to be implemented at a fall session of the Supreme Soviet. Referring to his proposals to restructure the government's legislative branch and give the president new powers, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` the conference will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform the political system. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the conference adopted a package of six resolutions, saying the debate on bureaucracy, inter-ethnic relations and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or more openness, were particularly thorny. It did not say what the resolutions said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report said there were several votes on amendments, and that the conference rejected proposals by space scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeyev </PERSON> on elections to government councils. An amendment calling for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda to be taken out of the hands of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> received only 56 votes, it said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> praised the open atmosphere of the conference. `` One of the heroes of our conference was glasnost because our conference was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is being reflected in our society. We also discussed its limits,'' he said. He called on the Soviet media to `` publicize the real achievements of the real heroes of perestroika,'' and proclaimed that no one has a monopoly on the truth. In an apparent reference to the time of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, he said `` the printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism.'' In contrast, he said the conference had showed how the interparty debate must be carried out. Before the conference debate ended, however, the long-simmering feud between <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and Kremlin No. 2 leader <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> broke into the open. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was judged as being politically mistaken by the party, but he said Friday his only mistake was poor timing. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was chosen to run the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party organization because of his experience and energy, but ultimately proved he could not handle the job. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, at whom much of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s criticism was leveled, took the floor Friday evening to oppose his return, saying <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> committed many errors and still had n't learned his lesson. The 57-year-old <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a leading reformer and former protege of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, was fired from his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> job as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after he attacked the slow pace of reform during a speech in October to the Central Committee. The speech has not been published. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was reassigned as first deputy of the state construction committee, a ministerial-level post. He was dropped from the Politburo in February but retained sufficient status in the party to be chosen a delegate. `` I think my only mistake was that I spoke too early, before the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. It was a time when the party was trying to display unity and celebrate its successes. `` Taking to heart what happened, I ask the conference to change the decision of the plenum of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the delegates. `` If you find it possible to do this, you will rehabilitate me in the eyes of Communists.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> took the floor to answer questions from many delegates about the circumstances of his ouster and about his demand that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> resign. He had told Western reporters during the U.S.-Soviet summit meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was the party official most responsible for holding back <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> had `` not drawn the necessary conclusions from his mistakes and the principled criticism of his party comrades.'' Other delegates also criticized <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, charging that he had been tactless on a visit abroad and gave interviews to foreign new agencies just to boost his own prestige. Some rose to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s defense in an open debate Earlier Friday, the nation's top environmental official demanded punishment for planners responsible for pollution disasters, and a reformist publisher defended the new openness of the press. At other times during the conference, delegates have openly disagreed on the concrete results of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for perestroika, which was launched after he took power in March 1985.

 <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> is unable to walk and spends most of her time on her front porch, praying, reading the Bible and waiting to die among the squalor of her rundown home. A health official said Friday he does not want to do anything to take away her right to do what she wants. Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON>, 88, said she does not want or need anything else. `` When you get as old as I am you have to be satisfied,'' she said. `` There's a time to put down all the stuff you picked up in your young life and get ready to meet <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>.'' She said she does n't want to leave her porch, where she's been for three weeks, because that's where she wants to die.

A.L. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> has tried to persuade Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> to allow someone to help her. He wants to get her to a hospital to find out why she ca n't walk. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> called the wood frame house a death trap. It has no electricity, gas or running water. `` If she was a dog, the humane society would have been over there to do something for her,'' he said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said some of her five stepchildren in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are to arrive this weekend, and he hopes they will take her with them. But Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffreys </PERSON> said she barely knows her stepchildren and would rather stay at the house where she has lived since 1935. Her husband died in 1940. <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montevallo </LOCATION> said she took Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> into her home for three months after learning in January that the woman's feet were badly swollen. Mrs. <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said a doctor `` gave her two prescriptions, but she said that if she could go home she could use a home remedy.'' After the swelling went down Mrs. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> insisted on going home.

Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> also said the current announced withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> of 50,000 Vietnamese occupation soldiers, including senior command elements, `` if fully implemented would represent a positive step toward stability in the region.'' She added, however, that `` the announced withdrawal would still leave in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> at leaart 50,000 to 70,000 Vietnamese troops whose presence would prevent any genuine expression of Cambodian political self-determination.'' `` We continue to maintain that the resolution of the Cambodian problem would require a settlement agreement which provides for complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 A juvenile court's decision to return two young children to a home with a `` severe and prolongued'' history of child abuse must be reconsidered, the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. In a 5-2 decision, the state's high court said the child abuse documented in 1982 `` is almost incredible'' and sent the case back to <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> juvenile court for further findings. `` The history of child abuse in the home has been both severe and prolonged,'' Associate Justice <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said in the majority opinion. In 1982, the father was convicted of second-degree assault for physical abuse against his seven children, who range in age from 8 to 20. In 1983, a juvenile court judge found that he had sexually abused the two youngest children, court documents state. But a juvenile court ruled last year that the two youngest children, who had been in foster care since 1982, should be returned to the home anyway. The five older children had already returned to their parents, the court said. The dissenting judges said that instead of merely studying the case further, the courts should terminate the parents' rights to the youngest children immediately. `` The courts have exercised judicial caution long enough,'' Justice <PERSON> Rosalie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wahl </PERSON> said. `` It is unconscionable to prolong these proceedings.'' According to court documents in a 1982 order taking the children from him, the father once forced several of the children to stand on stools and placed a chain that had been positioned over a roof beam around their necks as he threatened to kick the stool from underneath each child. On other occasions, the father chased a child with a bowie knife and held it to the child's throat, the documents state. He also once ordered several children outside, clad only in their nightgowns, when the wind-chill was 80 degrees below zero. The mother also was physically abused by the father, according to court documents. Friday's order stems from a July 1987 juvenile court ruling that denied a social services petition to terminate parental rights for the two youngest children. The five older children had testified at that time that conditions in the home had improved, the court said. But the ruling noted that the testimony `` came from children who for most of their lives had been physically abused by their father and who had themselves never volunteered to report the continued abuse.''

 The kickoff Friday of the 125th anniversary observance of the Battle of <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> thrilled <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> for a very personal reason: His father fought in it. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 70, a retired career <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer, drove in from <LOCATION> Sanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for the ceremonies. He wore the uniform of a Union colonel as he watched mock soldiers pass in review to mark the start of the battle, which was fought here July 1-3, 1863. His father, Pvt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, fought with the 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> and later was wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, whose father was in his 70s when he was born, was the only known first-generation descendant at the national park, where what many historians view as the central battle of the Civil War took place. The opening event drew only about 1,000 spectators, well below park officials' estimates that 20,000 or more visitors would be at the battlefield for each day of the anniversary. Last weekend, more than 100,000 visitors attended a three-day re-enactment of the battle on private property several miles from this <LOCATION> Adams </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community. `` I do think that a lot of people think last week was the actual anniversary,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the battlefield park's media director. `` I think some people mistakenly thought that once the events of last week were over, that that was the end of it.'' The first day's schedule mirrored the first day of the battle. Not much happened. But just as the fighting intensified on the second day and reached its climax with the Union victory on the third, the pace of events will pick up Saturday and Sunday, with a symbolic exchange of battle flags, a dedication of the newest monument at the battlefield and a relighting of the Eternal Peace Light Memorial. `` Obviously, Friday and Saturday are when the people are hopefully going to be here,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. The last time there were overflow crowds in <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> was 1938, the 75th anniversary of the clash between Union and Confederate troops. That was the last major reunion of soldiers who fought here. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was here then with his father, who was in his mid-90s. He remembers touring the battlefield and being able to envision what happened. But he said he did n't hear much about the battle from his father or the other veterans. `` He did n't talk too much about it,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. `` Most of the veterans would n't talk too much about it. I guess they wanted to forget.'' Those who turned out Friday were quickly gripped by the fascination of the once bloody ground, later the scene of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s famous Gettsyburg Address. `` We've come a long way to see this,'' said Londoner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Funnell </PERSON>. `` It's fantastic.'' His wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, agreed, but said she was still hoping for one more thrill at <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>. `` I would like to see something like <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>,'' she said, referring to the dashing character in `` Gone With The Wind.''

 An Amish farmer who won a new pickup truck in a grocery store contest will trade it in for a horse-drawn buggy because the truck does n't fit into his religion's simple lifestyle. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON> won the fire-engine-red <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION>, worth $ 7,500, when his name was drawn from hundreds of thousands of entries last month in a Village Market Food Centers drawing in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. The farmer, who operates 105 acres with his brother outside this town of 1,000, learned that he had won Wednesday when the owner of the local Village Market store, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murk </PERSON>, drove out to his farm. <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON> does n't have a telephone, in keeping with Amish custom of dressing simply and spurning modern conveniences like phones and electrical appliances. <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON> was surprised at winning, <PERSON> Murk </PERSON> said. But `` everybody envisions what they'd do with something if they won. I think he had in mind buying himself a new surrey, buggy, whatever you want to call it.'' <PERSON> Hostetler </PERSON> should have some money left over once he trades in the pickup. <PERSON> Murk </PERSON> said a new carriage should cost $ 1,800 to $ 3,000.

<TEXT>
 Pilot error most likely caused the collision of two Army helicopters that killed 17 soldiers during night training at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION> last March, according to a report released Friday. `` Pilot error, to wit, a reasonable mistake in judgment is the most probable explanation for the cause of this accident,'' said the report, compiled by an investigation board of six <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> officers, all aviators. But the report concluded: `` There should be no action taken against anyone as no foundation for negligence can be established. The accident was not due to lack of diligence, nor unreasonable or unprofessional conduct.'' `` Up to the point of impact, the missions were formed just as briefed,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON>, public affairs officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base. The report said there was no evidence of a mechanical malfunction in the two UH-60 Black Hawks involved in the March 8 crash. `` Nor can it be confirmed that there were any procedural errors on the part of either crew,'' <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. The report, however, cited other factors, including exterior and interior design features of the UH-60 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> and limited pilot training with night-vision goggles. Compounding the problem, the report said, was the lack of lighting on the helicopters. The report said the number and the size of position lights on the outside of the $ 4.6 million Black Hawk are inadequate. The helicopters were made by <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, company spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stangrone </PERSON> said the company not seen the report. But he said: `` All aircraft have some degree of field-of-view limitation. Obviously, the ideal cockpit is a glass bubble with an unobstructed view. It's a matter of design tradeoffs that consider structural integrity, ballistic tolerance, survivability and so on. ... Design and operational tradeoffs also determine the extent and intensity of exterior aircraft lighting.'' The investigation found that the collision `` was the result of the two air crews' being unable to see each other in the final moments of flight,'' according to a statement read by <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON>. The report said one of the two helicopters may not have had its anti-collision strobe light turned on as required. `` That's the only item in question _ the strobe light,'' <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. `` Because the accident was fatal to the crew of both aircraft, it is impossible to determine exactly what caused the two aircraft to fly into each other,'' the report said. The accident occurred when a Black Hawk returning from a solo instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in a formation of three returning from a mission to pick up soldiers in the field. The lead helicopter, struck broadside, carried 13 soldiers. The other carried four. All 17 victims, who belonged to the 101st Airborne Division at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Campbell </LOCATION>, were killed. The other two helicopters landed safely. Crew members on the undamaged helicopters said there was little warning that another helicopter was approaching. The pilots were wearing night-vision goggles, which amplify very small amounts of light. `` Restrictions to vision caused by door posts and structural components of the aircraft and the limited field of view of the night-vision goggles being used by both crews hampered their ability to see,'' <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said at the news conference. The report did specifically cite the door posts. The lights on the helicopter leading the formation could `` very easily have been obscured and blended into'' city lights, he added. Pilots wearing night goggles are supposed to scan left and right repeatedly because the goggles provide only a 40-degree field of view, <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. One of the helicopters involved in the crash was in a climbing right-hand turn with its crew members looking to the right as it turned while the crew members of the other helicopter to the left were looking straight ahead, <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. The helicopter making the right turn `` would have been slightly nose up, left wing high ... so the field of vision to the left would have been obscured,'' <PERSON> Schoel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stangrone </PERSON> said one effort being made to enhance cockpit visibility is smaller instrument panels that allow for a larger wind screen. `` This effort is paced by computer technology that will result in smaller black boxes and instrument displays,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> announced today that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has suspended payment on $ 1 billion in contracts that may have been tainted by bribes and fraud. The suspensions will not damage national security, he said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said that he took the action as a result of documents in the case unsealed by a judge in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The affidavits disclosed that a defense consultant passed along inside information on nine <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts worth more than $ 522 million in a conversation that was monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Additionally, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the department was beginning suspension procedures against three individuals and a company named in the documents, reviewing existing contracts with four implicated companies, and freezing new contracts on nine weapons systems. `` The affidavit provides the department with evidence concerning individuals and companies,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has initiated suspension procedures with respect to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'' and the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the companies and officials involved were being notified of the Petagon action. And he said the department would take further actions as evidence in the case becomes public. ` Wherever we have specific evidence, we will take action. As I have indicated previously, we do not need to wait -LRB- for -RRB- convictions, or even trials, for that matter,'' he said. `` We are in an ongoing dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>,'' which is conducting the investigation, he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> quite correctly points out that what they are dealing with is grand jury information, and -LRB- it -RRB- would be inappropriate for them to supply this information to us at this time. But as soon as they are able to, they will be supplying information to us, and as soon as we get the information, we will act.'' Until Pentagon officials see what is in other affidavits in the case, he said, `` until we have all the information from the Deparment of Justice, we ca n't make ... judgements. All we can do is wait for the wheels of justice to take their course.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the current actions did not gravely impair national security, but that additional suspensions might. `` If you say ` impact on national security', clearly anything that slows down the process of producing defense equipment or requires us to reopen contracts has an impact on our ability to get equipment in the field,'' he said. `` If you are talking about grave or serious impact on readiness or modernization programs, I would not yet put what we have done today in that category. But clearly it has an impact,'' he said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the Pentagon was reviewing existing contracts with four companies named in the affidavit, <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Norden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hazeltine </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Emhart </ORGANIZATION>. Of the four, only <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> has been named by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> as among the top 100 companies with which it does buiness. The largest single weapons system on which payments are being frozen is called the Anti-Submarine Operating Center, a $ 712 million system of shore-based command and control centers to coorinate efforts to locate, and in time of war destroy, submarines. The second most costly weapons system mentioned by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terminal </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 150 million program to develop a hand-held computerized unit to compose messages to be transmitted in short bursts by military field radios to minimize the possibility that they could be intercepted or decoded by enemy forces. The next largest was the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 118 million program to replace existing installations that used advanced electronics to coordinate air defenses. The other six weapons systems on which new contract actions were being suspended were: the Tactical Environmental Support System, a $ 58 million <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> program; a $ 51 million fiber optical project; the <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wideband </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> set, being developed at a cost of $ 49 million; a $ 38 million anti-submarine warfare electronics display unit; the $ 30 million <ORGANIZATION> Bancroft </ORGANIZATION> radio for tanks and the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' light armored vehicles; and a $ 6.3 million project to develop very low frequency and low frequency communications gear.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> began his four-month sentence for selling a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover officer by reporting to jail Friday before being put under house arrest. <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, 24-year-old son of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, was booked at <ORGANIZATION> Chittenden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and then left to begin a special house arrest program for non-violent criminals. `` He's come and gone,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scripture </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chittenden </PERSON> superintendent. `` He was processed, fingerprinted, photographed and left at 2:30. We treated this as a routine booking.'' After booking, <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> was to be released to the field supervision officer to participate in the state's house arrest program. `` It's like being in jail, but without the walls,'' said Scripture, adding that <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> would be required to stay in his residence. `` He would have a schedule whereby he could leave for work or community service. He would not be allowed to consume alcohol or drugs, and parole officers would stop by his place unannounced, require him at times to blow into an alcohol sensor, or give a urine sample,'' Scripture said. `` He must have a phone so that there can be telephone cheks to make sure he is there and he would have to request the opportunity to have visitors.'' Under the program, <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> could begin the 300 hours of community service also part of his sentence. The judge ordered <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> to pay a $ 1,500 fine as well.

<HEAD>Pay For Teachers Reaches New High</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Average beginning teacher salaries pushed past $ 18,000 for the first time this past school year and average pay for the entire profession reached a record high of $ 28,085, a union survey revealed Friday. Teachers earned 17 percent more on average than all American workers in 1987 and 10 percent more than all government workers, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The public is really supporting teachers. It's the seventh straight year salaries have exceeded inflation,'' said <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an assistant research director of the AFT, which released the survey on the eve of its biennial convention. The AFT survey of state departments of education found starting salaries for the school year that just ended were $ 18,557, up 5.4 percent from a year earlier and more than double the $ 9,085 beginners were paid in 1977. The average salary for all teachers was up 5.5 percent over 1987, and <PERSON> Jewell </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, the AFT's director of research, predicted a similar increase for the school year starting this fall. The AFT salary data shows <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> at the top of the pay scale with average salaries of $ 40,510 and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> at the bottom with $ 19,758. But the AFT also ranked the states by cost-of-living and by how teachers' pay compared to salaries of other workers. The adjustment for differences in the cost of living `` shows that <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> pay teachers the most. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> -LRB- are -RRB- on the bottom.'' Adjusted for inflation, the record $ 28,085 average salary is just $ 665 more than teachers earned in 1972. The average 1972 salary of $ 9,705 is the equivalent of $ 27,420 in today's prices. Likewise, the beginning salary of $ 6,970 in 1972 is the equivalent of $ 19,739 in today's dollars _ more than today's starting salaries <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> singled out <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the state of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> as places that are `` setting a new standard for teacher salaries.'' The 665,000-member AFT represents nearly a half-million of the nation's 2.4 million public school teachers, primarily in big cities. The 1.9 million-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which opens its convention Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, has 1.5 million members. `` Connecticut reported the highest salary increase _ 15.8 percent for 1987-88,'' pushing its average pay level to $ 33,776, fifth in the nation, the AFT report said. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fondy </PERSON>, president of both the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said that under a new four-year contract, average salaries in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> will rise from $ 38,000 to $ 46,000 by 1991, with top-scale veterans earning $ 51,000. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> has a contract that will push its top scale past $ 55,000, plus the possibility that lead teachers will earn nearly $ 70,000. Although teaching pays more on average than other government work and more than the average job in the private sector, the report said the average male, year-round worker earned 14 percent more in 1987 than the average teacher, who gets summers off. The average female, year-round worker made only 73 percent as much as teachers, most of whom are women. The AFT said <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> all have starting salaries in excess of $ 20,000, while only <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> start teachers off at less than $ 15,000. Although they earn more on average in real dollars than they did in 1972, today's teachers are also more experienced, with nearly 16 years in the classoom compared with less than 11 years then, the AFT said.

 A federal judge sentenced a former <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> sales manager to a six-month prison term Friday for stealing $ 2.5 million from the airline in what the defendant claimed was a plan with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to woo moderates in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The sentence was criticized immediately by a prosecutor as being too lenient. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON> received a three-year sentence with all but six months suspended for 21 counts of mail fraud, theft and interstate transportation of stolen securities. A further order crediting <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON> with the four months he spent in a British jail following his 1986 arrest means he will only serve two months. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> acknowledged that the sentence `` will strike some as extremely lenient.'' But the judge said the <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> government had not produced `` all knowledgeable witnesses'' who might have supported <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON>'s claim there has been `` some knowledge, some acquiesence, perhaps some complicity on the part of others.'' <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON>, 37, had contended that he was authorized by the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> royal family to spend the money, including $ 1 million to help finance an initiative with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to make contact with moderates in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. During the trial, <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON> testified that he met with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> in 1986 before embarking on a trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> where he planned to meet with the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on the first leg of the trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Outside the courtroom, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamanda </PERSON> said: `` We accept the judge's sentence as one that is within his power to impose.'' But <PERSON> Shamanda </PERSON> added that `` as the trial prosecutor, I do believe that to be too lenient. When you steal $ 2.5 million of your employer's money and get a six-month sentence, what signal does that send to the community?'' <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON> could have received five-year prison terms for each of six mail fraud counts and 10-year sentences for each of the 14 theft and interstate transportation of stolen securities counts. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> imposed the sentence after he rejected <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON>'s motion to set aside the verdict on the basis of newly discovered evidence to support his claim that the royal family authorized his expenditures. In May, <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON>'s lawyers produced an affidavit from the airlines' former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> manager who said he was aware of a special bank account used by <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON> to funnel the money from the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> accounts <PERSON> Inder </PERSON> <PERSON> Sethi </PERSON>, who could n't be located to testify at the trial, said in the affidavit that `` it was clear to me that many people, both in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, were aware of Mr. <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON>'s activities. `` To the best of my knowledge, no one questioned the propriety of Mr. <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON>'s actions during the entire time that I served as a regional manager,'' the affidavit said. But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>, who represented <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> in a related civil suit, said in another affidavit that when he interviewed <PERSON> Sethi </PERSON> last year, <PERSON> Sethi </PERSON> denied any knowledge of special accounts kept by <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Sethi </PERSON> said that he was shocked, or used some similar term, when he learned about what <PERSON> Sensi </PERSON> had done,'' <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said. Before taking the bench, <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Sethi </PERSON> in his chambers. Based on his conversation, the judge said he determined that <PERSON> Sethi </PERSON>'s statements did not provide sufficient evidence to warrant setting aside the verdict and ordering a new trial.

 A simmering feud in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership dominated the floor Friday and the first national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference since 1941 adjourned with a burst of candor not seen since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s infancy. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> encouraged both sides in the long-rumored dispute over dismissed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> to have their say. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> asked the conference to clear him of blame for an angry outburst against party conservatives last fall that cost him his job and a non-voting membership on the ruling Politburo. His most powerful opponent, Kremlin No. 2 man <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, took the floor to say <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> committed many errors and had not yet learned his lesson. More delegates also rose to criticize the wayward one-time protege of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. They accused <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> of being tactless on a trip abroad and giving interviews to foreign new agencies just to boost his own prestige. One claimed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> drove an underling to suicide. Others defended <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> in an open debate, the highlights of which were shown on television. The broadcast did not break away even for live coverage of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech closing the conference. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said <PERSON> Yelstin </PERSON> told his 5,000 fellow delegates that his only mistake in criticizing the bureaucracy last October was in speaking too soon. Extraordinary criticism of the Communist establishment was a hallmark of the four-day meeting, including at least one call for resignations of the old guard. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, is an outspoken reformer who became popular with Muscovites by demanding that stores provide more food and better consumer goods. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> brought him into the leadership, but joined in denouncing him after <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech to an October meeting of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s speech to the closed meeting has not been published, but reports said he offered to resign out of frustration over his inability to control the entrenched bureaucracy in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s party organization. His comments later were branded `` politically erroneous,'' and he was fired. He rekindled the controversy during last month's U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by calling for <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s resignation during an interview with Western television correspondents In an account carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told the conference Friday: `` I think my only mistake was that I spoke too early, before the 70th anniversary of the October Revolution. `` Taking to heart what happened, I ask the conference to change the decision of the plenum of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. If you find it possible to do this, you will rehabilitate me in the eyes of the Communists.'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, widely viewed as a conservative counterweight to the reform-minded <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, took the rostrum Friday evening as one of the final conference speakers. Defending his own credentials as a supporter of perestroika, as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ambitious modernization program is called, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> had executed some members of his family and expelled others from the party. He helped his region become self-sufficient in food while working as a party leader in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said, whereas `` the district where you, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON>, worked for nine years now has rationing of food.'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> also denounced <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> for criticizing the old guard. He credited veteran Politburo members <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> with helping <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gain power at a crucial meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> three years ago. Without their efforts, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said, `` others might be sitting here now'' on the dais. He said the leadership is united behind <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and declared: `` There are neither conservatives nor reformers among the leadership.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has `` not drawn the necessary conclusions from his mistakes and the principled criticism of his party comrades,'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in his closing speech Friday, dealt <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> the final blow. He defended the decision to give <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> the floor, saying `` We must remove all the shrouds of secrecy,'' then reviewed events that led to his dismissal, confirming many reports that have circulated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for months but never appeared in the official media. Taking responsiblity for the decision to promote <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> to the key <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party post, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the Politburo saw his excesses but did not act quickly enough. `` At a certain stage, we saw that something was wrong,'' he said, and it became apparent <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> `` was not up to the task'' of running <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s account, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> began losing his temper, barking orders and `` being rude,'' and attacked his own party organization. `` At first we thought he might be right,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` But when he began changing one after another of the party functionaries we became concerned and told him so. It was a time when practical problems had to be solved, but he did not act accordingly.'' He said the Politburo supported <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> until, during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s vacation last summer, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief wrote him asking to be relieved of his responsibilities. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he kept the letter confidential until they met when he returned from vacation. `` We decided to wait'' after the 70th anniversary celebrations the first week in November, he said, but then <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> spoke out at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. As <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recounted the story, he referred to a record of the secret proceeding. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> wanted to accept the resignation but he decided to wait until after the anniversary. When the celebrations were over, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> went to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party headquarters to participate in the meeting at which <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was ousted. He said at the time that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was overly ambitious.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intends to nominate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalon </PERSON>, a holdover member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, to serve additional time on the commission, the White House announced Friday. <PERSON> Stalon </PERSON>, 58, filled an unexpired term when he came to the commission in 1984. That term ran out last October. The law permits him to stay on for a year as long as no successor has been sworn in. On Thursday, the president said he intends to nominate <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Moler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff to <PERSON> Stalon </PERSON>'s seat.

<TEXT>
 The excommunication of Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON> marks one of the few times in recent years that the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has pronounced someone removed from the body of believers. In the church's history, excommunication often had political consequences and could even result in the death penalty. Today, however, the censure is intended to cut off an individual's participation in the church's spiritual life and persuade the offender to repent. The penalty has been applied to leaders, from <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> to former Argentine President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, as well as rebels against church teaching, such as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> from 1946-55 and 1973-74, was excommunicated in 1955 after launching an anti-clerical campaign. It was lifted after he repented, according to <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> sources. Excommunication was even applied to communist voters in 1949 under the militantly anti-communist Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON>, an action aimed at the Italian Communist Party. In recent years, however, the church has dropped all mention of communists or their supporters being excommunicated. `` It's certainly now a purely religious punishment,'' a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official said Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` During earlier times in Christian society, it had many social and political effects, but that does n't exist any more,'' the official added. An excommunicated Catholic can not participate in worship or receive the sacraments and is refused a Christian burial. In the early days of the church, Catholics were advised to shun people who had been excommunicated. By the 15th century, the church decided that such behavior was only necessary with the most serious offenders, those known as `` vitandi,'' a Latin term meaning to be avoided. Most of those excommunicated, including <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, are considered `` tolerati,'' to be tolerated. Among the actions that can cause excommunication are abortion, violation of the confidentiality of confession and consecration of a bishop without <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> approval. It was the latter act that resulted in <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>'s excommunication Thursday. During the Holy Roman Empire, from about 800 to 1806, excommunication was considered grounds for the death penalty, although it was not always carried out. Political considerations sometimes played a part in excommunications. Roman Emperor <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was excommunicated twice, in 1227 and 1239, because his growing empire threatened the independence of the Papal States. Another major excommunication battle occurred in the 16th century over <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>'s request for a divorce. The king tried from 1527-33 to persuade the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to grant him an annulment. The church did not budge, and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> subsequently declared the English church independent of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. He was promptly excommunicated by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> VII. Perhaps the most significant excommunication was that of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON>, the founder of the 16th century Reformation and of Protestantism. In 1517 Luther complained about the church practice of selling indulgences in exchange for a reduction in the penalty for sin. He widened his criticism, attacking papal authority and calling for a greater role for individual conscience. Pope <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON> excommunicated him in 1521. In recent years, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has excommunicated government officials who have attacked the church and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priests who have refused to give up government positions.

<HEAD>Fed Voted In May To Push Interest Rates Higher</HEAD>

 Top policy-makers at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> voted in mid-May to push interest rates higher as a way of fighting inflationary pressures, according to minutes of the discussions released Friday. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy for the central bank, voted 9-2 at a meeting on May 17 to tighten credit conditions slightly in the weeks following the meeting. The two dissenters, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoskins </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parry </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>, argued that a more substantial tightening move was needed to dampen inflationary pressures. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers met again on Wednesday and Thursday of this week and many analysts believe the central bank discussed boosting its discount rate, the interest it charges to make bank loans. An increase in the discount rate, which was last raised in September, is the strongest signal the central bank can send of its intention to push interest rates higher. The minutes of the May meeting confirmed what many analysts had already suspected, that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> moved in late May to tighten credit conditions because of concerns that the economy was growing so fast in the first part of the year that it was putting severe pressures on prices and wages. The last tightening move followed two earlier moves to push interest rates higher in late March and in early May. The central bank's goal was to restrain credit and thereby restrain overall demand in the economy. It accomplished this objective by restricting slightly the amount of money that banks have available to make loans, thus pushing up the price of that money _ interest rates. A variety of interest rates, including the bank prime lending rate, and mortgage rates, did move higher in the spring, partly as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s tightening moves. The minutes of the May meeting showed that <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials remained concerned about the rate of economic growth. `` The members generally agreed that some further tightening of reserve conditions was needed to counter the risks of rising inflationary pressures in the economy,'' the minutes said. `` A failure to act in a timely fashion not only would be inconsistent with the committee's commitment to achieving price stability over time but would in fact compound the difficulties of accomplishing that objective.'' The two dissenters argued that the central bank should be doing more than the small tightening steps it was contemplating. <PERSON> Hoskins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Parry </PERSON> argued that `` the risks were considerable that price and wage inflation would accelerate from rates that were already too high.'' They said unless the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> did more it ran the risk that it would have to drive interest rates up even more sharply later in the year to get inflation under control. The minutes said that <PERSON> Parry </PERSON> argued that the two tightening moves that had occurred in the weeks prior to the meeting were of `` insufficient magnitude to have much effect on the economy.'' Many economists are looking for a boost in the discount rate before the end of the month to 6.5 percent from the current 6 percent. They believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to act to keep this rate in line with other rates, which have been pushed higher. They argue that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will hike the discount rate now rather than run the risk that an increase later would become an issue in the presidential campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> FOMC </ORGANIZATION>, made up of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> governors and presidents of six of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s regional banks, also reviewed monetary policy through the first half of the year to decide whether any changes were needed in the monetary growth targets. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> will reveal the results of those deliberations when he testifies before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on July 13.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> celebrated its 30th anniversary Friday, touting its many research developments and contributions to passengers safety. `` We have some of the finest scientists in the world who live here. This is probably one of the finest research environments in the world,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, the center's director, who officiated at a small cake-cutting ceremony. The center is believed to be the largest research facility of its kind in the world. More than 2,000 people work at the 5,059-acre complex and it has an annual payroll of $ 85 million for employees and contractors. The center just outside <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> has helped develop fire-retardant seat cushions, emergency evacuation chutes that wo n't melt in a fire, floor lights to guide passengers through smoky aisles, computer programs for air traffic controllers and a new warning device to help pilots avoid mid-air collisions well before other planes are in sight. Researchers also are working on projects that include finding ways of detecting bulk explosives and plastic weapons to avoid terrorist hijackings, and using satellites to assist air controllers with overseas flights, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. The technical center is largely responsible for keeping the aviation industry in line with projected air traffic growth, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, proposed a broadened role for the center. `` There has to be a more direct link between our research facilities and universities and colleges. We're losing opportunities, and this is an ideal site to develop a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which would provide undergraduate and graduate training ...,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. Such an institute, although still in the planning stage, would incorporate the expertise of specialists in the aviation industry, government and universities, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Technical center employees do much of their work in laboratories, such as a giant hangar where fires are set in a hollowed-out aircraft fuselage or the airport security lab that is surrounded by barbed wire. But research also takes place in the air with test aircraft.

 An amusement park worker was in custody Friday after the stabbing deaths of four relatives and the wounding of a fifth, a crime neither police nor the uncle who summoned authorities can explain. <PERSON> Joselito </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON>, 23, who arrived in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> about five months ago, was arrested late Thursday at a gas station about a block from the duplex where the bodies of his brother, two sisters and a niece were found. The slayings apparently occurred late Thursday, but authorities had not established a motive, Sgt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. A 13-inch kitchen knife, believed to be the murder weapon, was found in a yard three houses from the scene, he said. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, Camangian's uncle, said that after the rampage, his nephew said calmly, `` Maybe I'm going crazy. ... I do n't know what I did,'' and told him to call police. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> and relatives said <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON> had undergone drug rehabilitation in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> about five years ago, but could n't say what drug was involved or whether there had been a relapse since he came to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. He was listening to rock music on the radio when he suddenly began attacking family members, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. Camagian, who had started work this week at a pizzeria at <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> amusement park, was booked for investigation of four counts of homicide and one count of attempted homicide, police said. Officers arrived in response to a call from <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, who lives in the other half of the duplex where the stabbings occurred. <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> ran for help after his niece, <PERSON> Candida </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON>, 26, and her brother, <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON>, 29, came to his home for help. Both were wounded; the man later died. `` I heard a woman screaming, asking for help at my door,'' <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, 48, said on Friday. `` It was my niece. She told me to call an ambulance because her brother, ` <PERSON> Lito </PERSON>,' was stabbing people.'' Moments later, <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON> arrived, clutching an abdominal wound. `` I brought him inside, locked the door, and went for help,'' said <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, who does not have a telephone, said he went to a shopping center, where a gasoline station owner helped him call police. As the two were talking, the suspect appeared. `` I was scared because I thought he was holding something,'' said <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>. `` But he was n't. He approached me calmly and said, ` Maybe I'm going crazy. I stabbed somebody and I do n't know what I did. Call the police.''' In all, 11 relatives lived in the duplex, but they were not all at home at the time of the attack, police said. Another sister, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON>, said, `` My sister said that for some reason <PERSON> Joselito </PERSON> had a knife in his hand. <PERSON> Erlinda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Candida </PERSON> tried to grab the knife. ... They thought he had an enemy outside. And then just after that, he started stabbing.'' Some victims had defensive wounds on their hands, and there were signs of a `` substantial struggle'' in the house, <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said. Outside, blood was smeared around the doors of the duplex and the pavement around it. <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> said he had seen Camangian that day and saw nothing strange in his behavior. <PERSON> Candida </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON> was listed in serious condition at <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with a chest wound, according to nursing supervisor <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickwire </PERSON>. In addition to <PERSON> Ric </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON>, 29; police identified the victims as his sisters <PERSON> Emerenciana </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Erlinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Camangian </PERSON>, 30; and a niece of the siblings, <PERSON> Laraina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodrigues </PERSON>, 15, who was visiting from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rural Satellite TV Distributor Offering Cable Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A package of cable TV services that includes popular premium channels should be available to many rural home satellite dish owners this summer, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The services will be made available under an agreement the cooperative reached with six major programming services on Thursday, just hours after a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel approved a bill requiring cable networks to sell their programming to independent distributors. The agreement is the first involving an independent distributor and premium cable services. The cooperative said it will add the channels to the program package it now markets through rural utility systems in 45 states. Included in the agreement are <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nickelodeon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Netlink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been concerned that some cable programmers have been unwilling to sell their programming to third-party distributors, thus shutting out potential competitors and depriving the nation's nearly 2 million dish owners of easy access to scrambled cable programming. Most of the popular cable programmers scramble their signals. Dish owners with a decoder can subscribe directly with these cable programmers, but they have to subscribe separately with each. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee on Thursday voted 13-11 to require programmers who sell to one distributor other than a cable company to sell to all other distributors. But subcommittee members also urged the industry to work out its own solution, and indicated the bill might be dropped if the industry showed competitive forces were at work in the marketplace.

 Parliament accused <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Friday of violating human rights and urged its Eastern European neighbor to reconsider a plan to resettle ethnic Hungarians. Newspapers reported that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> began turning back Hungarian tourists. It expelled a group of Hungarian diplomats Tuesday. A <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resolution adopted Friday said the fellow Soviet-bloc nation had violated `` the funamental human, national and nationalities-related rights.'' It did not mention <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s decision to close a Hungarian consulate and expel its staff, or the Romanian order closing a Hungarian cultural center in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. The resolution said a planned resettlement project that may affect 7,000 Romanian villages, including many where ethnic Hungarians live, would be `` contrary to the spirit of humanism as well as to the concept of socialism.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> says the plan to move residents of 7,000 villages to new agricultural-industrial centers would destroy the culture and traditions of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s ethnic Hungarian minority. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> says it will help villagers by providing services now found only in cities. Relations reached an unprecedented low this week and Hungarian leaders appealed to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> not to make the situation worse. `` We will always be cooperating partners,'' Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> said when he presented the resolution on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. `` Unfortunately, -LRB- relations -RRB- are still further deteriorating.'' He said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was prepared to proceed with preparations for a proposed meeting of premiers. Some newspapers said Hungarians trying to enter <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> were being turned back, and at some border points only people in transit through <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> were allowed to cross. the evening daily <ORGANIZATION> Esti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>, however, quoted a Hungarian border official as saying `` there is no ban'' on Hungarian travel. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s decision to close a consulate in <LOCATION> Cluj </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Traynsylvania </LOCATION>, where most of the 1.7 ethnic Hungarians live, came after 50,000 people marched past the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Monday to protest the resettlement plan. In its resolution, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> said carrying out the program `` would ... impose new burdens on Hungarian-Romanian relations,'' the resolution said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, noting the 20th anniversary of the signing of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, called on all nations Friday to join in the quest to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons. `` I firmly believe that nuclear war can never be won and must never be fought,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement. `` If we are to succeed in halting the spread of nuclear weapons, the nations of the world must continue to work together.'' Sixty-one nations signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 20 years ago. Today, 136 countries are parties to the accord. Two nuclear powers, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, are not parties to the treaty. Among the other countries that do not participate in it are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the treaty `` one of the international community's most vital instruments for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and strengthening international peace and stability. He said, `` I call on all countries that have not yet adhered to the Non-Proliferation Treaty to do so to demonstrate their commitment to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and to strengthening the foundations of peace. I also urge all parties to the treaty to rededicate themselves to achieving its objectives.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted in a separate statement that `` the nuclear-weapon states which are parties to the treaty have agreed not to assist non-nuclear-weapon states to acquire nuclear explosives. The non-nuclear-weapon states in turn pledge not to acquire nuclear explosives.'' `` These mutual pledges acknowledge that the technology of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosives can not be distinguished and that their further spread threatens the security of all nations,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s statement said.

<TEXT>
 An estimated 6,000 pounds of pure cocaine, sealed in blocks of chocolate, was seized at a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> warehouse in what may be the nation's largest drug bust outside <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, officials announced Friday. The seizure, valued at $ 480 million, is likely to drive up the price of coke in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area this summer, some officials said. Three Colombian nationals, thought to be members of a major Colombian drug cartel, were arrested in a raid of the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> Imports warehouse in <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION> by 50 agents Thursday night, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs inspectors stumbled on the cocaine shipment June 24 during a routine check aboard the <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Lykes </PERSON> at a port in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baish </PERSON>, agent in charge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The shipment was from <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and the inspection was `` a cold hit,'' he said, explaining that inspectors had no tip or advance warning of the contraband. `` This was a picture perfect case,'' <PERSON> Baish </PERSON> said. `` The hit is phenomenal for us.'' He said the agents were attracted to the shipment, 1,200 cartons marked `` industrialized cocoa powder,'' because <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is a source country for cocaine. They sunk a drill into one of the cardboard boxes and hit a metal box hidden in the inner core of the hardened chocolate, said <PERSON> Baish </PERSON>. Agents opened the carton and found the cocaine inside the metal box, he said. They re-sealed it and kept a surveillance on the shipment with the help of electronic monitoring devices, he said. When the shipment was picked up Thursday, narcotics agents followed the trucks, said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The trucks were intercepted before reaching the warehouse and undercover agents took the place of the drivers, according to <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON>. He said the drivers were not part of the scheme and were unaware of the contents of their cargo. The agents and the three defendants unloaded the boxes into the warehouse. A few hours later when the suspects began moving some cartons out to their cars, agents made the arrests. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Absalon </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrero </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Anz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, were charged with importation and distribution of cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. They were ordered held without bail at their arraignment before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrein </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said the suspects are believed to be members of the <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> family, of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, one of three leaders in cocaine production and importation. Each box weighed about 66 pounds. Each package of cocaine within weighed six to eight pounds and was marked with the initials of the person who had ordered it, said <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said 779 of the 1,200 cartons contained cocaine. `` This is the largest seizure in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outside of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>. `` And there are only two seizures in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that are greater.'' <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> declined to comment on whether <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> Imports was connected to the scheme. He said more arrests are expected in the case. Authorities believe that agents have been successful in plugging up ports in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> which is putting pressure on smugglers to seek other areas, such as the Northeast, as ports of entry. <PERSON> Stiffel </PERSON> estimated that the cost of cocaine around <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will increase by $ 4,000 a kilogram because of the seizure.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Bill To Strengthen Residential Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Friday proposed tough measures to enforce residential segregation, and critics said it could mean mass eviction of blacks from white areas. `` The new amendment has a clear political message _ apartheid is alive and well,'' said <PERSON> Mahomed </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangor </PERSON>, spokesman for a group which has fought to block evictions of blacks living illegally in whites-only areas. Government opponents condemned the proposal to tighten enforcement of the Group Areas Act, which segregates residential areas by race. The government has not strictly enforced the 35-year-old act in recent years, angering conservative whites opposed to integrated neighborhoods. The proposed amendment is viewed as an accommodation to right-wing whites prior to nationwide municipal elections in October. `` The government indicates once again its absolute obsession with skin color as a norm on which to base <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s political, social and economic life,'' said the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member for the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called the new measures `` so harsh and so brutal'' that up to 200,000 blacks could be evicted on short notice. The Group Areas Amendment bill calls for hiring inspectors to check for violations of the law. It would make it easier for authorities to confiscate property and to evict and prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race group. The maximum fine for a property owner who allows a person to live outside his race group area would be increased from the current $ 175 to $ 4,300. The The maximum prison sentence would be increased from two years to five years. The bill also would negate a court ruling that violators can not be evicted until alternative housing is found. A second bill proposed Friday, the Free Settlement Areas Bill, would allow the creation of the first legal multiracial residential areas, subject to approval by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and other officials. No neighborhood could be intergrated against the wishes of its residents. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favors gradual race reform but is committed to preserving white `` group rights'' such as segregated neighorhoods and schools. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has held power for 40 years but has been losing ground to the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes all concessions to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26-million black majority. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which controls the mixed-race chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said the Group Areas Act `` can not be amended and must be repealed.'' `` We once again call on the Nationalist government to repeal this immoral, ungodly, and iniquitous act that has been, and still is, the cause of so much hurt, pain and suffering,'' the party said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has a housing surplus in white areas and a severe shortage in black townships. Many whites have been moving from inner cities to suburban areas, leaving urban landlords little choice but to rent to non-whites in `` white'' neighborhoods such as <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The bill is to be debated at the end of August, in the next session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Also Friday, anti-apartheid church leaders called for an end to executions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and said they would not comply with a directive to submit a church publication to censors. The decisions were among more than 30 resolutions adopted at the close of a five-day conference convened by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, to which most major Protestant denominations belong. On Thursday, leaders of 16 churches affiliated to the council deliberately defied a state-of-emergency regulation by announcing their opposition to participation in nationwide municipal elections Oct. 26. Calls for an election boycott are outlawed under a regulation implemented June 10. The clergymen, like many other anti-apartheid activists, oppose black participation in local elections until the black majority obtains full political rights on the national level.

<TEXT>
 Iran-Contra prosecutors on Friday urged a judge to reject fired White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s renewed attempts to obtain secret documents concerning other covert operations he participated in or that came to his attention. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> claimed in court papers that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s latest request shows he wants `` to embark on a fishing expedition into the nation's most sensitive classified materials.'' He accused North of trying to `` convert the discovery rules into a vehicle for rummaging through files that are irrelevant to the charges in the indictment, thereby delaying the trial of this matter.'' North is awaiting trial on charges he conspired with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former national security adviser, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, and two arms dealers to divert U.S.-Iran arms sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. His lawyers recently asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to reconsider his refusal to force the government to produce classified documents about other covert operations that he knew about or participated in while a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide. North is requesting documents about covert operations that used `` commercial cutouts, foreign bank accounts, or other methods or techniques similar to those allegedly used in connection with the Iranian initiative or in connection with the support for the Nicaraguan resistance.'' Material sought includes documents about covert operations undertaken `` without an express, written presidential finding'' authorizing the activity. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contended that none of the materials is relevant to any defense <PERSON> North </PERSON> might offer that he acted with authority of higher government officials. No date has been set for North's trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has also ordered separate trials for <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj.

<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official acknowleged Friday that his country used deadly chemical weapons in its 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but claimed the Iranians had used them first The comments by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> appeared to be the first direct admission that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used chemical weapons, which are outlawed by international agreement. But <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> defended his country's use of chemical weapons, saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was a `` great threat'' to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` When we want peace, we have to respect all conventions. But you can not say I'm going to respect all these conventions and give the other side the liberty not to respect them,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> declined to comment on the acknowlegment by <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, except to repeat that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had condemned the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team arrived Friday in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to investigate accusations that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons in a recent attack on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> report said Iraqi chemical weapons killed 60 people and injured 4,000 in a June attack on the western Iranian city of <LOCATION> Ahwaz </LOCATION>. Only 100 of the injured were hospitalized and 10 of those were in critical condition, said the report, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. On April 25, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said there was evidence that both countries were using chemical weapons in their war. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief had sent a physician from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and examine victims of alleged chemical attacks. On May 9, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemned the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report says both sides have used them -LRB- chemical weapons -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> started its use. We were victims many times, since the early beginning of the conflict.'' Asked if it was true both sides had used such weapons during the conflict, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> replied: `` Both sides.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also claims <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> killed 5,000 people, mostly Iraqi Kurds, in a mustard gas and cyanide attack on the Iranian-held <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> last March. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not deny the charge then and said it would use all necessary means to repel Iranian forces. It also accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denies that its forces have used such weapons. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> also accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of violating international accords on the treatment of prisoners. `` Lately 7,000 Iraqi prisoners of war disappeared. We do n't yet know what their destiny is,'' said <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> repeated assertions that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> started the war by invading <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and that his country had the right to choose the means for its defense. But the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government blames <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for starting the war, pointing out that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> bombed Iranian airfields in September 1980 and saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military responded to that attack. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> also said that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s recent war successes do not mean that his country has changed its position of wanting to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. `` We hope they -LRB- <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB- will draw the correct conclusions from the present situation _ that the path to war leads ... only to continued killing and destruction,'' he said. `` But the question still remains whether they will reach that reasonable conclusion.''

<HEAD>Soviet Delegate Urges Approval of Compromise Draft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Friday praised a compromise proposal at the stalled 35-nation conference on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> security. Speaking at a plenary meeting, Soviet chief delegate <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kashlev </PERSON> indirectly criticized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, an East-bloc ally. He said the question facing the conference is whether it can overcome a `` game of extremist counter-amendments'' that could sink the compromise package worked out by nine neutral and nonaligned countries last month. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> began in November 1986. It is being attended by all signatories to the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> conference including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and all European states except <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. Romanian delegate <PERSON> Dumitru </PERSON> <PERSON> Aninoiu </PERSON> reportedly rejected at an earlier meeting most of the human rights provisions in the compromise plan, saying the nations that drafted the proposal had bowed to Western demands. <PERSON> Kashlev </PERSON>, referring to the Romanian position, said Friday the question `` now is whether we will be able to adopt a final document representing a new word in the -LRB- conference -RRB-, particularly in the military and humanitarian fields, or whether we will fail to do so because some states are playing a game of extremist counter-amendments in an attempt to ignore the legitimate, reasonable and minimalistic positions of other delegations.'' His unusual criticism of a Soviet-bloc member came as West German and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> foreign ministers Friday joined other delegates in praising the compromise plan designed to end the deadlocked conference. `` The overall draft ... is a forward looking document that offers a basis for consensus and thus to our concluding efforts,'' West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told the conference. `` We must not lose any more time.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said the proposal, which also calls for the convening of a human rights conference, `` is not only the base the 35 nations can work on, but also the balancing point'' that could lead to a final agreement. Neither <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> indicated when they thought the conference might end. Among the remaining obstacles are <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s opposition to the compromise and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet-bloc differences on whether to keep tactical nuclear weapons off the agenda, as the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> insists. A final document must receive the approval of all 35 nations. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>, referring to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, said the principle of consensus `` does not imply that a state can cling to proposals for which, during the long negotiations, it has been unable to gain the support of any other participating state.'' <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> told reporters he planned to confer with Romanian delegates in search of a solution. `` I ca n't say that the Romanian attitude will block the conference,'' he said.

 A jury Friday convicted <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> of murdering two of six women he abducted and kept shackled in his basement torture chamber. The case focused on whether <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> knew right from wrong when he raped and killed women he lured to his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> home. The defense argued he is schizophrenic and not responsible for his actions. <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>, 44, was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping, rape, aggravated assault and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. He was acquitted of one count of the latter charge. Judge <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> set Saturday morning for the start of a penalty hearing. Prosecutors have said they would seek the death penalty. Jurors, chosen in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> because of pretrial publicity here, began deliberating Wednesday afternoon, and issued their verdict at 3:30 p.m. Friday. `` Thank God it was guilty of first-degree,'' said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, sister of <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, one of the women who died in <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s house and who according to testimony had been sawed apart, some of her remains fed to other captives. `` Thank God that the jury listened to the case,'' she said. `` He deserved, ` Guilty, guilty, guilty.' Now I'm hoping for the death penalty. That was a brutal way for my sister to die, tortured. Nobody deserves to die like that.'' Another victim's sister, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, whose sister <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> was electrocuted when <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> touched live wires to her chains while she stood in a water-filled pit, said, `` I feel good. He got what he deserved.'' `` Now I hope he gets the chair and <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> can rest in peace,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said. Defense attorney <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> called the verdict `` a big letdown.'' He said <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> spoke to him after the verdict but declined to reveal the conversation. `` Whatever he said, he had no emotion,'' <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> said. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said, `` The jury did an excellent job. `` It is a difficult task for a jury to perform, that is, to sit in judgment upon one's peer. This case presented very difficult and complicated legal issues, all of which the jury pondered for quite a bit of time and came to a just decision.'' During the polling of the jury, the 44-year-old <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> stared straight ahead, showing no emotion. The sole innocent verdict came in a charge involving <PERSON> Josefina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a prostitute <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> seized in November 1986. It was Ms. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> who eventually escaped and brought police to <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON>'s so-called `` House of Horrors,'' where he had imprisoned the women. <PERSON> Peruto </PERSON> had argued <PERSON> Heidnik </PERSON> was insane, a `` fruitcake'' who suffered from schizophrenia first diagnosed in 1963, for which he was discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` This man conducted repeated sadistic acts on six defenseless persons,'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> argued. `` What he did was premeditated, deliberate murder. He knew what he was doing and he knew it was wrong.''

 Space workers will hold a special Fourth of July ceremony when they move Discovery to the launch pad to be readied for the first space shuttle mission since the Challenger tragedy. One of the five astronauts slated to fly the early September mission and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials will watch from a flag-bedecked grandstand as the spaceship is rolled out of an assembly building into the glare of spotlights at 12:01 a.m. Monday. Discovery will be perched upright on a giant tracked transporter for the six-to-seven-hour trip over a 4.2-mile course to Launch Pad 39B. The move is timed to avoid thunderstorms and lightning, which often occur during the daytime this time of year. In a brief ceremony as the move begins, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, director of the Kennedy Space Center, will present the astronaut with a book containing signatures of the 15,240 workers here who have labored to return the shuttle fleet to space. Commander <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and his crew, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, will take the book into space with them on a four-day mission. <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON> planned to be here for the rollout ceremony. After Discovery is on the pad, employees and their families will be able to drive by between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. Monday to get a close look before a service structure encloses the spaceship. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, shuttle operations director here, said delays in preparing Discovery placed the rollout date on the Fourth of July. `` We did n't plan it that way,'' he said. `` We had hoped to do it earlier.'' Asked if a rollout on the nation's birthday might have an emotional impact, <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON> replied, `` No doubt it will have an effect. The biggest effect and the biggest morale booster we can give ourselves is to move the shuttle out to the pad, because that's where it belongs. The name of the game here is to get the vehicle ready to fly, and that's what we're going to do.'' He said checks of systems will begin as soon as Discovery is on the pad, and workers will begin preparing the spaceship for critical firing of its three main engines on July 24. With the craft bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the engines will be ignited for 19.4 seconds to test modifications and to give the launch team countdown practice. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since Challenger and its crew of seven were lost in an explosion 73 seconds after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986. Earlier this week, the space agency announced it had officially delayed Discovery's launch from late August until early September because it was taking longer than expected to prepare the vehicle.

 The prosecution sought a life sentence Friday for a man charged with kidnapping Dutch supermarket tycoon <PERSON> Gerrit-Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>, killing him and collecting $ 4 million in ransom. Prosecutor <PERSON> Onno </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> made the demand after a day of testimony in the trial of <PERSON> Ferdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON>, a 45-year-old unemployed business consultant. <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> is charged with abducting and killing <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION> concern, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> biggest supermarket chain. <ORGANIZATION> Ahold </ORGANIZATION> also owns the <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bi-Lo </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> `` killed a man in cold blood ... according to a well-devised plan.'' <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> has said he picked his victim at random and planned the kidnapping for months. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s family paid $ 4 million in cash and diamonds for his release, but <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> told the court Friday he had shot and killed the 56-year-old kidnap victim with a 9mm pistol near <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s makeshift grave the day he was abducted. `` It was money and diamonds that motivated <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON>, and everything else was subordinated to that,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Veen </PERSON> said. The court said it would rule July 13. Under the Dutch penal system, a life sentence means 20 years' imprisonment A prisoner may be released for good behavior after serving two-thirds of his term. <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> disappeared Sept. 9 after leaving his home to go to a dental appointment. His body was exhumed April 4 in a forest near <LOCATION> Renkum </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> gave the court on Friday a description of <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s final hours: `` The two of us sat in the sun for a while and drank some orange juice. He -LRB- <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> -RRB- had never suspected what was going to happen to him,'' <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>, the victim's widow, and three of their children attended the trial. In October, when <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON>'s kin demanded some sign he was alive, they received his little finger. <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> told police he cut the finger off after he killed the grocery baron. At the end of the eight-hour trial, <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON>, reading from a prepared statement, said: `` Words can not compensate the loathsome crimes I have committed and the immeasurable grief I have caused to the <PERSON> Heijn </PERSON> family. `` I want to say that I am sorry. I now live in a nightmare from which I shall never awake.'' A forensic psychiatrist told the court <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> was not fully responsible for his deeds at the time of the abduction. If the court accepts that finding, it could impose a limited jail sentence followed by open-ended confinement to an institution for the criminally insane. Police arrested <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON> in a raid on his home in a small <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> suburb after a huge search. <PERSON> Elsas </PERSON>' arrest followed discovery of a 250-guilder note from the ransom payment in January by a bank employee in the Dutch capital. The note was traced back to a supermarket where the suspect did his shopping. Police recovered nearly all the ransom.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> won <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> backing Friday for sweeping changes that would limit top officials to 10 years in office and create a stronger presidency that he might assume while remaining party chief. The four-day national conference of 5,000 party members, the first since 1941, closed with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> saying the reforms would point the way to a new `` democratic image of socialism.'' He also found himself in the middle of an open feud between the No. 2 <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, and former <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, which was played out on television and gave millions of viewers an unprecedented look at cracks in the party monolith. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, secretary of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told a late-night news briefing that several resolutions were approved. He said the conference backed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals to allow elected party officials only two five-year terms, with no exceptions. He also said the new, stronger presidency would have the powers <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> requested to settle matters of foreign policy and head the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a position traditionally held by the party chief. Also approved was <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s controversial recommendation that party leaders lead the corresponding legislatures, all the way up to combining the job of president and party general secretary. That could enable <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to take an even firmer grip on power by assuming a stronger presidency while retaining the party leadership. <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>, a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo, said 209 delegates voted against that provision, an extremely rare show of dissent in the party. An amendment calling for the party newspaper Pravda to be taken away from the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and turned over to the party as a whole received only 56 votes, said <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency. Assessing the results of the conference just before it closed late Friday night, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said: `` Through democratization, economic reform and changes in the political system we will make perestroika irreversible. We will reach a fundamentally new state of our society, a new humane and democratic image of socialism.'' Perestroika, or restructuring, is the name <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has given the ambitious reform program on which he embarked soon after gaining the leadership in March 1985. In his final address, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also proposed a final break with the Stalinist past by building a monument in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to the dictator's millions of victims and said elections for stronger local and national legislatures should be held next spring. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> presided over an `` unusually stormy and long'' debate on resolutions. That reflected the extraordinary spirit of open criticism permitted during the meeting. The main drama on the final day was provided by the bitter personal dispute between <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> devoted much of his final 40-minute speech to a critique of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s work as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief before his dismissal last November. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> appealed to the conference to absolve him of any blame for accusing entrenched bureaucracy of slowing down the pace of reform. That criticism cost him his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> job and his non-voting seat on the Politburo. He has identified <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> in foreign television interviews as the official most responsible for holding up reforms, and called on him to resign. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> thundered back in a speech Friday that he made his region self-sufficient in food while working as a party leader in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, but `` the district where you, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON>, worked for nine years now has rationing of food.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> broke in at one point to quiet delegates and make sure <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> could finish his address. As he closed the session he gave a lengthy account of <PERSON> Yelstin </PERSON>'s failings. Resolutions adopted by the conference were not published immediately but <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> protege, told the news conference the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader has won his fight to reform the political system. About the dissenting votes, <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> said: `` Nothing of the kind has happened for a long time at a similar forum.'' In his closing remarks, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and other party organs should settle questions of political reform on an urgent basis so a fall session of the Supreme Soviet can begin to implement it. He said elections for the new legislatures could be held next April. Referring to his proposals for a new 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, a smaller and more active Supreme Soviet, and for presidential powers over defense and foreign policy, he said: `` the conference will continue living in the society, in the discussions in the society, but now we know how we must transform the political system.'' <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> has become the object of increasingly sharp criticism since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glasnost policy of greater openness made such comment possible, but the decision to build a monument to his victims is the most definitive step Soviet authorities have taken to repudiate him. `` I think we must agree to this, and such a monument must be constructed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` This would be an honest step, and it will be supported by the entire <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people.''

<HEAD>Ethiopia Says it Captured Two More Towns from Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> said Friday its forces have recaptured two more towns from rebels in northern <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> province, leaving only one key center in guerrilla hands. State radio said the 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> drove guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Adwa </LOCATION>, about 70 miles northwest of the Tigrean capital of <LOCATION> Mekelle </LOCATION>, in an ongoing counteroffensive this week. Rebels seized all the main towns in the province except <LOCATION> Mekelle </LOCATION> in February and March. In the previous 10 days, the Marxist government led by <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mariam </ORGANIZATION> has reported recapturing all key centers except Inda-Selassie, about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Axum </LOCATION>. State radio reports suggested the guerrillas were driven into the barren mountains of western Tigre. There was no way to verify independently government or rebel communiques about insurgencies which have raged for 14 years in <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> and 27 years in neighboring <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> province. Eritrean guerrillas are fighting for control of the province. Tigreans demand more autonomy for their area.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Friday urged all Cambodian factions to form a coalition government as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws its forces, shifting policy in an apparent effort to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Cambodian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from becoming dominant. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said that once an interim government is established, `` a freeze should be imposed on Kampuchean -LRB- Cambodian -RRB- forces of all factions and these factions should refrain from'' interfering in free general elections. The Chinese government, the main ally of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s anti-Vietnamese resistance, previously insisted no national reconciliation could take place in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdrew all its troops. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978, ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government and installed another communist regime. Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and some countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have expressed concern that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal will create an opening for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to again seize power. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> came to power after defeating the U.S.-backed government in the spring of 1975. According to some estimates, up to 3 million Cambodians were killed under the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has backed a three-party anti-Vietnamese coalition headed by former Cambodian Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The coalition includes <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s followers, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and a non-communist group under <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is believed to have a stronger fighting force than its coalition partners. In a proposal issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> should withdraw all of its estimated 140,000 troops `` at the earliest possible date,'' and the three resistance groups and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> should form a provisional government headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> while <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> pulls out. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said this week it had begun withdrawing 50,000 troops and its military command from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in an operation to be completed in December. It said it will have removed all of its forces by 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> proposal called for `` practical and effective international supervision'' of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troop withdrawal, the maintenance of peace in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and free elections. It did not elaborate on which countries it envisioned joining in the supervision or if they should send troops to form a peacekeeping force. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s proposal appeared timed for consideration by the four Cambodian parties at informal talks to be held in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> later this month. Its conciliatory tone was in sharp contrast to other recent Chinese statements that have called <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troop withdrawal plan inadequate and a possible hoax. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said last week that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had signaled in private its willingness to support a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government without the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> denied that. The new statement, however, appeared an effort to acknowledge concern over the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and guard against the group taking sole power.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> ended a visit to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Friday and leaders of Nicaraguan guerrillas said they discussed with him ways to win congressional approval for aid to the rebels. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a leader of the rebels known as Contras, met with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Thursday and later said the package discussed could include direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the leftist Sandinista government if it fulfills promised democratic reforms. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut all aid to the Nicaraguan government in 1981. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spent six hours in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> after a flight from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, where another rebel leader, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, said there was discussion on a $ 30 million aid package for the insurgents. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said there have been informal talks about the possibility of setting aside $ 7 million and releasing it as military aid the Sandinistas do not meet promises for greater democracy. All sides agreed that no decisions have been made on a Contra aid package. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said only that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be asked to approve an unspecified amount of additional assistance. The rebels have received no military aid since Feb. 29. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 17 million humanitarian aid package in late March after the rebels and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agreed on a temporary truce. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> responded positively to the idea of a new aid package in which a portion would be earmarked for military assistance and placed in an escrow account. `` There is no doubt in my mind that he's very enthusiastic about it, very enthusiastic,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials accompanying <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> seemed annoyed that the Contra aid issue was deflecting attention from <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s principal message during his three-day tour of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>: that the region's democratic countries are progressing while <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is lagging far behind. At an airport arrival ceremony in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> attended by hundreds of flag-waving school children, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said there has been a two-thirds decline in living standards in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> over the past four months. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not mention a new aid package for the Contras. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and then told reporters at a news conference only that the administration is `` seeking obviously to support those who stand up and are ready to struggle'' against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had proposed a meeting with the foreign ministers of the four countries he visited to be held before a scheduled Central American summit that would include <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in early August. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for his regional peace plan, said the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> suggestion specifically excluded <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from the proposed foreign ministers meeting. He also said he told <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that talks between the Sandinistas and Contras have not failed yet and suggested neither side has put its final bargaining position on the table. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said he hoped the two sides would agree to meet this month. The idea of approving military aid and placing it in an escrow account has been discussed in recent weeks by pro-Contra lawmakers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said he expects legislation to be introduced soon in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, with the campaign spearheaded by Democratic Sens. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Joining them is Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, the aid package would be for the six-month period between October 1988 and March 1989. The most innovative aspect of the aid proposal is the pledge to provide economic aid to the Sandinistas if they meet Contra demands for democratization. <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, meeting with reporters Thursday, called the package a `` carrot and stick'' approach, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> non-compliance with promised reformed would trigger military aid for the Contras. The <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration sought to woo the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> with economic aid after the triumph of the revolution in July 1979. About $ 120 million was spent, but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration suspended the program in April 1981, citing alleged Sandinista efforts to export their revolution. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are continuing to subvert their neighbors. `` I want to make it absolutely clear that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not tolerate the subversion or destabilization of the democratic governments of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Salvage workers on Friday sawed in two the wreck of a sunken tanker loaded with a deadly chemical as a preliminary to raising the hulk, Dutch television reported. None of the Dutch-flagged <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broere </PERSON>'s cargo of 1,600 tons of highly toxic acrylonitrile leaked from its tanks during the hourlong operation, the TV report said. Salvage crews fled on Thursday when an acrylonitrile tank sprang a leak during efforts to lift the ship, but no injuries were reported. The chemical, a highly carcinogenic and inflammable agent, is used by the plastics industry. Workers on Friday used a 16-ton chain to separate the ship's aft section, which contains the engine room, from the fore part, where the tanks are, the report said. It said this was done to facilitate hoisting the wreck to the surface later. The sawing operation marked the latest episode in efforts to salvage the ship and its hazardous cargo after the <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broere </PERSON> collided with a freighter 40 miles off the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> on May 27. The 180-foot fore section and the 60-foot aft section are expected to be raised over the weekend, the report said. A first attempt to salvage the <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broere </PERSON> failed last month when two of the four steel cables holding the vessel broke. A coast guard official said water samples taken Thursday showed a sudden increase in the levels of acrylonitrile in the water at the site, and divers quickly boarded small boats kept nearby for emergencies. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that at about 9.30 p.m. Thursday, the levels rose to more than seven times the amount considered safe by the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.

 About 220 West German environmentalists scampered over a 13-foot-high section of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall into Communist territory Friday to dodge police trying to clear them away from a disputed spot near the wall. Most of them returned to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> later in the day. Police said nine protesters were arrested, but eight were released later. Authorities issued a removal order Friday after a 5-week struggle that pitted environmentalists against city developers. The demonstrators were protesting plans to build a highway through a nearby park. When more than 900 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police moved in to chase away the squatters, the protesters were already perched on the wall. They had earlier declared they would seek `` political asylum'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> if West German police tried to remove them. East German border guards helped the protesters over the communist-built barrier, which splits <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> into Allied and communist sectors. Some guards backed trucks up to the eastern side of the wall to make it easier for the environmentalists to jump down and escape <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police. One smiling East German guard helped one protester by pulling his bicycle over the wall. Others greeted cheering protesters with coffee, warm sausages and cigarettes. The protesters were occupying a 10-acre piece of land which formally came under <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s control at one minute after Thursday midnight. Before then, police could not legally enter the area. The property was handed over under a deal worked out with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> this year. The protesters began occupying the land May 26. They set up a shantytown and put up barriers to protect themselves from police. The area became the scene of frequent violent skirmishes between police and demonstrators. Protesters often attacked police with bottles, stones and gasoline bombs. Officers responded with tear gas and water cannons. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly asked protesters to leave the area, saying it could contain live ammunition from World War II. The area, not far from where <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s bunker was located, was the scene of fierce battles in the final days of World War II. Officials have said plans for the proposed highway are not yet finalized and have charged that many of the protesters are intent only on provoking violence with authorities. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state-run newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> last week reported <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police were using `` terror tactics'' against the protesters, indicating offical <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> approval of the environmentalists' actions.

 A prosecutor dropped criminal libel charges against a weekly newspaper editor Friday at the request of two legislators who said the case was causing the poor, rural area too much adverse publicity. State Rep. <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and state Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McGill </PERSON>, whom editor <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> accused of unspecified corruption and stealing, delivered letters to Solicitor <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> on Friday asking him to drop the charges. `` I see no useful purpose in furthering the prosecution of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> said in his letter. `` I realize that vengeance is not mine but God's,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a Baptist minister, wrote, `` God in his own time will rectify all situations.'' <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, who agreed to drop the rarely used counts of criminal libel, said of <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION>: `` Even though both felt seriously harmed, they did n't want to harm -LRB- <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. ... They were distressed by the negative publicity that has made the county look bad.'' <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, the 62-year-old editor of a small weekly newspaper, The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION>, was indicted by a grand jury Monday and faced a possible sentence of a year in jail if he was convicted. He was not immediately available for comment on Friday's action, a newspaper employee said. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, the attorney for the lawmakers, said: `` Nobody ever thought this would reach the proportions that it did. I've never in my 40 years of practice here seen anything that got such national attention. The case set off a legal battle involving First Amendment rights that caught the attention of journalists across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It was only the fourth criminal libel suit involving journalists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 40 years and the first in the nation since 1984. In his column of May 17, <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, who is black, wrote, in part: `` I will say to you, without fear of contradiction, if every black in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> would start stealing today and steal every day for the rest of their lives, they could not steal as much as those two have stolen during their time in power.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, who is black, and <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION>, who is white, signed warrants against <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> shortly after reading the column. The two politicians have denied <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>' charges. But The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Friday that an investigation completed in February by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> concluded that <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, while chairman of a center for mentally retarded adults that he founded in 1976, diverted state grant money and used it for personal benefit. A prosecutor concluded there was not enough evidence of criminal activity to present to a grand jury, the law enforcement division said. <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said the State story had nothing to do with <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s decision to drop the libel charge `` I did n't see that there's anything there -LRB- in the State story -RRB- that would have justified him -LRB- <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> -RRB- saying what he did in the newspaper,'' <PERSON> Connor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> and <PERSON> McGill </PERSON> told him last week that they were going to ask him to drop the charges after the grand jury indictment was unsealed Monday. Although <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> said, `` I trust that the matter will be laid to rest,'' the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is considering asking permission from <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> to ask a judge to declare the state's criminal libel law unconstitional, state <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said Friday `` In any event this whole affair points out the need to abolish the criminal libel statute, because it is an invitation to politicians to intimidate and silence their opponents in an attempt to hide the truth,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said.

 The front stoop and archway of a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment building collapsed Friday, killing two girls and seriously injuring a third, authorities said. The bodies of two girls, one 10 and the other 11, were recovered by rescue workers, according to Lt. <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. A 13-year-old girl was in critical but stable condition with multiple trauma, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, administrator on duty at <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The accident occurred at 3:10 p.m. when decayed ironwork supporting a granite facade and a staircase gave way, officials said. `` They had rotted over the years _ they're 100 years old _ and they had not been adequately maintained and they rusted,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> who visited the scene Friday evening. `` I heard a thud and there was some smoke rising up,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, 30, an emergency technician who lives across the street. `` There were hands reaching out of the rubble. There were hands of a little girl. We were removing the rubble and the next thing I knew the police were right behind us,'' said <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. One elderly woman complained of chest pains when she and about 60 other people were evacuated from the building. She received medical treatment at the scene. The names of the victims were withheld pending notification of relatives.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Attache Transferred After Seized By Customs Agents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Diplomatic sources said Friday that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military attache left <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> after customs agents detained him and claimed he was illegally taking photographs of an Iranian ship in the port of <LOCATION> Setubal </LOCATION>. A newspaper had reported the attache, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>, was expelled but that account was denied by both the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the diplomatic sources, who spoke with condition they not be identified. The sources said the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> government expressed its displeasure to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the incident earlier this year and <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> was transferred in May at the end of a three-year tour of duty. A report in the weekly Independent newspaper had said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> was expelled and left <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> Wednesday. It later acknowleged it might have erred about the date of the attache's departure. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman My <PERSON> Chau </PERSON> <PERSON> Bui-Griffin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in early May following routine transfer orders from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> had served as naval attache in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> since March 1985. She declined comment on the Independent's story. According to the diplomatic sources, <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> was detained by customs agents while photographing an Iranian ship loading arms in <LOCATION> Setubal </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. Setubal is the port where arms sold by Portuguese state-owned companies to both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are loaded for shipment. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. Photographing some state-owned installations is prohibited by Portuguese law. The diplomatic sources did not specify when <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> allegedly was detained, but the state-run television network <ORGANIZATION> RTP </ORGANIZATION> said the incident occurred in the first week of April. It said the government advised <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> not to renew <PERSON> Barney </PERSON>'s posting in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. The Portuguese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the reports. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are allies in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Publisher Says Private Probe Showed Iran Ordered Premier Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A publisher who ran a private investigation into the unsolved 1986 assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> said Friday he believed <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was killed on orders from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ebbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wanted Palme eliminated because he was ending illegal deliveries of Swedish arms to the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government and because he was appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to mediate an end to the Iran-Iraq war. A gunman shot and killed Palme on a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> street on Feb. 28, 1986. Police have failed to establish a motive and have offered a $ 8.3 million reward for the killer. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> is employed at <ORGANIZATION> Bonniers </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s main publishing houses which publishes everything from books to weekly magazines. The disclosure of <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s unofficial probe created a political storm and led to the resignation June 7 of Justice Minister <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lejion </PERSON>, who approved his secret mission and wrote a letter of introduction to foreign intelligence agencies. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said he was pursuing a possible <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> connection to the assassination, a link that police investigated but failed to prove. Critics said <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON>'s maverick operation bordered on the illegal _ his bodyguard was caught smuggling outlawed surveillance equipment into <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> _ and added nothing to the official probe. Breaking his silence over the episode, <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said on Swedish radio: `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is conducting a holy war, where they put everything into the survival of their nation, and they did not want any mediation or meddling.'' He also said, `` I think that <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> was murdered because <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> felt it was more difficult to buy war material since he had become premier -LRB- in 1982 -RRB-.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been at war since September 1980. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> indicated he believed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> contracted the murder to Kurdish extremists living in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> who also had a grudge against Palme. Several reports during the police investigation mentioned a small group of leftist Kurdish exiles known as the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as perhaps organizing the killing. The Kurds are an ethnic group seeking a separate state in part of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The Palme government had classified the group as a terrorist organization and sentenced two of its alleged members to life in prison for the killing of two defectors from the group. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> said police received `` a lot of tips about the behavior of the Kurds in connection with the murder,'' and that `` my simple contribution'' was drawing a possible link between the two theories. Attorney General <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said Friday he would open a preliminary investigation against two <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officers who gave <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> classified information on the Palme case. But Stark, releasing a 42-page report on the <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> incident, cleared the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the national police of irregular behavior.

 The grownups paid $ 40 a ticket without a murmur and the children proved that kids are kids the world over when the Greatest Show on Earth made its debut in this very unfamiliar part of the world on Friday. The Ringling Bros. and <PERSON> Barnum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> <PERSON> Circus </PERSON> roused some familiar reactions even though it was performing 5,000 miles from home. The cavorting clowns and the dancing elephants still helped make the Big Top a big hit. Ringmaster <PERSON> Dinny </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> was ecstatic about the reception here following the afternoon performance and <PERSON> Susannah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president for public relations, said the evening performance `` went even better.'' `` Some of the kids were dancing in the aisles,'' she said. `` We have been prepared for a reserved, quiet crowd. This is not <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said after the first performance. `` But they clapped fervently ... I did not expect them to be as overwhelmingly demonstrative in their response.'' The first Ringling show ever to play in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> opened in a huge tent in this northern city, its first time under canvas in 32 years, won the hearts of a reserved but less-than-capacity audience of about 4,000 people. After slow start, the audience warmed to the troupe and applauded enthusiastically. `` I told you this during the dress rehersal, but today was the real test because we had real people _ and they loved it,'' circus owner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> told the 200 members of his troupe after the show. `` You really are ` the greatest show on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,''' <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> has brought an all new version of the 118-year-old show to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as an experiment. It will give 44 performances in <LOCATION> Sapporo </LOCATION>, then 96 shows in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in August and September. <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> said the circus will go on to play in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in October before returning home. The testing of the Japanese entertainment waters comes at a time when the Bolshoi Circus from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, already well-known here, also is touring <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> says the Soviets `` do n't compare with us. They're very plodding. They ca n't match our rhythm and tempo. That's the secret. Tempo.'' The Ringling tour of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is being promoted locally by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which asked <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> to bring a show as big as the two Ringling troupes touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said show publicist <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>. <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> also liked the idea because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a wealthy nation that can afford hefty admission prices, <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> said. Adult tickets went for $ 40, about four times the average price in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> created a new `` gold unit'' with the best of the acts from the `` blue'' and `` red'' units touring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and world-class acts from other countries. To help audiences here understand the acts, ringmaster <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> had to learn his introductions and explanations in Japanese. Also, Japanese characters were put on many of the clown costumes to identify them to the children. Finally, `` we brought in 120 kids last week'' for a dry run, <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We ... went through the clown routines to find out what worked and what did n't.'' <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> said the production cost $ 10 million, including $ 8 million for the tent. After Friday's matinee, a smiling Mrs. <PERSON> Sachiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Okawara </PERSON>, asked about performance, said she liked `` The performers, the animals, the costumes, the lights _ and the band. The band was beautiful.'' For 5-year-old <PERSON> Miku </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusakabo </PERSON>, the list of favorite items was much shorter: `` The elephants,'' she said through an interpreter, and nodded vigorously when asked if she wanted to come back again.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> marked the 67th anniversary Friday of the founding of its <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> by issuing a new party theoretical journal and by cautioning the 47 million party members that their mission is a serious one. `` Each member from the day he joins the party is constantly tested,'' the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said in a front-page editorial. `` As times change, so do the tasks and the tests.'' It said members' main tasks now are to uphold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s market-style economic reforms and fight growing corruption that has accompanied the new prosperity `` There are a handful of members, including some officials ... who instead of using their power to benefit the people and the country abuse it for personal gains,'' the paper said. `` We must resolutely expel -LRB- them -RRB-.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> convened its first congress on July 1, 1921, at a girls' school in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s foreign quarter. When police got word of the session, delegates fled to nearby <LOCATION> Hangzhou </LOCATION> and finished their meeting in a boat on a scenic lake, posing as holiday-makers. Fewer and fewer members today are interested in Marxist ideology, as evidenced by the creation of the new, livelier party journal. The old party bi-monthly, Red Flag -LRB- Hong Qi -RRB-, which put out its last issue in June, carried lengthy, jargon-laden essays on such topics as the relationship between art and the masses and `` Basing Planning Work On the Foundation of the Law of Value.'' The new journal, called Seek Truth -LRB- Qiu Shi -RRB-, takes its name from senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s pragmatic slogan, `` Seek truth from facts.'' He advanced the slogan in the 1970s as a counterpoint to <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s emphasis on theory and the ideology of class struggle.

 More than 100,000 cases of AIDS have been reported worldwide, with more than half of them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The Geneva-based group said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> listed 65,099 AIDS cases, the highest national total and a 5.7 percent increase in 2 -LCB- months. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate of 8.9 cases per 100,000 is the highest in the industrialized world. <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> said 138 countries reported a total of 100,410 cases by June 30. The May 30 total stood at 96,433 cases worldwide. Organization officials, however, estimate there are more than 150,000 cases and that 5 million to 10 million people may carry the HIV virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. According to the WHO figures, AIDS cases were registered for the first time in <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>, which had three cases, and the islands of <ORGANIZATION> Comoros </ORGANIZATION>, which had one case. A special survey of 30 European nations said that male homosexuals made up 56 percent of AIDS victims, followed by intravenous drug abusers at 21 percent and heterosexuals at 7 percent. The breakdown varied among individual nations. Among AIDS victims in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the share of drug abusers was only 2 percent, while that of homosexuals was 84 percent. In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, 54 percent were drug abusers and 23 percent were homosexuals. AIDS is caused by a virus that wrecks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> in the 14th round Friday, cutting the world champion's lead in World Chess Cup competition to one game. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> resigned on his 38th move.

The two Soviet players' bitter personal and professional rivalry has stretched over a record series of matches totaling 129 games _ 19 victories for <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, 17 for <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> and the rest draws. <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, 25, took the championship from <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON>, who is 12 years older.

 An earthquake rattled parts of the <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert Friday and was felt as far south as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, but police had no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The 5:26 p.m. earthquake registered 4.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered 23 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, near the town of <LOCATION> Borrego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. `` It was just like a rolling feeling.

A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in the local area, but authorities throughout the desert reported no damage or injuries. The Richter scale gauges gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude.

 The military and news reports said Friday that attacks throughout the country killed a physician, two government officials, a former political candidate and a 12-year-old bystander. In <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, two men barged into the clinic of Dr. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> Thursday night and shot him in front of his wife, military reports said. Also Thursday in Angeles, two gunmen killed district council member <PERSON> Almario </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiambao </PERSON> as he walked with his wife on a street, the reports said. The shootings brought to 35 the number of people killed in the past two months in the town, home to the sprawling <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the killings have been attributed to leftist and right-wing extremists. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> town, 10 miles from <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, communist guerrillas aboard a truck overtook a government patrol jeep and fired on the troops, military reports said. The soldiers fired back and killed one rebel, the reports said, adding that a 12-year-old boy on a bicycle nearby died in the cross fire. Four militiamen and a soldier were wounded, the military reports said. Thursday's other slayings were in the village of <LOCATION> Pandanon </LOCATION> on the central Philippine island of <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency quoted a police report as saying six men shot <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdato </PERSON>, a defeated vice mayoralty candidate in nearby <LOCATION> Murcia </LOCATION> town. The gunmen then turned their fire on village council member <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Conlu </PERSON> and killed him, <ORGANIZATION> PNA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Conlu </PERSON> had been nearby and was rushing to investigate, the agency added. On Friday, gunmen fired on a barrack of army musicians at a military camp, breaking windows but causing no casualties, officials said. Officers at Camp Crame, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the attackers and their car vanished.

 A lawsuit against a blood bank filed by an AIDS victim who became a spokeswoman for others with the disease has been settled out of court 1 -LCB- years after her death, an attorney said. A condition of the settlement between the family of <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> was that the amount would not be disclosed, said attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> Sr..

Mrs. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> learned she had AIDS in 1984, the same week she realized she was pregnant. She gave birth to a healthy son in 1985. The lawsuit claimed she contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from a blood transfusion she received in 1982 while being treated at Home Hospital for ulcerative colitis. She sued the hospital, the blood center and two doctors with the blood center in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON> had discussed her disease on national television, before state officials and in other forums, saying her goal was `` to get some help for those people who are sick. ...

 The burning roof of a car dealership collapsed onto firefighters Friday, killing five of them in a shower of fiery debris, authorities said. The fire, which destroyed the building and contents of <ORGANIZATION> Hackensack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, apparently started shortly after 3 p.m. in the ceiling space above the rear service section of the building, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said the roof collapsed as the firefighters inside the building were cutting a hole in the false ceiling in order to attack flames between the ceiling and the roof. `` All of a sudden the entire 60 foot square inside ceiling fell on them,'' he said, adding that four other firefighters inside at the time escaped injury. <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said the men were spraying the space between the ceiling and the roof trying to create a `` fog'' to decrease the heat of the fire. `` They did what they were supposed to do,'' he said. Killed were Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhogen </PERSON>, firefighters <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Krejsa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Radumski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON>, officials said.

All the dealership's employees were evacuated without injuries, a <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION> police spokesman said. The fire was under control by 6:30 p.m. All of <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>'s 100 firefighters answered the alarm, as well as units from surrounding towns. Fire investigtors were picking through the debris to try and determine the cause of the fire, but <PERSON> Aiellos </PERSON> said the roof collapse may make it impossible to find the exact cause. Witnesses said a series of explosions rocked the building shortly after the fire began.

<TEXT>
 Conservation groups applauded a decision Friday by the international timber industry to promote environment-conscious logging in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, the world's largest tropical rainforest The U.S.-based World Wildlife Fund said the decision _ the first of its kind by the timber industry _ could slow destruction of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rainforest, a key regulator of the world's weather. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, an association of 42 producing and consuming countries, approved a $ 4 million logging and conservation project in the remote jungle state of Acre, on <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, 2,800 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. The project calls for `` integrated'' development of jungle products, such as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> nuts and rubber, as well as timber. It also calls for loggers to consult with environmental groups, government agencies, native Indians and local workers to plan long-term development to preserve the rainforest. `` This was the big one. We hope the Acre project can serve as a model not just for the rest of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> but for all tropical forests,'' <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, press spokesman for the World Wildlife Fund, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> at the end of a 10-day meeting of the Timber Organization. The organization's members control 95 percent of the world's $ 5.6 billion tropical timber trade As timber trade shifts away from the shrinking forests of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the mahogany-rich <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> is seen as the next great source of hardwood. But conservationists are worried about the effect on the climate of uncontrolled logging in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> basin, a 2 million square-mile region as large as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that covers parts of seven <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries and contains a third of the world's rainforest Already the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> forest is disappearing at the rate of some 27 million acres a year, mostly at the hands of small farmers and ranchers who cut and burn the trees, <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said. `` The rainforest is a gaseous sink for carbon dioxide. The trees soak it up. If we cut them down, there's no way to get rid of the gas. And that contributes to the greenhouse effect,'' he said. The greenhouse effect is a gradual warming of the Earth's surface because of excessive carbon dioxide and pollutants in the atmosphere that trap the sun's heat, like a greenhouse It is thought to be a possible cause of the current drought in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The Acre project, which will get about $ 3 million from the Brazilan government and the rest from the <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, is the largest approved since the organization was founded in 1986. Smaller conservation programs, similar to the Acre project, were approved for <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. Other proposals approved at the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> meeting were: _ Development of a `` news market service,'' to help producing countries market better _ Standardization of timber specifications among member countries, to cut waste caused by conflicting measurements _ Improvement of harvesting and processing equipment The next meeting of the organization is scheduled for November in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 Youngsters and workers at a children's shelter bade farewell Friday to the partially deaf boy who was reunited with his mother this week after an eight-month separation. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON> _ known to the world as <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> before Tuesday's reunion with his mother _ passed out pieces of angel food cake to children, social workers and reporters gathered at the going-away party at the shelter where he had been staying since last November. A handwritten sign on a wall read: `` Adios Jesus -LRB- <PERSON> Sabath </PERSON> -RRB-.'' The boy, nicknamed <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON>, had started packing early for the bus ride Friday night with his mother and aunt to his hometown of <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> about 300 miles south of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON> caused a stir after he was picked up Nov. 7 near downtown Juarez because he could not convey his identity or his hometown. He speaks only a few words and communicates mostly through gestures and drawings. Because he seemed to like <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> food, Mexican child welfare authorities contacted their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterparts, thinking the child might be an American. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> even got involved in the effort to identify him. But his family was eventually traced, and he was reunited Tuesday with his mother, <PERSON> Micaela </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. She said the boy, one of five children, had run away while on a trip to visit his father in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>. Before he left Friday, <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON> ran around the playroom at the children's shelter, eagerly handing pieces of cake to social workers, reporters and about 20 playmates. Then he walked shyly to his mother and thrust out a piece of cake at arm's length. Social worker <PERSON> Leticia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cota </PERSON> stood in a doorway, watching <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON> hug his friends and pose for pictures. `` I'm glad to see him back with his family, but it's sad to see him go,'' she said. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, director general of the Juarez office of Integrated Family Development, said welfare authorities were considering putting <PERSON> Chuy </PERSON> into a shelter in <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION> because of the conditions the family lived in. Ms. <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON> had previously told people that she worked as a maid. But when officials in <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION> visited the family's home this week and interviewed neighbors, they discovered the family's living quarters were cramped and that Ms. <PERSON> Aguilera </PERSON> worked late hours as a waitress in a bar, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said. `` It's better this way,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said, adding that Ms. <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON> would be allowed to see her children if they are put in a shelter. `` We're here to protect children, not to protect the parents.''

 Researchers have nearly halted the progression of multiple sclerosis in some patients for up to four years by aiming radiation at specific sites in the body, a new study says. The four-year response is longer than any seen with other experimental therapies, scientists said. The radiation was aimed at depleting the body's supply of white blood cells that are believed to cause symptoms of the disease by attacking nerve tissue. An estimated 250,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, an often crippling condition that can include weakness, difficulty in coordination, dizziness, and loss of balance. Patients in the study had chronic progressive MS, an unremitting form that steadily worsens. The disease also has an `` exacerbating-remitting'' form, in which a patient suffers isolated attacks.

<TEXT>
 Silence has greeted <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brook </PERSON>'s lavish nine-hour odyssey based on the rambling Indian epic `` The Mahabharata,'' but for the cast, the silence is golden. Playing to nearly packed houses in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the last stop of a year-long worldwide tour, <PERSON> Brook </PERSON>'s adaptation of good's triumph over evil pits two warring clans in ferocious battle to gain control of a vast ancient Indian kingdom. The epic, which comprises the world's longest poem, narrates a way of life in its dealings with feelings of hatred, love and jealousy _ basic human emotions often hidden under a polite facade. Audiences in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> have responded with awkward, embarrassed laughter. `` That has been true with many audiences all over the world,'' said <PERSON> Malika </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarabhai </PERSON>, the only Indian national in the performance. `` We used to get very upset in the beginning. `` In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, they laughed at everything,'' said <PERSON> Sarabhai </PERSON>, an accomplished dancer-actress in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` Anytime when there was something tense going on stage, they would laugh ... because they are embarrassed. They do n't like ... to be confronted with very deep, very basic emotions.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the silence has been louder; the Japanese audience has laughed the least. Many Japanese, <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> said, have discovered that `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is really the root of their culture.'' <PERSON> Kenichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirahama </PERSON>, a theater critic and author of several books on plays, said `` The Mahabharata'' has allowed the Japanese `` to re-evaluate the meaning of life.'' `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has drawn its culture from the centuries-old traditions of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and especially <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' he said, `` but in their pursuit of money, the Japanese have forgotten how to live. `` By watching the play, the people are reminded of the richness of life and human nature.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for an eight-week engagement as part of the six-month Festival of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, `` The Mahabharata'' has earned rave reviews from the local media, and <LOCATION> Saison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION> personnel say tickets for the nine-hour marathon sessions were sold out well in advance before the opening last month. Originally written in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit, the epic under <PERSON> Brook </PERSON>'s direction is staged in English and lines up a multinational cast of 50 people from over 15 different countries. The cast of the <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatreales </ORGANIZATION> company, based in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, has already toured in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Ironically, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has not been part of its itinerary. <PERSON> Marie-Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Estienne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brook </PERSON>'s assistant, blamed the logistics of transporting a company of 50 plus into a nation notorious for its red tape, but said a movie on the play, next on the director's agenda, will open in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> by September 1989 Doordarshan, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s government-run TV network, will sponsor the play's move to celluloid and will also cast the same group of actors, with one notable difference: The play will be cut to six hours, `` the shortest length of time in which the story can be told,'' <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> said. Doordarshan, he added, initially wanted only two hours. The epic is played out an a stage packed with dry earth, complete with a pond in the front and a rippling stream in the back. Outdoor and indoor scenes within acts are signaled by changing floor mats, brought out by the actors themselves doubling as stagehands. The story is about two groups of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, who fight over control of an ancient Indian kingdom. The climax of the story is an 18-day battle, in which the Pandavas, representing good, are victorious. Around this core are woven thousands of subplots, which nearly fill an entire encyclopedia of 18 books. `` The play is very true to ` The Mahabharata,' very true to the spirit,'' <PERSON> Sarabhai </PERSON> said. `` Had I not been proud of the production both as an Indian and as a woman, I do n't think I would have stayed party to it.''

 Environmentalists are mobilizing to save what's left of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s once-vast <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> forest, the nation's picture-postcard front door. One of the species of trees near extinction is the brazilwood, or pau-Brazil, which gave the country its name. When Portuguese explorers discovered <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 1500, the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> forest covered some 170,000 square miles along a 3,000-mile coastal strip. Today, with 80 million of the country's 143 million people and most of its heavy industry crowded into the coastal zone, only about 3 percent of the original primary forest remains _ in scattered patches. Some of the forest's rare monkeys, birds and trees, many found nowhere else in the world, face extinction. `` We are in the process of destroying an entire ecosystem. But there's still time to save what's left and prevent total tragedy,'' said <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON>, the chairman of a group called the S.O.S. <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The foundation has strong economic and political influence. <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> is an heir of the family that for a century has controlled the influential <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and media group. Others running S.O.S. include two multimillionaire industrialists, the president of the country's largest university and a retired admiral. Since 1986, the foundation has raised the equivalent of more than $ 4 million for nationwide newspaper and television publicity. It intends to collect more, for the satellite mapping of the forest zone and for actual conservation programs where the remaining forest is thickest. `` This group is powerful and well organized,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON>, international vice chairman of the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund and a consultant to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> organization. `` It's not radical, as unfortunately was the case with many well meaning but ineffective environmental groups that sprang up in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1960s. I'm very optimistic.'' <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> has been coming to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> since 1971, principally to work with <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> forest's endangered monkey species. He said in an interview in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> probably has the best chance for success of the `` three highest-priority ecological problems in the world'' _ the tropical <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andes </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>; the African island of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> forest. `` Here in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> forest it really is possible to save the remnants,'' <PERSON> Mittermeier </PERSON> said. He mentioned specifically the muriqui, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest primate, of which fewer than 100 remain; the Golden Lion Tamarin, another endangered monkey, with about 400 left; the increasingly scarce red-tailed parrot; the rare and valuable jacaranda tree, and the almost extinct pau-Brazil. `` Today, with few exceptions, the only place you can still see pau-Brasil is in a botanical garden,'' lamented <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON>. Early Portuguese pioneers chopped down all the brazilwood they could find to extract dye. Later settlers hacked away the coastal forest to make way for sugar-cane and coffee plantations and for settlements. The S.O.S. <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>'s logotype is a stylized green-yellow-and-blue Brazilian flag, but with part of the green ripped away. A foundation poster shows a map of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> with an outline of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> as it existed in 1500, with the words, in <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>, `` I Used to be Like This.'' Then there is a map showing the scattered forest pockets left today and the words, `` I Wound Up Like This.'' The foundation's first specific project is to be in a still-relatively untouched forest zone covering 3,500 square miles along the coasts of the southeastern states of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Parana </LOCATION>. It intends to set up two ecological bases and buy a patrol-type boat to sound the alarm against illegal tree cutting and the banned netting of coastal fish, shrimp and oysters. `` Invasion of that region has long gone unpunished,'' S.O.S. Chairman <PERSON> Mesquita </PERSON> said. `` But we think we can stop it. We're organized, we've got money, and we have access to the authorities and the media. The foundation also supported lobby efforts in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to place in the draft of a new constitution the legal concept of `` ecological crime.'' `` We're also attempting a process of environmental education,'' said <PERSON> Ibsen </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gusmao </PERSON> <PERSON> Camara </PERSON>, the former admiral who now is a member of the S.O.S board. `` A lot of Brazilians think development automatically means physical occupation. It's not that they purposely want to destroy the environment. They just do n't know any better.'' `` We'll never see the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> forest again as it once was,'' he added. `` That's impossible. But we will put a stop to the destruction and preserve and build up the forest's ` genetic library'.''

 Two public television documentaries this week give names and faces and unique stories to a part of the population that is often faceless, especially on TV _ the elderly. One of the films is an uplifting fairytale romance, the Academy Award-winning short documentary `` Young at Heart,'' airing Wednesday. The other is a realistic profile of six elderly women. `` Acting Our Age'' is half of the two-hour premiere installment Tuesday night of `` P.O.V.,'' standing for `` point of view,'' a new documentary series on PBS. The film is by <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Aviad </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> filmmaker who decided to examine the effects of aging, both physically and psychologically, on a half-dozen thoughtful and intelligent women coping with different lifestyles _ married, divorced and widowed, some lonely, some not. `` There's nobody that's young that's not going to get old, unless they die,'' says <PERSON> Enola </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, 66, one of the women Ms. <PERSON> Aviad </PERSON> profiles. Ms. <PERSON> Aviad </PERSON> allows her subjects to speak for themselves; as a result they are portrayed sympathetically but realistically. Mrs. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> is surrounded by an extended family, but <PERSON> Irja </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, 74, is struggling with loneliness. `` The older I get, the fewer chances I have, and the ones that I had I rejected. It's painful not to be wanted, and I found that you just simply have to do without No one wants you for a spouse or a mate or a lover.'' Not the case for the adoring couple profiled in `` Young at Heart,'' Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>, which won this year's Academy Award as best short-subject documentary. It is a bald-faced love story with a happy ending. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gothelf </PERSON>, 85, and <PERSON> Reva </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON>, 84, two artists _ he paints portraits, she paints flowers she grows in her garden _ found that being old does n't mean an end to romance. The film was made by <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gothelf </PERSON>'s daughter, and <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Conn. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gothelf </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> met when they went on a painting tour of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and were seated next to each other on the plane They talked all the way. Once they arrived, it sounded like something of a twist on `` A Room with a View.'' <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> had a large room with lovely scenery out the window. Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> was stuck with closet-like accommodations. She showed up at his door with her luggage, and the rest was history. They decided to live together, because as Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> says, `` When you're young you should get married. But when you're old, what difference does it make?'' The film is captivating in its simplicity. Gothelf and Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> are two wise, funny people whose bodies might be old, but whose minds are young and open. Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> has an especially good line that will likely end up tacked on a lot of walls _ `` Housework is the worst enemy of an artist.'' The camera follows the couple to an art gallery where they both coo over a <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> portrait, but later argue the relative merits of various examples of modern art. Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> points out that <PERSON> Gothelf </PERSON> learned to paint in the'20 and'30s, but she did n't begin until the 1950s, so she has a more modern view. Later in the film, we learn that <PERSON> Gothelf </PERSON>'s wife had Alzheimer's disease, a progressive disorder that affects the mind He cared for her through 10 years of sickness before she died. Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> had lost her entire family. Her son died of cancer in his 40s. Then her husband passed away. Her other son later drowned while scuba diving. <PERSON> Gothelf </PERSON> shows a portrait he painted of Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> a few weeks after the tragedy. He could n't get her to smile. In one of the film's loveliest scenes, he paints a new portrait, this time with Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> where she's happiest, at her easel. Sitting together in the evening, cocktails in hand, Mrs. <PERSON> Shwayder </PERSON> sums up the sentiment that leads the two to a marriage, documented in the film: `` We're both getting older,'' she says. `` I hope if anything happens to him, I'll be able to take care of him, and if anything happens to me, he'll take care of me. That's what I call love.'' This is what viewers will call a very nice program.

 The television documentary, much neglected in recent years, gets a special 10-week showcase on public television beginning tonight. The summer series `` P.O.V.'' _ filmmaker jargon for point of view _ will present a selection from among the best documentaries produced in recent years by independent filmmakers. `` Each film has a point of view,'' said executive producer <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` That makes them more interesting. People can look at them and agree or disagree.'' The first two-hour program presents two documentaries: `` American Tongues,'' by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolker </PERSON>, takes a humorous look at how American speech varies from region to region. The film won a Peabody Award this spring. The second film is `` Acting Our Age,'' by <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Aviad </PERSON>, a paean to the spirit of six elderly women facing life and advancing age. The premiere also includes previews of the other documentaries. `` We're going to show 12 documentaries during the 10 weeks,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` We looked at an extraordinary number of documentaries to make our selection. When we asked for submissions we got 500 entries. `` That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are more than 25,000 independent filmmakers in this country. They're not all turning out films all the time. It takes several years. They have difficulty raising money. The very best documentaries get made because the filmmaker got a bug. They latched onto something. They feel very passionate about the subject they're filming. It's something they want to explore.'' Public television commissions only about a dozen documentaries a year outside of the venues of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> and other nature films. Documentaries once flourished on the three commercial networks but have been virtually replaced by newsmagazine shows. The only real sanctuary for the documentary today is cable TV's Discovery Channel, which offers 18 hours a day of documentaries concerning nature, science, technology, history, human adventure and world exploration Documentaries are also occasionally shown in theaters. The <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sciences awards Oscars each year for best feature and short-subject documentaries. `` This whole thing had its genesis at a film festival in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> about a year and a half ago,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON> of ` Frontline' mentioned during a discussion that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s fourth channel had bought a lot of documentaries by independent American filmmakers. An executive of the British channel said they have such a backlog of films that they're running them as a special package. `` After the discussion, I went to Fanning with the idea that we should do something similar here. He said the only way it would work is if we had a consortium of stations behind it.'' Fanning arranged a meeting of <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Becton </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> WGBH </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, vice president for public affairs of PBS. It ended up with `` P.O.V.'' having the same board of directors and stations as `` American Playhouse.'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> pointed out that the primary audience for most documentaries has been at schools and libraries. `` Very few filmmakers make any money,'' he said. `` They do it because they care about a subject. Many fall by the wayside because they have n't got the money. On the other hand, that kind of tenacity is what makes these films extraordinary. All of the work has an emotional punch and plenty of intellectual meat. `` Filmmakers only get a few shots. That's why they pick their subjects so carefully. And they're independent because they do n't want to comform to a format. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, who has been an independent filmmaker much of his career, said he hopes `` P.O.V.'' will lead to a series. `` People need to know when to tune in,'' he said. `` It needs some consistency. We're issuing a viewer's guide to help people find this current series. He said he believes `` P.O.V.'' will attract viewers who quit regular television because they have found nothing to interest them. `` People are pretty bored with the documentaries they see on the networks,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is desperately searching for a recipe for success following its third electoral drubbing in a year, when just a little over a decade ago it came close to winning power. Their most recent setback came at the end of June when they lost ground in local elections in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` This is one of the most difficult moments in our history,'' said <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON>, the new leader of the party, which is the largest <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second largest political party. The Communists' dramatic decline reportedly helped force out the 70-year-old <PERSON> Alessandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Natta </PERSON> as the party leader. His resignation, following a heart attack, marked the first time in the party's history that a Communist leader had stepped down in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON>, 52, inherited a party divided over its identity and unsure how to appeal to an electorate, which is less blue-collar and more conservative than in the past. `` We've said we do n't want to follow the Russians, the -LRB- Italian -RRB- Socialists or the Americans,'' said a Communist senator, <PERSON> Stojan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spetic </PERSON>. `` We're still searching for an answer.'' The prolonged search has hurt the Communists' morale _ and their popularity. A year ago, the Italian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ known as the PCI, its initials in Italian _ suffered its worst defeat in parliamentary elections in 20 years, slipping to 26.6 percent of the vote. In May, the Communists dropped to 21.9 percent of the vote in local elections, down from 25.8 percent in 1983. The balloting in late June in the north reduced their share of the vote in two regions from 19.8 percent to 15.7 percent. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of former Premier <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> has surged, challenging the Communists for leadership of the left. Many Communists are pinning their hopes for revival on Occhetto. <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON> is `` perfectly conscious of the necessity and the urgency of creating a new PCI,'' said <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION>, the left-leaning <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> newspaper. One of the party's pillars, the blue-collar working class, has declined in number during <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s economic and technological boom. Young people who traditionally voted heavily for the Communists are now spreading their votes among different parties. `` Today's young people do n't have idealistic values,'' Sen. <PERSON> Spetic </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They are much more pragmatic. They want work, careers.'' In a speech to party members, <PERSON> Occhetto </PERSON> noted the shrinkage in the party's traditional bases of support and said this `` puts in question even us, and it is from this consideration that we ought to draw our new course.'' It would not be the first time the Italian Communists changed course. In the 1970s, Communist leader <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlinguer </PERSON> proclaimed the party's independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Gone were the days when the party was known as `` the other church'' with its `` pope'' in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>; Italian Communists sought to achieve power through the democratic system. The party, which had been kept out of the government since 1947, won 34 percent of the votes in the 1976 elections _ just four points below the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Berlinguer </PERSON> was unable to persuade the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to give him Cabinet seats, and he had to settle for being consulted on major issues. Since then, the Socialists have enhanced their reputation as an alternative through <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>'s position as head of the governing coalition for three years, up to mid-1987. Since the death of the charismatic <PERSON> Berlinguer </PERSON> in 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has wrestled over what kind of alternative it should be. Party officials talked of re-examining its revolutionary roots, or seeking a social <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> line _ perhaps even changing its name. A poll by <PERSON> L'Espresso </PERSON> magazine of 234 Communist supporters who had voted recently for a different party indicated that the largest group _ 30 percent _ complained of the lack of a clear <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> political line. An invigorated brand of communism in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has not given new luster to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s party. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s criticism of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and rejection of some Marxist principles have been seen as indictments of the history of the Italian party, which supported <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in its early days. `` It is the lethal combination of the Craxi -LRB- Socialist -RRB- effect and the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> effect which has thrown the PCI against the ropes,'' <PERSON> Enzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bettiza </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> deputy from the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, wrote in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stampa </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Palestinian singers usually known for sentimental love songs have found a new kind of music: political anthems calling for violent revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and glorifying young <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> stone-throwers. Israeli authorities have blacklisted the songs on grounds they incite rebellion, but they are distributed secretly in recorded form and are heard widely in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The current No. 1 hit, `` Insurrection,'' urges <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> children to `` rise up with your stones.'' It booms from music stores and portable radios in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police or soldiers are not around. In <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, junior high school students came from classes recently chanting the refrain of the song `` Intefadeh'' -LRB- Arabic for uprising -RRB-: `` With firebombs and stones, I make my revolution.'' Arab youths also gather around stereos at home and sing along to ballads such as `` Palestinian,'' whose lyrics say: `` I fight for my identity, I fight for freedom, I fight for spring.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police have raided several music stores, confiscated tapes of songs about the uprising and charged store owners with incitement. In the occupied territories, troops confiscate tapes of banned song if they find any during house searches, but they do n't look specially for them, said a military official. `` We act whenever we can, but this is not our first priority. We are too busy with other things.'' Since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, dozens of militant, anti-Israeli songs have surfaced in the occupied lands. They range from mournful ballads about the more than 200 Palestinians killed in clashes to stirring anthems glorifying teen-age stonethrowers. Intefadeh songs are recorded in makeshift studios in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, taped from Syrian television or smuggled from Arab countries. Some tapes are sold under the counter in music stores, while others are copied at home and passed along to friends. Among the two most popular song collections are `` I Am The Son of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'' by the Syrian band `` Palestine Roots'' and `` Intefadeh'' by <PERSON> Riad </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a singer from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. `` Palestine Roots'' also sings `` Insurrection,'' while <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> has recorded `` Palestinian.'' Awad and others are part of the so-called `` Western wave,'' a new musical style popular among the young. It builds on Arabic music traditions, but also uses synthesizers and electrical guitars, placing greater emphasis on rhythm. Palestinian music store owners say that before the uprising, sentimental love songs were the top sellers. `` Today, 95 percent of my customers ask for intefadeh or nationalistic songs,'' said an east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> music store owner. His store was raided earlier in June after he played `` Insurrection'' over loudspeakers. Police confiscated dozens of intefadeh tapes and charged the owner with incitement. He was released on bail the equivalent to $ 1,300. Since the raid, he has restocked his supply, keeping the tapes in two small boxes under the counter. But he no longer plays intefadeh songs loudly, and scrutinizes customers to make sure they are not undercover police officers. Distribution of intefadeh songs is often unorthodox. A friend of the Jerusalem-born Palestinian singer <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurd </PERSON> recently made the rounds of the music stores, carrying a single copy of Kurd's latest tape `` The Children of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Shopowners who wanted it made copies in their stores. At a music store in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, `` Insurrection'' was booming from loudspeakers one recent day, mingling with the sales pitches of street vendors in the cobblestone street. Riot police patrolled nearby, but took no notice. `` I play this because I believe in it,'' said the store owner. `` When the cops come, I just change the tape.'' He added that he was free on bail after being charged with incitement following a raid. Military officials said all songs and written material calling for violent revolt against the 21-year Israeli occupation are illegal and subject to confiscation. However, the officials added, military officers have not compiled a list of banned material because they ca n't keep up with the number of intefadeh songs flooding the occupied territories. But the songs also have their critics in the Palestinian community. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Barghouti </PERSON>, a literature teacher at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said most have little to do with art. `` Art is buried in these songs. What remains is sloganism,'' said <PERSON> Barghouti </PERSON> who writes songs for a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> band. `` As a human being, you are touched only on a superficial ideological level.'' He added that the quality of the songs might improve if they were written by the young activists confronting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers with their stones and slingshots. `` But the kids are too busy to write songs,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Fengqi </PERSON> remembers living on a people's farm commune and being so poor he had neither a table to eat from nor a bed to sleep on Today he has his own family farm, and he's rich by Chinese standards Thus it is that the 50-year-old <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> scoffs at the idea being tossed around in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s capital, that tiny family farms in some areas should gradually give way to more efficient large-scale cooperative ventures. `` The peasants wo n't support group farming,'' he said. `` They would resist.'' Nine years ago, <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>'s production brigade secretly defied the commune and government policy by dividing up its land and letting each farmer be responsible for growing his own share. Production took off, and <LOCATION> Fengyang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s agricultural heartland of <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> province, became a national pioneer in the family contract system that has revolutionized the Chinese countryside Again leading the nation, by 1982 all 45 communes in <LOCATION> Fengyang </LOCATION>, each with about 10,000 people, had been broken up. Today, as the first decade of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s agricultural reform closes, the system is praised for lifting tens of millions out of poverty. But serious doubts have arisen about the future ability of family farmers to feed this country of 1 billion people. For example, farmers paid artificially low prices for state-bought grain are planting more lucrative vegetables and fruit, leading to three straight discouraging grain harvests after a record 407-million-ton crop in 1984. Land under cultivation has decreased and irrigation systems, once kept up by communal labor, have fallen into disrepair. Some experts maintain that the family farmer, on his average 1.5 acres of land, has outlived his usefulness. Rural residents, millions of whom now are finding jobs in small factories in the countryside, are being encouraged to cede their land to professionals or groups who can carry out mechanized farming on larger tracts. Some areas are experimenting with allowing farmers to lease land to more ambitious tillers of the soil. In <LOCATION> Fengyang </LOCATION>, however, `` the conditions are not ripe for large-scale group farming,'' said a local official, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeyuan </PERSON>. Few factory jobs are available in an area where 500,000 of 580,000 people are farmers, he said, and group farming still brings up memories of the `` leftist mistakes'' and `` extreme poverty'' of the past. Under the newly devised cooperative system, farmers who voluntarily form a cooperative may do so and the state is now encouraging this in some areas. Rural residents who find jobs in factories can turn over their land to other farmers, but since the land all belongs to the state, normally they would not be paid for use of it. A few areas, however, are experimenting in allowing farmers to lease land and receive benefits from future crops. Although the state owns the land, it has assured farmers that it will not evict them against their will to form larger farm groups. Farmer <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> does n't like the concept and wants to continue as he is because he and others in <LOCATION> Fengyand </LOCATION> have come so far along. He said he earned 30 fen -LRB- 8 cents -RRB- a day working on the commune, and `` even though we worked a whole year we only had food for half a year.'' Begging, common in <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION> for centuries, continued after the Communist takeover in 1949, and during the hard times, people starved, he said. In 1979, in the first year of the family contract system in his village, <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> claimed, he and his eight children produced more than the entire 98-member work brigade turned out in the past. Last year his extended family earned 17,000 yuan -LRB- $ 4,600 -RRB- from grain and other crops, before expenses. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> said 17 of the 19 households in the village now have brick homes, and their former mud homes are used as cowsheds. About half have television sets, and many have tape recorders and electric fans. Down a rocky dirt road, <LOCATION> Gao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mingzhen </LOCATION>, 32, recalled how her relatives received 110 yuan -LRB- $ 30 -RRB- a month raising geese on the commune. Last year, she said, her goose and chicken farm took in 150,000 yuan -LRB- $ 40,500 -RRB-, of which she reinvested 87,000 yuan -LRB- $ 23,500 -RRB- in four incubators. She also bought two trucks, is installing a refrigerator house and a hatchery, and last year financed her own trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He Xizhang, a county magistrate, spoke proudly of the achievements made under the family contract system. `` Our history in <LOCATION> Fengyang </LOCATION> is one of going from begging to coping to contributing to the country,'' he said. He added that the area, once dependent on the state for grain and other handouts, now exports food to other parts of the country. Grain production has grown steadily, from 163,000 tons in 1978 to 540,000 tons in 1987. The annual per capital income in that period climbed from 81 yuan -LRB- $ 22 -RRB- to 480 yuan -LRB- $ 130 -RRB-, on a par with farmers nationwide. Farmers must sell a contracted amount of their grain crop, usually about 40 percent, to the state at fixed prices, but can sell the rest on the free market at prices about 20 percent higher. Electricity, available to almost no farmers in 1978, now reaches almost every home; half the farmers have brick houses. Not all in <LOCATION> Fengyang </LOCATION> are properly clothed, Magistrate He said, and some live in three-story homes while others still are in mud huts. But `` people feel deeply that the reforms have brought them prosperity.'' Nonetheless, primitive methods are still used on family farms. Women in conical straw hats plant rice stalk by stalk; men plow fields behind plodding water buffalo. Irrigation, crucial in this area plagued by alternating drought and flood, is done either by operating small wooden pumps or tossing water from one paddy to another by bucket. Some farmers, lacking threshing facilitities, lay their wheat across the highways to let passing trucks help separate the grain from the chaff. Like elsewhere in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, family farmers in <LOCATION> Fengyang </LOCATION> worry about rising prices and must struggle to obtain fertilizer, pesticides and diesel fuel, which are in short supply and often fall into the hands of speculators or those with political influence. Agricultural official <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> said the province can supply only 70 percent of fertilizer needs. Some of that is obtainable only on free markets, where prices can far exceed state-set levels. County official <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said someday <PERSON> Fengyang </PERSON> will follow the example of prospering coastal areas, where farms are being turned over to talented farmers while surplus farm population is shifted to jobs in construction and light industry. <PERSON> Fengyang </PERSON> also needs to have more mechanized farming, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said, while stressing that the family farm should be retained. `` We're still exploring,'' he said.

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s decision to cut the price on its crude oil exports for the first half of July has raised prospects of a possible price war, depressing oil futures prices to their lowest levels of the year. The contract for August delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, dropped 27 cents Thursday to $ 15.16 per barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. It was the lowest level for WTI since Dec. 21, 1987, when the near-term contract also finished at $ 15.16. Among refined products traded on the exchange, the July contract for home heating oil slipped 0.64 cent to 40.88 cents a gallon. The July contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 51.94 cents, down 0.68 cent from the previous strong session, when prices soared on speculation that demand would grow as the July 4th holiday neared. Traders attributed Thursday's decline largely to profit-taking. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a senior analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s announcement made traders even more bearish about the outlook for oil prices than they had been in recent weeks Traders have been worried about overproduction by oil nations, who have created a glut that has been depressing prices. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s senior oil ministry official, <PERSON> Hammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON>, said his country would reduce its oil export prices by up to $ 1.85 a barrel for the first half of July. <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> declined to comment further. But in a later interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, he blamed the deterioration in world oil prices on some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries that are exceeding the production quotas agreed to by all but one of the cartel's 13 members. <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said the action by <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which is not a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, could prompt some <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries to increase their production to remain competitive. `` The -LRB- oil futures -RRB- market is nervous about what <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> might do'' if other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members cheated further on their quotas, <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ayoub </PERSON> did not mention any <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries by name, but said that all countries should remain committed to their quotas and `` stay away from unclear selling tactics.''

 Italians are riding the range in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. West Germans are inspecting plantations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. And Japanese are teeing up wherever they find a nice golf course. Heading into the Independence Day weekend, tourism officials were predicting the lure of the cheaper dollar would help bring a record 30.2 million foreign visitors to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year. The expected increase is modest, up less than 2 percent from 29.7 million last year. And not all of the visitors are tourists. Many come for business, as students, or to visit friends and relatives. But the financial power of foreign visitors _ they are expected to spend a record $ 22.1 billion here this year _ is reshaping the hospitality business. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is on sale,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toohey </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, told foreign tour operators last month in a gathering held in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in May. Americans are learning to provide the amenities they get when they travel abroad. Multilingual signs are popping up. Some big-city hotels now have same-day delivery of Japanese newspapers. Tourism professionals also say they have to cater to the particular tastes of specific nationalities. It turns out many West Germans have a fascination with the pre-Civil War South, while Europeans of all kinds feel they have n't seen <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> without a pony ride way out <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> `` I have 82 Italians here right now,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cote </PERSON>, the owner and camp cook of the <ORGANIZATION> Tanque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said Thursday. `` Cowboys and Indians are typically American, so that's a strong image for them.'' Although for some foreigners the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not become a major travel bargain _ it is not much cheaper for Canadians than it used to be and has become more expensive for Mexicans _ shifting exchange rates have doubled the power of currencies such as the Japanese yen and West German mark since early 1985. The 11.8 million Canadians who are expected to arrive this year vastly outnumber visitors from other countries, while Mexicans are second at 6.4 million, according to projections of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. But the border nations are getting less notice lately than the free-spending Japanese, who are in third place and rising rapidly. About 2.8 million Japanese are expected this year, up 30 percent from 1987, the fastest growth rate of any major country. The growth should continue under <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Ten Million Program, which seeks to double the annual number of Japanese tourists going abroad to 10 million by 1991. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has been a popular Japanese tourist spot, drawing about 1.2 million Japanese visitors. Tourism officials have tried to help by putting up many signs in Japanese _ perhaps too many. `` Some of them have come to me and said, ` We're going to visit in a foreign land; we ought to be able to fend for ourselves,''' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>, senior vice president for marketing at the <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` You're damned if you do and damned if you do n't.'' A step at a time, cautious Japanese tourists have ventured from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where shopping at <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and bus tours through <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> are popular. Around 1986, the Japanese began to discover <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. All <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, which began direct flights between <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that year, says an expansion to daily service has been held back only by a lack of pilots and planes. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a paradise of fairways and greens to the Japanese, some of whom do most of their golfing back home on multi-tiered driving ranges because it is so hard to get a tee time on crowded courses. Japanese visitors tend to stick to well-traveled routes, while Europeans are more willing to rent a car and discover <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But even the Europeans do n't spend a lot of vacation time in heartland states such as <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Farmers from more than 25 countries are expected to compete in the plowing match during the World Ag Expo at the Amana Colonies in September, but sightseers from abroad are fairly scarce in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Strittmatter </PERSON>, marketing manager for the state <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> capitalized on the popularity of the `` North and South'' television series about the Civil War, which was shown twice in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, by offering a free trip to the Palmetto State in a joint promotion with a German women's magazine, <PERSON> Das </PERSON> <PERSON> Neue </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatt </PERSON>. The states, locales and tourist attractions that are most successful in attracting foreign visitors are the ones who began their efforts before the dollar's big decline, said <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, for example, has representatives spread from <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. Disney World in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is famed for its marketing to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hogate </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant expects 60 percent of its customers will come from abroad this year, the culmination of marketing efforts that <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> has pushed for seven years. The French want window seats, the Japanese like ice cream and the Germans would rather have a Budweiser than a German beer, Hogate's discovered. The homework, and the sales calls to tour operators, paid off. `` When the tidal wave started to turn in our direction, we were on the receiving end,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, the sales director. `` Our name was on the tip of their tongues.''

<HEAD>Post-Crash Times Tough On Many Stock Market Newsletters</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New for PMs.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newsletter editor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> remembers better times for analyzing over-the-counter stocks. `` Last year this time, you could see it when we picked a stock,'' he said. `` It moved right away. Now, we pick a stock, it may not budge.'' Meet another group of the walking wounded from last October's stock market crash _ entrepreneurs who produce the nation's investment <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> and other small purveyors of stock-market advice are finding their readership has slipped almost as badly as the Dow Jones average over the past year. `` This will be the first year my business will not have grown,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nurock </PERSON>, publisher of the Astute Investor, based in nearby <LOCATION> Paoli </LOCATION>. `` Even given the fact that I missed calling the crash, the response to my advertising has been especially poor.'' <PERSON> Nurock </PERSON> said subscriptions to his Astute Investor have dropped by 28 percent since peaking in January 1987. Since the crash, individual investors, wary of the impact of program trading on the market and the prospect of another collapse, largely have abandoned stocks. The market for advice, good or otherwise, is off sharply. Even before October, dark clouds were gathering for the newsletters. The emergence of mutual funds as major investment vehicles reduced the need to choose individual stocks. At the same time, the five-year bull market created a proliferation of investment advice in newspapers and magazines and on television. `` Suddenly, we had all this competition,'' said <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, 36, a former newspaper reporter. `` We were like the race tracks when casino gambling came along.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON>, a widely known market pundit and editor of two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> newsletters, agreed. `` It used to be when you were right, business was good,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now you never know. Basically, the business has n't been healthy for a couple of years now.'' Newsletter issuers range from <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to individuals armed with little more than a home computer and their hunches. Some publications have thrived in the post-crash environment. <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> said the subscription base of his <ORGANIZATION> Zweig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> has increased by 4,000, to 14,000, since late November. Overall revenue is running 80 percent ahead of last year, he said. A one-year subscription to <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON>'s newsletter, published every three weeks, costs $ 245. <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON>, a former finance professor and a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, attributes his circulation surge to performance. According to a rating of investment newsletters by <ORGANIZATION> Hulbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> <PERSON> Forecast </PERSON> was the second-best performer in the five-year period that ended March 31, posting an 18.9 percent annual return on a portfolio of selected stocks. `` We basically called the crash,'' <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> said. `` On Oct. 19, we were only 8 percent invested in stocks.'' Similarly, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> InvesTech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analyst </ORGANIZATION>, a newsletter published out of <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, said he began recommending that his clients get out of the market in April 1987. By early October, he was out of the market. `` Our subscription rate is up 28 percent over the past eight months,'' said Stack, a former <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> engineer who began his newsletter six years ago. Stack noted he did not escape the year unscathed: clients who heeded his advice to abandon the market in April found themselves sitting on the sidelines during last summer's run-up. `` We were getting out while the bull market was still going strong,'' he said. `` We had a 2.5 percent cancellation rate in August, which is phenomenally high for us. It was very depressing.'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, a Philadelphian who edits the New York-based publication OTC Review Special Situations, said circulation peaked at 5,000 subscriptions in the spring of 1987. Since then, subscriptions to the monthly newsletter, priced at $ 150 annually, have dropped by half despite a relatively robust recovery by over-the-counter stocks. The owner of the newsletter, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> to edit it at home and contracted circulation services to an outside firm. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said his April 1 move into a second-floor bedroom was not a response to the crash, but he acknowledged that industry cost-cutting is in vogue. `` A lot of newsletters are running close to the bone now,'' he said. `` So far, I have n't suffered any real personal damage, but there's no doubt we are in for some lean times.''

<HEAD>Former Bank Officers Enter Guilty Pleas In Continental Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former officer of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and a former <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> banker will seek probation after pleading guilty to charges related to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s historic near-collapse, a lawyer says. But prosecutors plan to seek prison terms for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, who admitted misapplying bank funds, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, who admitted helping <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> with the scheme. Both entered into a plea agreement Thursday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON>, nearly two months after a trial of the pair ended in a mistrial. `` It definitely closes the chapter on the Continental Bank-Penn Square relationship,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> after <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> accepted the defendants' guilty pleas and set sentencing for Aug. 30. Each man could get 5 years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine, but <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s attorney said the defendants would seek probation. `` We are looking forward to getting all this behind Mr. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> after a long, long road,'' said attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Streicker </PERSON>. Penn Square failed in 1982, and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> came close to collapse two years later after the largest run on deposits in banking history, following disclosure that it held millions in poor energy-related loans. The government kept <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s doors open with a record $ 4.5 billion bailout. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, 53, a former vice president who once headed <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s oil and gas lending operation in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, said: `` I feel we've come to an agreement that's fair to everyone <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON> had no comment. His client, who once had assets valued at $ 2 million, left the courtroom in tears. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> were indicted on charges of wire fraud and misapplication of bank funds, and went to trial in March. But after seven weeks, the proceeding ended May 3 when the jury became deadlocked and <PERSON> Shadur </PERSON> declared a mistrial. A new trial on eight counts each of wire fraud and three counts each of misapplication of bank funds was scheduled to begin in September. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> was accused of buying millions of dollars in poor-quality loans from <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in return for kickbacks from <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 38, former head of energy lending at <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, was accused of arranging the kickbacks in the form of $ 585,000 worth of unsecured personal loans to <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> between 1980 and 1982. The jury in the first trial cleared a third defendant, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> drilling contractor <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON>, of wire fraud charges for his alleged role in a scheme to defraud <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> was accused of manipulating <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sturgis </PERSON> in schemes to save his own failing bank. The government said <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> was caught in spiraling personal debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle and accepted kickbacks from <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> in exchange for taking risky energy loans off <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>'s hands at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s expense. The indictment cited <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s involvement in $ 44 million in loans made by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to 12 Penn Square customers. It did not say how much was recovered by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> bank. In Thursday's guilty plea, <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> admitted arranging for <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to buy a $ 2.25 million loan made by <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> to one of its customers to cover a bad business deal of his partner, who was already millions of dollars in debt to <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Drought At A Glance</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Here is summary of recent developments in the drought gripping most of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Southeast.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>RAIN
   Heavy rain muddied parts of the Plains Thursday and today,
bringing relief to farmers but causing some flooding in Kansas.
   Some fields in northeastern Kansas, plus roads and bridges, were
under up to 5 feet of water Thursday. The heaviest rain reported
was 12 inches in Douglas County, Okla.
   </HEAD>
<HEAD>BEEF PRICES
   Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm Bureau, said beef
prices should be dropping as a result of the drought. He made the
comments to about 300 representatives of farm organizations, food
processors and retailers attended a three-day conference in St.
Louis on agricultural competitiveness and quality sponsored by the
Department of Agriculture.
   Cattle are being sold in droves because of poor pasture
conditions, he said.

<HEAD>WHEAT RESERVES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A federal analyst told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> that drought will cut the nation's wheat reserves by as much as half by next June 1. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> told the growers meeting at <LOCATION> Steamboat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, on Wednesday that the drought could drop the current inventory of 1.2 billion bushels down to 600 million or 700 million bushels by next June. That would be the lowest wheat inventory since three years of sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the early 1970s diminished the stockpile to 350 million bushels, he said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputer manufacturers said Friday they were disappointed with the Japanese government's failure to purchase U.S.-made supercomputers despite <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s commitment last year to encourage such procurements. A bilateral agreement to promote, though not guarantee, Japanese public-sector purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputers went into effect last August after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> complained that the Japanese government was favoring Japanese supercomputers over their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts. `` I think disappointed is the word'' to describe <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer makers' feeling toward Japanese government procurement of American supercomputers, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Supercomputers are advanced-technology computers that perform complex calculations at rapid speed and are used in such fields as science, engineering and the military. <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON> said the first three government procurements in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since the agreement went into effect, by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION> and Hokkaido universities and the High Energy Physics Laboratory, went to <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION>, which along with <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s leading computer makers. `` It's curious to us as we look at the data to see that -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms -RRB- have 80-85 percent of the supercomputer market in the rest of the world, but a relatively small share of the private sector in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and until recently had no installations in the Japanese government,'' <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON> headed a delegation of six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputer manufacturers which conducted a trade seminar and exhibition in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> this week. The delegation consisted of <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Sutherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Myrias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The solutions -LRB- to performance problems -RRB- that these firms bring to the market are an attractive package for Japanese users,'' <PERSON> McPhee </PERSON> said. The delegation came to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to familiarize potential Japanese clients with their technology and to study possible joint marketing of their products with Japanese partners, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, Prime Computer's senior manager for engineering and scientific sales support. `` We're having tremendous interest with prospects for accounts,'' <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said. `` My experience on this mission with prospects we've talked to and the excitement and interest of our subsidiary in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for the mini-supercomputer market has been very good, and we expect some major sales in the Japanese market.''

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Continues To Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Strong economic growth cut the broadest measure of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus by 19 percent in May from a year earlier and pushed down the jobless rate to a three-year low of 2.5 percent, the government said Friday. The surplus in the current account, the broadest measure of a nation's commerce, including trade in goods and services as well as capital transfers, fell to $ 5.79 billion from $ 7.12 billion in April and $ 7.11 billion in May 1987, the ministry said. May was the second month in a row that the surplus declined from both previous-month and year-earlier levels. During the first three months of the year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy grew at an annual rate of 11.3 percent, its highest level in 11 years. The expansion of the economy fueled heavy demand for imports, including steel, lumber and non-ferrous metals, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. Exports were led by such products as computers and semiconductors. Unemployment in May fell 0.1 percentage point from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted 2.5 percent, the Management and <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The May rate represented a sharp turnaround from the record high of 3.2 percent registered in the same month a year earlier. The number of job holders hit a record 61 million, up 2.2 percent from 59.8 million a year earlier. The official said the number of jobs increased in virtually all industrial sectors, with companies becoming increasingly eager to hire new workers to meet growing demand. The chief exception was agriculture, which registered a drop of 50,000 jobs during the month, the agency said. A 2.5 percent unemployment rate was last registered in April 1985. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate would be higher if calculated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European methods.

 The stock market inched ahead today, bidding to extend its early-summer rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .89 to 2,142.60 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 492 up, 455 down and 458 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 43.23 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. More than a third of that activity came in a few utility issues, which were involved in short-term trading strategies based on their quarterly dividend payments. Analysts said worries about inflation had been diminished in recent days by rainfall in the drought-plagued Farm Belt and declines in world oil prices.

<HEAD>Many Companies Confused About Toxic Release Reports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of companies may still be unaware of the need to meet today's deadline for reporting release of any one of 328 different toxic chemicals into the environment last year, says an industry representative. `` There's a tremendous amount of misunderstanding out there,'' said <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, dealing with the issue for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. The confusion arises because many businesses have assumed the law applies only to chemical companies, and no one has been able to mount a loud enough publicity campaign, she said. `` Throughout <ORGANIZATION> NAM </ORGANIZATION> in the past month, we've had about 1,000 calls inquiring whether a business is covered by the law, and I can count on the fingers of one hand those that were n't,'' she said Thursday. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> public relations firm chimed in today with evidence backing up her point: Interviews with representatives of 81 companies covered by the new law found only 24 had a program to answer questions at installations using the chemicals. `` Many companies in the food, transportation and instruments industries appear to be largely unprepared,'' said a statement from <ORGANIZATION> Ketchum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, part of <ORGANIZATION> Ketchum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The 1986 law requiring the reports was one response of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the disastrous leak in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, of methyl isocyanate in 1984 that killed almost 3,000 people. The law potentially applies to almost all manufacturers _ the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Classification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Codes </ORGANIZATION> 20 through 39 of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has certain discretion to expand it. The agency estimates that 30,000 installations probably should file five-page forms on an average of 10 different chemicals _ a total of 1.5 million pages. Not every company must report _ only those with 10 or more employees that manufacture, import or process 75,000 pounds per year of any of the chemicals, or use 10,000 pounds per year. These threshold quantities decline in future years. Companies that process a chemical make it an ingredient of a product, for an example. An example of use, on the other hand, is cleaning with a chemical. Affected companies must report all deliberate and accidental releases as well as leaks. If measurements or calculations are unavailable, `` engineering judgment'' may be used. Reports must be made to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and to state authorities. Environmentalists are counting on the accessibility of the data in computer form to generate political support for a broader and tighter program of regulation. `` I'll tell you what the public reaction is going to be: It's not going to like the fact that the environment is used as a dumping ground for all these chemicals,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheiman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cathcart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose trade group has sent emissaries from its own ranks and from members into hundreds of newspaper offices to explain what's coming, said, `` It would not be a good thing ... if people just drew conclusions from the numbers.'' The association has encouraged member companies to release forms publicly as they file them, and <PERSON> Cathcart </PERSON> said the group is telling people, `` You should talk to people you have confidence in'' if anything about the reports arouses concern. Some of the numbers are going to be huge: about 2.2 billion pounds of toluene, a common petrochemical, are released to the air nationwide each year. No one has a good idea of the total for all the covered chemicals, or the damage being done. The 328 chemicals were specified by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from lists used by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> programs. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says slightly more than half can cause cancer, at least in animals, and 44 percent are acutely toxic. Several years ago, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that airborne chemicals were causing 2,000 annual deaths from cancer.

 More than 10,000 submarine builders at the Electric Boat shipyard went on strike today after refusing to accept the company's offer of lump-sum bonuses instead of wage increases over the next three years. The Metal Trades Council, representing more than half of the shipyard's 18,000 workers, negotiated with the company until a half hour before the midnight deadline before announcing an impasse. No new talks were planned, union and company officials said early today. About 300 chanting pickets marched outside the gates of the giant yard under sunny skies this morning. City police reported two arrests, one of a man setting off fireworks and another of a man who allegedly drove his car through police barricades in front of the plant, nearly hitting some pickets. Company officials did n't know how many people stayed off the job today. Union officials said 5,000 blue-collar workers normally report for the first shift. The submarine workers voted 4,921-3 ,140 Thursday to reject the latest contract offer from <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Electric Boat is one of only two shipyards making nuclear submarines for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and the only manufacturer of giant subs capable of carrying the Trident ballistic Electric Boat General Manager <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON> said a strike will not stop submarine construction. The company made arrangements to reassign 3,000 of its 8,000 salaried employees to new jobs within the yard, he said. Electric Boat offered employees bonuses worth 5 percent of a worker's wages during the first contract year and 4 percent during the second and third years of the pact. The union demanded wage increases of 5 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent. The shipyard said it could not afford to raise base pay if it was to remain competitive in its pursuit of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contracts. `` We have maintained steadfastly that not increasing the base -LRB- pay -RRB- is what is going to close the competitive disadvantage we have with <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON>. Pickets went up one minute past midnight outside the shipyard's main gate, located along the <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that flows into eastern <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> `` No one likes to see a strike,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Messier </PERSON>. `` The company does n't like to see it, the union does n't like to see it, the community does n't like to see it, but it just comes down to you've just got to do what you've got to do.'' The last strike at the shipyard was in 1975, when the union walked out for five months and the region's economy sagged. Electric Boat's final offer, presented Monday, called for bonuses totaling $ 4,250 over three years for a first-class mechanic making $ 12.02 an hour, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotir </PERSON>, vice president of human resources. Earlier Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> awarded this year's third and final SSN-688 attack submarine contract to Electric Boat. The $ 347.4 million contract will go to <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>'s main shipyard here and its other plant, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, which is unaffected by the strike. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which pays its workers 60 cents an hour less than <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>, recently won two contracts for nuclear attack submarines after it underbid Electric Boat.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Higher</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Futures prices of grain and soybeans opened sharply higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts for a long, dry Independence Day weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, analysts said. Corn prices got an additional boost from indications that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Argentinian corn. Talk of Soviet purchases helped drive corn futures up their daily trading limit of 10 cents a bushel at the opening bell, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Early advances in the other trading pits were limited by profit-taking ahead of the long holiday weekend, he said. `` This is a nervous trading market and it will stay that way today unless someone changes their weather forecast at midday,'' <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. Thursday's monthly grain stocks report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which showed larger-than-expected stocks of corn, wheat and soybeans, also offset some of the bullish enthusiusm,, he said. In early trading, wheat was 9 cents to 14 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.98 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 15 cents higher with July, on which the daily price limit has been removed, at $ 3.42 a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 13 cents higher with July at $ 3.55 a bushel; soybeans were 10 -LCB- cents to 22 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 10.02 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were sharply lower, with pork futures down their daily limits, in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The sharp declines in pork futures were linked to Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> hogs and pigs report, which showed an unexpectedly large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hog herd, analysts said Live cattle were unchanged to .90 cent lower with August at 63.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .87 cent lower with August at 73.10 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower across the board with July at 44.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with July at 35.25 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 Big jumps in factory and office building boosted construction spending 1.1 percent in May, offsetting declines elsewhere, the government said today in a report that suggested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers are actively investing for the future. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 407.1 billion in May following a 0.2 percent dip in April. In March, construction shot up 2.8 percent. The department's report put factory construction at 22.8 percent above the same level last year, a reflection of strong growth in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s manufacturing industries because of increased demand, primarily higher exports. But the report also showed a 1 percent decline in residential construction in May, another indication that higher interest rates have hurt the housing industry by making mortgage loans unaffordable to many potential homebuyers. In other economic news early today, stocks retreated in pre-weekend profit taking after a broad gain Thursday but the bond market rose on the strength of the dollar. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's resilience came despite moves Thursday by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> to raise their interest rates, which would tend to weaken the dollar. The markets also ignored a $ 99 billion rise in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign debt for 1987, reported Tursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The increase to $ 368.2 billion underscored fears by many critics that the country is living beyond its means and is losing its worldwide political and economic might. `` As long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has to rely on foreign financing of such magnitudes, events could at literally any moment trigger a sharp turndown in our economy,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration contends that the leap in the nation's debt during its tenure largely reflects the investment attractions in this country, with foreigners pouring in money to buy real estate, factories and securities. The other big market news Thursday was in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s commodity pits, where soybean and grain speculators drove prices up sharply, ending a two-day decline caused by rainfall on the water-starved farm belt. The buying rush came after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued its latest 30-day outlook late Wednesday, calling for almost no rainfall in the critical areas. Elsewhere Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in May, reflecting a sharp drop in demand for aircraft that was offset by strength in other areas. It was the largest one-month decline since a 1.4 percent drop in August, but economists were n't concerned because orders had been up sharply in March and April. They said the May decline actually could be good for the economy by giving overworked factories an opportunity to catch up with unfilled orders.

 The stock market pulled back today in a flurry of pre-holiday weekend selling. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.86 to 2,135.85 by noontime on Wall Street. Losers held a 3-2 lead over gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 519 up, 750 down and 487 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 148.60 million shares at noontime, up from 137.92 million at the same point Thursday. More than a third of today's activity came in a few utility issues, which were involved in short-term trading strategies based on their quarterly dividend payments. Analysts said worries about inflation had been diminished in recent days by rainfall in the drought-plagued Farm Belt and declines in world oil prices. The easing of inflationary expectations has sparked a rally of late in the bond market, pushing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds below 9 percent. However, brokers said traders appeared cautious about making large commitments today on the eve of the long July 4 weekend. The markets will be closed on Monday for the holiday. Losers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, down ~ at 52 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, down \ at 127 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, down ~ at 92; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 43 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 26 | National Semiconductor dropped \ to 12 -RCB- in active trading. The stock fell 1 -RRB- Thursday on disappointment over the size of the quarterly earnings gain posted by the company. Today National said it would buy back 4.1 million of its common shares and 4.1 warrants to buy its stock from <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell .46 to 154.01.

<HEAD>Dollar Coin Will Replace Paper Bill By Mid-1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s one-dollar coin, nicknamed the Loonie because one side depicts a swimming loon, will entirely replace the paper dollar bill within two years, the government has announced. The Loonie was introduced last year under a plan to save taxpayers 175 million Canadian dollars, or about $ 145 million, over 20 years because coins have a longer circulation life than paper bills. But public acceptance of the gold-colored, 11-sided coin has been limited and most banks and stores still provide customers with dollar bills. Many Canadians have hoarded Loonies, believing the coin will share the demise of the <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> dollar coin introduced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1979 and overwhelmingly rejected. But the federal government, acting upon recommendations of the Royal Canadian Mint and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, says production of dollar bills will cease on June 30, 1989, and the bills will cease to be legal tender about one year later, the normal life span of a paper dollar.

 Seven babies are born every second in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the continent may be only days away from reaching 3 billion inhabitants, an occasion causing some concern in the world's most crowded corner, experts said Friday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, faced with a motherlode of maternity, marked the occasion with a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keep practicing birth control. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a group of experts gathered to debate the significance of the approaching milestone, its effects on the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people. <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s minister of agriculture, said `` excessive population growth will result in shortages of food, resources and energy ... and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries. `` Without global-level responses to the issues of population, food, environment and development, it would be difficult for the world to welcome a peaceful 21st century,'' said <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, chairman of the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development, which sponsored the conference. In July 1987, the world's population passed 5 billion, double the population in 1950. According to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> estimates, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s population will reach 3 billion at 47 minutes after midnight <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Time </LOCATION> on Aug. 10 -LRB- 8:47 p.m. EDT Aug. 9 -RRB-. Asian experts, however, predict the milestone will be reached within days. Professor <PERSON> Gayl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> estimated that <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s population would grow to 3.5 billion by the end of the century and to 4.5 billion by 2025, while the world population reaches 8.2 billion. Rice production will have to increase 50 percent by 2025 to feed the continent, <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> said, but great gains already have been registered by farmers in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The 21st century targets `` are well within the realm of possibility if the agricultural transformation continues. This, of course, requires sensitive government policies,'' said the sociologist and researcher on <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> population. <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> has made `` substantial progress'' in lowering fertility rates, and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries were the first to adopt policies to limit population growth, he said. But <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> noted disparities in different regions of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. East Asian countries such as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which has 122 million people, have rapidly declining fertility rates. But in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is still experiencing 2.08 percent annual growth in its population of 818 million; <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has 3.45 percent growth with 115 million people; and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has 2.67 percent growth rate from a current base of 110 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. `` The challenge lies ahead in completing the demographic transition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in the death rates,'' <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> said. He and other panelists were critical of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for withdrawing money from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Fund for Population Activities because of the fund's support for abortion. The population growth also has caused some social changes. Professor <PERSON> Toshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuroda </PERSON>, director emeritus of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Nihon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, noted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` expects the family to care for the aged ... but the family is undergoing tremendous change in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with the one-child family.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the world's most populous country with 1.08 billion people, has since the early 1980s limited most families to one child. But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, Chinese officials marked the Day of 3 Billion In <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> with a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People. They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers, doctors and others for `` outstanding performance in implementing our population policy.'' Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to economic development. `` We can not think that we can have more children because of economic development ... nor can we relax our efforts because of progress in family planning,'' said <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Keshi </PERSON>, forum vice chairman.

 Polluters should be punished for allowing rampant industrial waste to push the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to the brink of an ecological disaster, the head of the country's new environmental protection committee said Friday. <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON>, chief of the committee that was created in January, told a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference that `` the grave ecological situation has emerged because of the ill-considered drive to build gigantic plants.'' <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON> said the natural fertility of soils is declining, topsoil is decreasing and forests are `` in an unsatisfactory condition.'' The air in all industrial centers is polluted `` above the hygienic standards'' and `` the quality of water in the rivers worsens nearly everywhere,'' he said. He said the Caspian and Baltic seas are polluted and called the <LOCATION> Aral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> `` a disaster zone.'' `` Behind the facts of outrages upon nature and damage done to human health are certain people in science, design institutions and builders, members of state commissions, with whose blessing facilities were put into operation which destroy nature,'' <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON> said. `` Those who are responsible for the problems should be mentioned by name and be punished according to their deserts,'' he added. <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON> addressed the 5,000 delegates at the conference a day after a steelworker from the Urals city of <PERSON> Nizhny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagil </PERSON> criticized government leaders for their failure to tackle problems he said had reached the proportions of `` a Chernobyl-like catastrophe.'' Steelworker <PERSON> Veniamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarin </PERSON> lent force to his appeal by depicting the situation in his city, where 10,000 people demonstrated earlier this year against failure to close two 45-year-old coke-fired furnaces at the city's steel mill. One Soviet media report said 54 children were stillborn in the city last year. <PERSON> Nizhny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tagil </PERSON> has a population of 403,000. <PERSON> Yarin </PERSON> said the government should devise an emergency program for up to 60 Soviet cities he said were polluted beyond all norms. The environment has become an issue of great concern to many Soviets as <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness, has revealed the extent of ecological damage in candid media articles. The <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region is in particularly bad shape. The area was heavily industrialized during World War II as the Soviets moved their factories eastward, away from the invading <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said in December that another Urals industrial city, <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION>, was unfit for human habitation. Environmental damage is also a sensitive issue in the Baltic republics, whose delegations each mentioned the need to tackle what the Estonians term an ecological `` catastrophe'' in written platforms submitted to delegates. The Communist Party chief of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> referred Thursday to the catastrophic drop in the level of the <LOCATION> Aral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, a vast inland sea seriously depleted by schemes to irrigate the arid republics of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. A newspaper account in 1983 said excessive tapping of the sea for irrigation had halved its depth in a decade and caused the shoreline to recede 40 miles in a few years. <PERSON> Morgun </PERSON> is head of a committee established in January to deal with the mounting environmental problems. He said measures have been outlined to improve the situation, but did not immediately give any details.

<HEAD>ZIP Code Turns 25</HEAD>

 After a quarter century on the job, the ZIP code _ like most of us _ has gained a little weight. But it still helps smooth the flow of nearly half the world's mail. Friday marked the 25th anniversary of that string of numbers bringing up the rear of every American address, a system ordered into use by by then-Postmaster General <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, who says he simply got tired of waiting for bureaucrats to finish studying the idea. Day's original five-digit system held sway for 20 years and is still the most commonly seen. An expanded version was introduced in 1983, though, adding four more numbers to bring the total to nine _ a voluntary addition officially called `` ZIP Plus 4'' but referred to in postal circles as `` Son of ZIP.'' The basic system, says senior assistant postmaster general <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, has been a `` roaring success.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with only about 6 percent of the world's population, has 50 percent of the world's mail volume, <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> points out By way of comparison, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan area handles about the same volume of mail as all of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area's mail is about equal to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s, said Day, who now is retired from government service and is living in a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In the 25 years since the introduction of ZIP _ which stands for <ORGANIZATION> Zone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail volume has more than doubled, but the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employs only about 15 percent more people, <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said. And the ZIP system is a big factor in that labor saving. `` No direct calculation of the exact savings has been made,'' <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's hard to separate the effect of the ZIP code from other things. But believe me, I think it's up there in the several billions of dollars.'' In 1963 the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> carried 67.9 billion pieces of mail, sorted by human beings at a maximum rate of 800 items an hour. Now reconstituted as the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the agency handled 153.9 billion pieces last year. With ZIP codes the mail can be sorted by machines at a rate of 27,000 to 35,000 pieces an hour. Public acceptance has been `` amazing,'' said <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>, with ZIP codes on about 97 percent of the items mailed. Even better, he added, 95 percent of mail comes in with correct ZIP codes. A variety of coding systems had been under study when Day lost patience. What he did was simply to announce, during a speech in December 1962, that a new coding system would take effect the following July 1. It worked. Years of study ended and within six months the agency decided on a five-digit system, divided the nation into regions and assigned a code to each of the more than 30,000 post offices in the country. The system took effect July 1, 1963, accompanied by promotional hoopla organized by the Post Office and grumbling by people afraid they would lose their identities to some anonymous numbers. The ZIP code divided the nation into 10 slices, each starting with a different number, from `` 0'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to `` 9'' on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The next two numbers designate a major city in the area, for example 606 is <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Finally, the last two numbers localize the address to a neighborhood post office. And the four newly added digits in the code narrow the delivery down to one side of a city block or even one floor of a large office building in a major city.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on Friday canceled a contract calling for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to sell its popular <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle service to another <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. Eastern gave no explanation for the `` mutual'' cancellation in a terse news release and said no other details would be forthcoming. `` This is one of those releases where we ca n't make any comment beyond the text. The release will have to speak for itself,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which battled the proposed sale in court, and for Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately return telephone calls. The sale of the profitable <LOCATION> Washington-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-Boston </LOCATION> shuttle routes to the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary would have brought the financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> $ 225 million, company officials have said. In March, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, ruling on a suit filed by the Machinists, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, by taking steps to sell the shuttle, had flouted a July 1987 order that barred it from transferring 6,000 ground crew members to the other <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. But on June 7, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lifted that injunction. The appeals court said <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> had erred in holding Eastern in contempt for taking the steps. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, which represents about 13,000 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers, has long contended that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> aims to break up the carrier it bought in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union and Eastern are holding secret contract talks guided by federal mediators. The union has rejected deep pay and benefit cuts the company calls necessary to return to profitability. Eastern has lost a total of nearly $ 1 billion in the past 10 years.

 Share prices rose fractionally Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market plodded along in the absence of any market-affecting news. The start of the weekend and Monday's Independence Day holiday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> kept many participants sidelined. In addition, some players were taking a wait-and-see attitude amid speculation that British interest rates could rise over the next week. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 0.6 point, or 0.03 percent, higher at 1,858.2. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 6.22 points at 2,135.49 as the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session drew to a close, after opening about 3 points higher. Dealers said Wall Street was not providing a substantial influence on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> share prces. Fears of another increase in British interest rates, following Tuesday's half-percentage-point rise to 9.5 percent in bank's base lending rates, were triggered by renewed strength in the dollar, dealers said.

<HEAD>China Sets Up Largest Airline in Reorganization of Flag Carrier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest airline, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, was established Friday under a plan to revamp the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the state-run flag carrier that has been criticized for mismanagement and inefficiency. The government announced more than a year ago plans to bring competition into civil aviation and separate <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION>'s government functions from its business management by creating six airline companies. `` The establishment of Air <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is an important achievement for <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> in implementing the civil aviation system reform plan,'' <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yizhou </PERSON>, director general of <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> told a reception at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Great Hall of the People Vice Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON> and representatives of major international airlines that fly to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> attended the reception. A large red-and-white banner across the stage bore the words `` Air China'' and the airline's logo, a red phoenix. Attendents were dressed in the airline's new uniforms, designed by <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>. The sophisticated two-piece wool outfits and peaked cap, all in vibrant blue, contrast sharply with the ill-fitting, blue-gray pantsuits worn by <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> stewardesses. Air <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be the nation's major international carrier, operating 32 overseas routes to 31 cities in 24 countries. It also will operate 44 domestic routes to 30 cities. The airline, with a fleet of 46 planes and a staff of nearly 1,000, is the third and largest to be established under <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION>'s decentralization plans <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, and the Chengdu-based <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> were formed earlier this year under the decentralization plan. <ORGANIZATION> CAAC </ORGANIZATION> now has a strictly administrative role and will no longer manage airline business. The airlines operate as enterprises responsible for their own profits and losses.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has offered settlements of less than $ 1 million to each of the families of 24 children killed in a fiery church bus crash, The <ORGANIZATION> Courier-Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday. Citing unidentified lawyers close to the case, the newspaper also reported that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactured the chassis of the bus involved in the accident, offered payments to the estates of the three adults who died and to the 40 survivors of the May 14 crash, based on the severity of their injuries. Lawyer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Skeeters </PERSON>, a spokesman for the firm that represents many of the families, would neither confirm nor deny the report. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hance </PERSON>, who represents the families of two of the dead children, said the settlement was being offered by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and all manufacturers responsible for producing the bus, including <ORGANIZATION> Sheller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which assembled it. <PERSON> Hance </PERSON> declined to disclose the size of the offers, but described them as `` attractive financially'' to the families and also a good deal for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, Mich.-based <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, said `` delicate'' negotiations were under way but declined comment on whether a settlement had been offered. <ORGANIZATION> Sheller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman did not return phone calls. The wreck occurred as the converted school bus, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was returning 67 people to the church after a day at an amusement park. Police say the accident was caused by a drunken driver traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71. But investigators have said other factors combined to increase the loss of life, including the bus' lone rear exit door and crowded conditions inside. Authorities have also pointed to the bus' gas tank, which ruptured in the crash and burst into flames, with the smoke from the resulting fire blamed for all 27 deaths. The bus was apparently one of the last manufactured in 1977 before a new federal rule required bus fuel tanks be sheathed in protective cages. Prominent mass-disaster lawyers said it would be highly unusual for such a major case to be settled even before lawsuits were filed. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coale </PERSON>, who represents one family and has been active in several air-disaster cases, said it would be `` unconscionable'' to settle so quickly without exploring whether <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> might be liable for punitive damages.

 <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemoin </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with a bag full of dreams and a fist full of dollars. The French woman is part of the wave of foreigners taking advantage of the weak dollar to visit <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and splurge on goods that have become bargains in terms of their own currencies. Ms. <PERSON> Lemoin </PERSON>, 21, arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this year carrying a suitcase, a satchel stuffed with guidebooks and slick tourist brochures and a wad of travelers' checks and assorted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. She said she never expected her money to go so far. But <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, stopped in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> en route to a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> vacation, expecting to pick up a lot of bargains. `` We're taking his wallet to my favorite places _ <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, anticipating her shopping spree at two of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s most stylish department stores. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> took their vacation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the same reason. They estimated their week-long trip would cost about half what they would have paid two years ago. They may have been carried away in their enthusiasm, since the dollar is only 10 percent cheaper against the pound than it was at the end of June 1986. `` Everything is so warm, so new, so cheap,'' he said. `` And you have <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' his wife added, referring to the star of popular television detective series `` Miami Vice.'' Foreigners have been lining up to get into the Empire State Building, to catch a ride on the <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> ferry past the Statue of Liberty, and to buy half-price tickets for Broadway shows. They have been packing restaurants in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, record crowds are converging on the beaches, popular tourist attractions in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. And the numbers are expected to swell during the summer. The rise in foreign tourism is due largely to the weak dollar, which has doubled the buying power of the Japanese yen and West German mark since early 1985. Most other nations' currencies also buy more here. By the end of the year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> predicts a record 30.2 million foreigners will have visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as tourists, on business, or on visits to friends and relatives. `` I'm hearing French, German and Japanese everywhere. It's like a language school outside my office,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 1.4 million-acre <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where attendance is up more than 40 percent over last year. Nearly half of the foreign visitors will come from neighboring <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the tourism administration said. But more Japanese and Europeans are expected to visit than ever before. `` Projections are that British, German, and French travel to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will hit a new record, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will hit a new record again,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdmann </PERSON> of the agency's research office. The number of visiting Brazilians also is expected to increase, in part due to that government's decision to rescind the 25 percent surtax on overseas plane tickets and on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars purchased for foreign travel. Executives at the Resort Hotel Association of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, said they thought they were overly optimistic when they sent their <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tourism office 20,000 brochures touting package deals to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> beach resort. `` We were gambling. But in 10 days, we ran out,'' said <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, executive director of the association. `` The requests coming in are phenomenal. We never expected it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lemoin </PERSON>, who left <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> a year ago to study languages in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said at first she did not think she could afford a trip to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Her home is in <LOCATION> Toulouse </LOCATION>. `` My aunt always told me the first place I should visit was ` the States,''' she said. `` But I thought it would be too expensive.'' It only took an outing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> areas to dispel that notion. `` I've been able to buy whatever I want,'' she said, looking out into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> from the top of the 110-story World Trade Center. `` I hope to have a lot more of these before I go home,'' she said, pointing to a huge bag stuffed with a variety of souvenirs, including T-shirts, postcards, coffee mugs and an apple-shaped key ring emblazoned with `` I Love <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' And that was just the beginning, she said. She pulled out a color pamphlet from the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> tourist ageny and said: `` I'm disappointed the only place I wo n't get to see is the Grand Canyon.''

 Corn futures prices closed sharply higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, with most contracts up the limit for daily trading on a combination of drought fears and rumors of Soviet purchases. Forecasts for a warm, dry Independence Day weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> also supported wheat and soybean futures, but oat prices dropped sharply on indications that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> millers were importing oats from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, analysts said. `` Corn was very strong and rumors of Russian buying were rampant,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the Soviets were believed to have purchased 500,000 to 1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and an unknown amount of Argentine corn. Most corn contracts advanced the 10-cents-a-bushel limit and the limitless contract for July delivery soared even higher. Gains in the wheat and soybean trading pits, while substantial, were held down by Thursday's monthly grain stocks report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which showed larger-than-expected stocks of corn, wheat and soybeans, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. At the close, wheat was 10 cents to 17 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 4.01 a bushel; corn was 9 -LCB- cents to 14 cents higher with July at $ 3.41 a bushel; oats were 21 cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $ 3.32 a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 28 cents higher with July at $ 9.90 a bushel.

 The stock market turned downward today in a flurry of pre-holiday weekend selling. Close to half of the day's activity came in a few utility issues, which were involved in short-term trading strategies based on their quarterly dividend payments. Analysts said worries about inflation had been diminished in recent days by rainfall in the drought-plagued Farm Belt and declines in oil prices to their lowest level of the year. The easing of inflationary expectations has sparked a rally of late in the bond market, pushing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds below 9 percent. However, brokers said traders appeared cautious about making large commitments today on the eve of the long July 4 weekend. The markets will be closed on Monday for the holiday.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is shutting all its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for a two-week summer vacation beginning Saturday, allowing the No. 2 automaker to set up the plants to build 1989 models, the company said Friday. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest automaker, was still organizing its summer vacation and model changeover schedules, which will be scattered through July and August. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has used a nationwide July vacation shutdown for model changeovers for the past several years, eliminating the need for temporary layoffs, spokeswoman <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhlberg </PERSON> said. `` It's very efficient. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> shuts down a month in August,'' she said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, however, workers will have to make up the lost production time with overtime later in the year because of surging car and truck sales, which have left <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> with low inventories. During the shutdown, some skilled workers at every plant will have to stay in the factories, installing new tooling and equipment for next year's models, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a temporary shutdown of its Fiero plant in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> next week and a two-week model changeover at its <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant beginning July 15. The Fiero plant will end production of the sporty, plastic-bodied two-seater later this summer at the end of the 1988 model run. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s heavy-duty truck assembly line in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> also will close temporarily starting July 15 and its medium-duty truck assembly line closes from Aug. 5-8. But demand for light-duty trucks is so high that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> assembly plant will continue production through the Aug. 4 changeover to 1989 models, as will the Pontiac West plant during an Aug. 12 changeover. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reports its model changeover shutdowns a week ahead of time. The only plant closed is <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, which shut for 16 weeks beginning June 17 for modernization and retooling. The plant, which built the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aries </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reliant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K-cars </ORGANIZATION>, will build the new <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acclaim </ORGANIZATION> sedans.

 The billionaire <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> brothers, who settled a $ 714 million debt for <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, are on the verge of settling a sister company's $ 704 million debt with 18 of the world's largest banks, a <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> vice president said. The $ 704 million debt is against <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is being reorganized under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. The proposed <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> settlement filed Thursday with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON> would resolve all issues surrounding some $ 760 million in loans to <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION>, while bringing the Hunt family trusts that run <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The proposal must be approved by the bankruptcy court. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said, the reorganization plan for Placid is `` just around the corner. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>, the world's biggest independent offshore oil-drilling company, and <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> sued 23 of their lenders for fraud and misrepresentation in 1986 after defaulting on $ 1.5 billion in bank loans. Two of the banks since have been dropped from the case. The suit sought $ 14 million in damages, alleging that the banks _ one group of which had sued to recover $ 760 million in past due loans to <LOCATION> Penrod </LOCATION> _ conspired to drive <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> and Placid out of business by forcing them to agree to an unreasonable payment schedule while offering their competitors more favorable terms. In August 1986, the trust estates of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the trust partnership that owns <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> itself was not under bankruptcy court protection. Under the consensual proposal filed Thursday, bank creditors would receive a $ 50 million payment and a $ 500 million secured note from <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION>, plus a 50 percent interest in the company, which is subject to repurchase by the trust estates. Some trust real estate will be transferred to the banks, subject to a $ 200 million purchase option. The trust estates would be released from prior liability to their bank creditors when the reorganization is complete. Also, the banks, trust estates and individual members of the <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> family would drop claims and counter-claims stemming from the bank loans. The proposed settlement has been approved by the group of banks led by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A Hunt estates statement said, `` When approved by the court, this plan by the trust estates and their bank creditors settles all issues surrounding the bank loans to <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'' There had been speculation that any settlement might require <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, manager for the <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> partners, to relinquish his power in <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON>'s daily operations However, <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said the agreement would not affect <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s position or the day-to-day operations of <LOCATION> Penrod </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said there was no timetable to the repayment plan. He also said there should be no problems gaining bankruptcy court approval of the plan because both sides of the dispute have agreed to it. <PERSON> Penrod </PERSON> employs about 2,300 workers and will have revenue of more than $ 250 million this year, <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has enough funds to carry on business through next Thursday only, could file for protection from its creditors next week, company chairman <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> would not confirm that his struggling company would indeed file for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, but he said in a telephone interview that if anything is to happen, it would be next week. `` There really is nothing happening today,'' <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, recuperating at home from open-heart surgery, said 12 foreign and domestic lenders, whom <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> owes $ 103 million, agreed to provide money to the company through next Thursday. On Thursday, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> toy company gave up on its plan to restructure its debts after having repeatedly extended a deadline for a securities swap by its bondholders. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has tried to restructure its finances since March, when it proposed exchanging $ 335 million of bonds for a combination of new bonds and stock. The company said the exchange would save it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash for the business. The original exchange terms were rejected by some of the bondholders, who contended the swap would have reduced the value of their investment without requiring similar sacrifices from <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s stockholders and bankers `` Unless they can pull a takeover of the company in the next few days, this sounds like the end,'' said <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Balis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> had not received any offers to buy the company and was not approached by any prospective buyers. He said other banks are willing to lend <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> money if it can work out arrangements with existing lenders. The company's current banks have provided short-term financing to keep <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> afloat since June 1. But the shortage of money forced the company to virtually halt production. If it survives, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> will have few products for store shelves at Christmas, the crucial season for toy manufacturers. The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids and Scrabble board games. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 47.4 million in the quarter that ended April 2. It has lost money in four of the past five years, including $ 215 million the last two years.

 The stock market pulled back Friday in a flurry of pre-holiday-weekend selling.

 Bond prices rose modestly Friday, supported by a strong dollar, fresh foreign demand and lower oil prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year issue rose about $ 1.50 per $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is a possible signal of other interest rate trends, declined to 8.83 percent from 8.85 percent late Thursday. Analysts noted that there was strong foreign demand for bonds despite the upcoming long Independence Day weekend. Most traders closed up shop at 3 p.m. EDT to get a jump on the three-day weekend. `` That demand, I would suspect, is being spurred by the strength of the dollar,'' noted <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Held </ORGANIZATION>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A stronger dollar attracts foreign capital and boosts bond prices, while a weaker dollar discourages foreigners from investing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, incites higher inflation and erodes bond prices Lower oil prices also supported bond prices by removing the specter of inflation, at least for the moment. The near-term contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled below $ 15 a barrel, its lowest level in nearly two years. Bond traders `` may be looking a little more at the -LRB- oil -RRB- markets,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of money-market research at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They have tended to ignore energy-related developments this year because thoughts were dominated by the dollar, but oil's downturn was so dramatic that it takes on a little more importance to the interest rate market,'' he said A <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that construction spending rose 1.1 percent in May had little effect on trading. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues rose 1-32 point to 1-16 point, intermediate maturities rose 5-32 point to 3-16 point, and long-term issues gained 3-16 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point equals a $ 10 change in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.08 to 110.33. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 1.49 to 1,154.65. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities also rose. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.92 to 285.95. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were unchanged at 6.55 percent. Six-month bills were off 2 basis points at 6.68 percent and year bills fell 4 basis points to 6.99 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

 The dollar rose further Friday, strengthened by pre-holiday buying and the lack of central bank intervention to dampen the momentum of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's recent advances. Gold prices rose slightly in late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading after steadying in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted gold at $ 437.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 435.10 at the same time Thursday. Money brokers said there was a widespread view in foreign-exchange markets that the dollar is heading higher for now because the key industrialized democracies will tolerate the move. But they said the advance will be slow and orderly, orchestrated through occasional dollar-selling by central banks. Traders at a major Japanese bank in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who spoke on the condition they not be identified, said they saw some significant orders for dollars Friday from large security companies, further bolstering the dollar's value. Some expressed short-term concern about possible intervention on Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market if the dollar rises too sharply. But others disagreed. `` I do n't think there's that much fear of intervention,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chorek </PERSON>, currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` If there was, you'd have seen it today.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar jumped 2.30 yen to close the week at 134.50 yen, its highest level since Nov. 27 when it closed at 134.75 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 134.05 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar was worth 134.43 yen, higher than its 133.04 yen-level late Thursday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound slid to its lowest point against the dollar this year, trading as low as $ 1.69. Late in the afternoon it was quoted at $ 1.7023, the lowest level since Oct. 27, and cheaper than $ 1.7085 Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.6960, cheaper than its $ 1.7115 level Thursday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday included: 1.8203 West German marks, up from 1.8155; 1.5135 Swiss francs, up from 1.5040; 1.2202 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2131; 6.1425 French francs, up from 6.1163; and 1,352.50 Italian lire, up from 1,344.75. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday: 1.8213 West German marks, up from 1.8170; 1.5130 Swiss francs, up from 1.5060; 6.1375 French francs, up from 6.1250; 2.0530 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,352.50 Italian lire, up from 1,350.38; 1.2190 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2126. Gold prices drifted in a narrow range Friday in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but rose mildly in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after a big midweek decline. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $ 1.90 a troy ounce to $ 437.20. Earlier in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 437.50 a troy ounce, unchanged from Thursday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> it rose, closing at $ 437.50 vs. $ 436.50 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 82 cents an ounce to close at $ 440. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, where the metal was trading at $ 6.74 a troy ounce, compared with $ 6.66 Thursday.

<HEAD>Allis-Chalmers Files Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, once a giant farm equipment manufacturer, on Friday filed a formal reorganization plan that would formalize the sale its principal businesses. The plan, the final step required to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. The company, which sought protection from its creditors last year, said in a statement that the sales of major assets would raise between $ 400 million and $ 425 million, which would be distributed to creditors. <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> already arranged for the sales of its assets. Last week the company announced an agreement to sell its pump business to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 71 million. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueche </PERSON> called the agreement `` the final final agreement necessary to complete our reorganization plan strategy for the sale or merger of our principal businesses as going concerns.'' In April <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> said it has agreed to sell its air quality control business for $ 245 million to <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The company estimated that, after the payment of priority claims and secured debt, unsecured creditors will recover approximately 16 to 21 percent of their claims. The reorganized <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> would, under the plan, include an office in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and two wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. They are <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates a machinery repair facility in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> KILnGAS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has four employees in its current development phase and manages a coal gasification project at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Allis-Chalmers </ORGANIZATION> said that the plan was conditional, among other things, on the closing of previously announced sales of the company's air filter, pump and power generation services businesses The company's existing common stock holders would receive no cash distributions and approximately 20.6 percent of the reorganized company's common stock. `` The company's goal is to have the plan consummated by year-end 1988,'' <PERSON> Bueche </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Post Limit Gains; Oat Rally Called Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn prices soared the limit for daily trading Friday but oat futures dropped sharply in what analysts said might be a signal of the end of a record-breaking rally. Wheat and soybeans advanced strongly in other action on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. On other markets, pork futures plunged the daily trading limit while cattle futures were mixed; crude oil prices dropped below $ 15 a barrel; precious metals were slightly higher; and stock-index futures retreated. Forecasts for a warm, dry July 4 weekend in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> underpinned gains in most grain and soybean markets. `` Corn was very strong and rumors of Russian buying were rampant,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the Soviets were believed to have purchased 500,000 to 1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and an unknown amount of Argentine corn. Most corn contracts advanced the 10-cents-a-bushel limit and the limitless contract for July delivery rose even higher. Gains in the wheat and soybean pits, while substantial, were slowed by Thursday's monthly grain stocks report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which showed larger-than-expected stocks of corn, wheat and soybeans, <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> said. But it was another story in the oat pit, where prices dropped sharply on ideas that the drought-driven rally in that market was over. <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON> cited rumors of oat imports from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Other experts said the reality of yield losses had finally caught up with the futures market. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oat crop, grown primarily in the northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, `` is basically at maturity or close enough to maturity that very little more damage is going to be done to it now than is already known,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Oat futures prices, which hit a record $ 3.94 a bushel Thursday, likely will slip as supply-and-demand factors replace drought-damage fears, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. `` I think we've seen our highs for the year,'' said independent oat trader <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Homan </PERSON>. The full extent of damage to the corn crop probably will become apparent next week as stunted plants pass through the critical pollination stage and speculation will continue to drive the soybean market for another month, he said. `` You've got reality -LRB- in the oat market -RRB-, then you're a week away from reality -LRB- for corn -RRB- and a month away from reality -LRB- for soybeans -RRB- and that's how the market traded today,'' <PERSON> Homan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a 6-to-10-day forecast after the close calling for hot, dry weather in most major growing areas for the period July 7-11. Wheat settled 10 -LCB- cents to 15 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 4.00 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 9 -RCB- cents to 15 cents higher with July at $ 3.42 a bushel; oats were 21 cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $ 3.32 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 17 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 9.88 -LCB- a bushel. As expected, pork futures plummeted their daily limits at the opening on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and remained locked limit-down all day in reaction to Thursday's surprising <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report showing larger-than-expected increases in both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hog herd and the breeding intentions of hog producers. Live cattle were unchanged to .95 cent higher with August at 64.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent lower to .42 cent higher with August at 73.67 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower across the board with July at 44.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with July at 35.25 cents a pound. Crude oil prices slumped below $ 15 a barrel to their lowest levels in almost two years after fluctuating wildly on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts were divided on the reasons for the drop. Some cited technical factors while others pegged the drop to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s desire to see lower oil prices West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 22 cents lower with August at $ 14.94 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent to .10 cent lower with August at 41.02 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .39 cent lower to .29 cent higher with August at 48.35 cents a gallon. Precious metals futures advanced slightly in light, choppy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold was $ 1.90 to $ 2 higher with August at $ 439.60 a troy ounce; silver was .40 cent lower to 2.5 cents higher with July at $ 6.703 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index finished 2.5 points lower at 272.90.

<HEAD>CSX Loses $160 Million In 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported a second-quarter loss of $ 160 million mainly because of a $ 778 million special charge that will in part cover severance payments to laid-off employees. Excluding the charge, second quarter earnings would have been $ 332 million, or $ 2.12 per share. In the year-ago quarter, the transportation, energy and technology conglomerate earned $ 114 million, or 74 cents a share. Of the special charge, $ 592 million will be used for costs related to reducing the rail labor force to about 30,000 employees. About 8,200 employees will receive payments ranging from $ 30,000 to $ 50,000, except for locomotive enginemen who are covered under an existing program that calls for payments of $ 75,000. The remaining $ 186 million of the special charge covers various costs and claims pending against <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> and certain subsidiaries. Those costs are expected to result from litigation and negotiated settlements. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Operating Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON> said the employee reduction program is part of <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to match the number of rail employees with the operating requirements of the rail system. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Snow said <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, since its formation in 1980, has reduced the physical base of <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> from 26,748 route miles, 3,343 locomotives and 175,281 freight cars at year-end 1981 to 21,494 route miles, 2,633 locomotives and 116,063 freight cars at year-end 1987. For the first six months of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 95 million, compared with earnings of $ 199 million, or $ 1.29 per share for the first half of 1987. Without the special charge, first half earnings would have been $ 397 million, or $ 2.52 per share.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Fall; Construction Spending Rises</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels in almost two years, a development that helped cool inflation concerns and lift bond prices. The contract for August delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, plunged 22 cents per 42-gallon barrel Friday, piercing the $ 15 level to settle at $ 14.94 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Along with the fall in oil, bond prices were boosted modestly by a stronger dollar and fresh foreign demand. The yield of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond, which falls when prices rise, dipped to 8.83 percent from 8.85 percent late Thursday. In other economic news, construction of offices and factories increased strongly in May, the government said Friday in a report that indicated healthy economic growth. On Wall Street, stock prices fell and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 10.13 points to 2,131.58, closing out the week with a net loss of 11.38 points. Overall construction spending advanced 1.1 percent in May, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The increase was led by a 7.8 percent advance in office construction and a 7.7 percent advance in factory construction. In contrast, residential construction fell 1 percent. The big jump in factory construction reflected the capital spending boom occurring as manufacturers rush to expand capacity to meet sharply higher demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. Analysts said the rise in office construction, after a sustained period of weakness, reflected strong activity in certain sections of the country such as the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and a halt to the giant plunge in building which had occurred in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, hard hit because of troubles in the oil patch. `` Cities such as <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, are enjoying good economic growth and a fair amount of offfice construction,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, senior economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is happening while the sharp declines in other areas have at least bottomed out.''

 Crude oil prices plunged through the psychologically important $ 15-a-barrel level to their lowest price in almost two years during a chaotic trading session. The contract for August delivery of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, plunged 22 cents a barrel on Friday to settle at $ 14.94 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Crude prices have not finished as low since Dec. 10, 1986, when the near-term contract closed at $ 14.92 per 42-gallon barrel. The price on near-term contracts has dropped from $ 16.83 a barrel since the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> agreed on June 14 to extend its previous production quotas, which have not prevented an oversupply of crude oil. Prices of refined products traded on the exchange were mixed Friday. The July contract for home heating oil edged down 0.06 cent to 41.02 cents a gallon. The July contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 48.35 cents, up 0.29 cent from Thursday's session. Traders noted that the chaotic activity was unusual for what typically is a subdued session ahead of the long Independence Day weekend. Crude prices fluctuated in a wide range, trading up to $ 15.44 a barrel early in the session before dropping below $ 15 after noon. The lower prices were met with strong buying from investors on the sidelines. `` There's good buying around here,'' said <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION>. `` The sellers are the ones who are hurting.'' Analysts were divided over the reason for the selloff. Some said that consistently lower oil prices finally convinced investors it was time to swallow their losses and sell off contracts that were purchased at higher prices. `` They're having to cut their hurt,'' <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said. `` Those who bought above $ 16 a barrell ... are trying to get out.'' But others suggested some of the selling might have been undertaken on behalf of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which hoped lower prices would choke off oil revenue for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, removing a financing tool in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 7-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Lower oil prices could cut off `` the supplies of money to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and bring the war machine to a grinding halt,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an assistant director at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, some speculated the Saudis would rather lower prices than see <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies explore for oil. The decline came on the heels of a sharp drop in the previous session. On Thursday, the near-term contract of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate fell 27 cents to finish at its lowest level since Dec. 21, 1987. The drop came amid fears of a possible price war after <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> announced it would cut the price on its crude oil exports for the first half of July.

Many of the Chevrolet rebates will be leaner, but <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> rebates will continue unchanged except for the LeSabre, which was dropped from the program, a spokeswoman said.
