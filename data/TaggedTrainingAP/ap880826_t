 Representatives of 2,200 striking registered nurses reached a tentative agreement with six private hospitals Friday for pay raises of 21 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. The tentative pact was reached after the hospitals' negotiating board accepted a proposal from the <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, spokesman for Affiliated Hospitals, which is handling negotiations for the medical centers. The nurses will return to work by Wednesday if the contract is approved, <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. They went on strike Aug. 2. If approved, the pact would end a citywide labor conflict that at one point involved 4,000 nurses and hospital employees at eight medical facilities. The labor dispute involved two unions and three separate strikes. Nurses at the private hospitals last week turned down an offer of a 20 percent increase over three years by a 2-1 margin. The nurses were seeking 21 percent over two years. Under the tentative pact, nurses would receive an 8 percent pay raise the first year of the contract, compared with the 7.5 percent first-year raise in the previous offer, said nurses' spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardoni </PERSON>. `` The 8 percent the first year is very important in bringing Affiliated up to the standards of other area hospitals,'' <PERSON> Bardoni </PERSON> said. The increase would be over a 34-month period. The tentative agreement also carries improved language on staffing levels and higher weekend differential pay. A ratification vote was set for Sunday. Union officials are endorsing the proposal and predicted approval, <PERSON> Bardoni </PERSON> said. They also had recommended approval of the earlier offer. Some 1,700-members of Local 250 of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> began returning to work this week after reaching agreement with seven hospitals on a two-year pact that will restore fringe benefits and short-term sick leave. Under the pact, some workers will get raises of up to 6 percent over the life of the pact and others will get bonuses of up to $ 300 at the end of two years. The union had gone on strike July 26.

<HEAD>Aquino OKs Measures to Block Marcos' Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> approved legal measures Friday to block the return of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has asked a court to grant him permission to come home and face an accuser. At a meeting with key legal advisers, she authorized Solicitor-General <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> to file a motion with the anti-corruption court to reject <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' petition to come home when a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister gives a deposition against him in November. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said that if the lower tribunal upholds <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' request, the government will appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to keep the former president from coming home from <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he fled after a February 1986 uprising that toppled his administration and propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. In a petition filed Wednesday with the anti-corruption court, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> asked permission to return so he could defend himself when <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, the former public works minister, gives a deposition on alleged kickbacks by Japanese firms during the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration. The former minister is not related to the president. The anti-graft court said last week that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had the right to be present and cross-examine <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> if the testimony was to be used in criminal proceedings. The anti-corruption court stopped short of ordering <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return, however, and <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> indicated the government will use all legal means to prevent <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from coming to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman Gemmo <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> withheld comment on the government's plans because `` we are confused by all the reports'' on the proceedings. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said the government was trying to reconcile `` the demands of the judiciary and the demands of national security.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> cited national security as the main reason for preventing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from coming back from his exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. But she has also pledged to abide by the decision of the courts, even if they order <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> home. Pro-Marcos groups within the armed forces have been responsible for at least two of the half dozen major coup attempts against the Aquino government. Key leaders of those coup attempts remain at large. Philippine law bans trials in absentia, and the government has delayed filing charges against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for fear he would demand the right to return. The government claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> embezzled up to $ 10 billion during his administration. Efforts to recover the money have foundered, in large part because of the reluctance to file criminal charges.

<TEXT>
 Federal agents searched half a dozen state Capitol offices belonging to lawmakers or their aides as part of an apparent corruption probe, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and a state senator said Thursday. Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, the Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, the Republican floor leader of that chamber, confirmed that their offices were among those searched by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. But both denied involvement in any improper activities. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> refused to reveal the names of the lawmakers or even the subject of the investigation, but a <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said all of the parties named in the search warrants were involved in the passage of a bill involving investment banking regulations. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide who received one of the search warrants, chief sergeant at arms <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, said the warrants specified documents related to a vetoed bill involving investment banking law. At least one office was searched for more than three hours, sources said. `` What I can tell you is that anything I have received in the way of contributions or honoraria is always done as prescribed by law,'' said <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, who confirmed that federal agents searched his office. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> also confirmed that agents were seeking information on the investment banking law bill. `` I guess they wanted to check things out,'' he said, adding that agents were seeking information about two measures that passed through his committee. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> executed warrants Wednesday on the offices of six legislators and legislative assistants,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the Sacramento <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office. `` The searches were in connection with an ongoing investigation,'' and were conducted late Wednesday, he added. A Capitol employee said a team of about 30 federal investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office served search warrants on the lawmakers' offices. `` All I know is some agents came in last night and served some warrants. There were no arrests, no obvious scene. I ca n't tell you who -LRB- was served -RRB-,'' the source said. `` My office and the offices of several members from both parties were searched last night by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. It is not clear to me yet what the object of the investigation is, but I am confident that when the investigation is completed, my office will be completely cleared,'' <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said in a written statement.

 The owner of a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> social club where a fire killed six patrons was arrested Thursday and charged with manslaughter and assault for maintaining the basement club in a reckless manner, police said. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 37, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, was arrested at a pay phone in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> after police traced a 45-minute call he made from a phone booth to a precinct house, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. He was charged with six counts of second-degree manslaughter and some 40 counts of assault for every person that was in the club last Sunday at the time of the fire, he said. `` The section of the penal law that he's charged with, it covers death caused in a reckless manner,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. `` He maintained the club in such a way it was reckless and that's where his responsibility to the deaths comes in,'' he said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said police had been searching for <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> since the fire at the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> club, known as The Hole. `` He had an impending sense that they were looking for him,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said in explaining why <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> may have called police. When <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> saw the unmarked cars pull up to the phone booth and detectives getting out, `` he ran and there was a brief foot chase'' before he was captured, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>. Dozens of club patrons were injured in the fire, many severely burned. Eighteen firefighters also were hurt, none seriously. Officials said the club was operated illegally because it served liquor without a license and did n't have enough exits to comply with building codes. Although arson was initially suspected, the fire was later ruled to have been accidental.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was branded a public enemy three years ago for defending black youths involved in a north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> riot in which a policeman was hacked to death. Today, far from being hounded out of public life, 44-year-old <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> is a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and perhaps the most influential black politician in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. When <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Boateng </PERSON> won seats for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the June 1987 election to become the first blacks ever to enter the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, many hailed it as a breakthrough for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 2.4 million blacks. Those who feared that <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s flamboyant radicalism would prove disruptive have been confounded. With his greying beard, gap-toothed smile and melodious <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> accent, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> has emerged as a charming conversationalist and a dedicated parliamentarian. `` I suppose some people must have expected me to act in a certain way and they were probably surprised,'' he said in an interview. `` But I have n't adjusted my approach to politics in any way.'' That approach holds that the 4-percent black minority `` are at the bottom of the pile'' and becoming `` a powder keg'' in the inner cities. `` I would n't be surprised if there were another disturbance tomorrow,'' he said. `` It's there and it's going to happen because the government is n't paying any attention to it. `` We've got our backs to the wall, and we're fighting against a very racist government that discriminates against black people. `` The problem I think black people are facing now is n't the overt racism that to a large extent happened in the 60s ... but it's the unconscious racism, the racism of the people that make policy that will affect a large amount of black people adversely.'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> emigrated from his native <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, a former British colony on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s northeast coast, to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1963. Here he became the first black ever to head a municipal council, leading the north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> borough of <LOCATION> Haringey </LOCATION> for three years. He burst into national prominence in 1985 when an impoverished housing project in the <LOCATION> Tottenham </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Haringey </LOCATION> erupted in riots and the policeman was hacked to death _ the first ever to die in British race-related unrest. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> accused the predominantly white police force of sparking the violence and, in his most controversial utterance, said the blacks felt they had given the police `` a bloody good hiding -LRB- thrashing -RRB-.'' He insisted he was not seeking to justify the killing but simply explaining how other blacks felt about it. The effect was incendiary. The right-wing tabloid press called him `` Barmy <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON>,'' Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> branded him `` a high priest of race conflict,'' and nearly 1,000 <LOCATION> Haringey </LOCATION> borough workers staged a one-day strike demanding his resignation. His white girlfriend, councilor <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, received death threats. `` I've never denied it,'' he says now, `` I've never regretted it, I've never withdrawn what I said. My position at the time was to put forward the views of the young people. `` It defused the situation. A lot of the newspapers turned on me. ... I was quite clear in what I was doing.'' In the 1987 election, he carried <ORGANIZATION> Tottenham </ORGANIZATION>, where 37 percent of the electorate are black or Asian, with a sharply reduced Labor majority. In his maiden speech to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said that unless young blacks were offered better prospects, `` they will find other means of expressing their frustration.'' He claims police still harass black youths, using unnecessary force and planting evidence. When he first arrived in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said, he underwent an initiation ceremony in which seven or eight legislators from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gathered around him in the Smoking Room and `` sort of baited me'' with racial innuendo. `` They were deliberately trying to create an incident, but it did n't work,'' he said. `` I was quite cool.'' When a doorman tried to eject him from the public gallery `` even though he knew who I was,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> threatened to withdraw from the daily business of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> until the Speaker examined his complaint. The doorman apologized. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> has confronted Parliament with issues ranging from alleged harassment of blacks in the armed forces to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s `` hands-off'' policy toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But he said he has problems with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> too. He charges that its hierarchical system keeps black politicians out of the limelight and ignores his expertise in local government and race relations. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said: `` I'm quite happy, despite all the faults of the place -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, to be there. It's relatively easy compared to the pressure I was under when I was leader of Haringey Council. To some extent, the spotlight has been dimmed.''

<TEXT>
 An 800-pound, lovesick boar named <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> who's been hogging too much of his owner's attention lately has been put up for sale, but so far there have been few offers for the pining swine. `` A guy wanted to know if I would deliver him to <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>,'' said owner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON>, who is asking about $ 300 for <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>. `` There really have n't been any serious offers.'' The trouble with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> is that he's doubled in size since a friend gave him to <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON> about 6 months ago and is `` desperately in need of female companionship,'' according to the classified advertisement <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON> ran this week in the <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's just rooting up the fences and is constantly looking around and you can just tell by the noises he's making that he's desperately looking for females,'' <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> eats like, well, a pig, putting away close to five gallons of garbage a day, <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON> said. `` I feed him mostly garbage and of course the green stuff from the garden that's left over and he loves it all,'' he said. Neighbors bring their children to watch <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> at the trough. `` It's a huge, awful sight to see him eat,'' <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON> said. A cabinetmaker and construction worker who used to raise pigs, <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON> says he wo n't have enough time this winter to look after <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, whose currently living at a nearby farm along with four sheep and two horses. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, a blend of <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is about 5 feet long and has chewed through the planks of his pen with his 4-inch tusks. <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON> said selling his porcine pet for meat is n't likely to bring home the bacon because mature boar meat generally is n't good for anything more than catfood. However, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> is n't naturally boorish, even though he has made mistaken advances to the back of a pickup truck and was turned down for the local fair because there was n't a pen strong enough to hold him, <PERSON> Dewees </PERSON> said. `` He's really a very gentle fellow. He never has been aggressive as far as meanness is concerned. He really needs companionship.''

 Maybe in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> they let the mayor cook for himself and feast on his own sausage-and-sauerkraut. Maybe in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> they think that because the mayor is also a Jewish grandmother she can subsist on her own chicken soup. Not in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where a food trend is big news and Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s appetite _ and battle of the waistline _ are well-known. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the mayor gets a chef. And the chef can cause his own scandal. Because of an indiscretion in an administration that has seen some major corruption, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is looking for a new cook to share <LOCATION> Gracie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mansion </LOCATION>, the sprawling river-view estate the city provides him on the ritzy <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>. In what could be known as the Cheesecake Caper or Garlicgate, chef <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON> resigned when investigators determined he had improperly used city workers and facilities in his private catering and baking business. While authorities decided not to prosecute, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> ordered the cook _ known for his salmon with garlic, his chocolate chip cookies and his cheesecakes _ to quit or drop his outside work. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> elected to leave the mayor's employ, giving <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s staff a task few other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mayors ever have to deal with _ finding a new live-in chef. Few other cities even provide their mayors with a home, never mind a cook to live in it. That leaves most of them with a coffeemaker in the office and maybe a takeout menu in a desk drawer. `` We do things a little differently here in the West,'' said <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartak </PERSON>, spokeswoman for Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who is a bachelor like <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> but cooks for himself and lives in a bungalow he owns. `` Even our governor -LRB- Rose Mofford -RRB- is probably home fixing herself a bologna sandwich like the rest of us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bartak </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> furnishes Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> with a place to live, but on the rare occasion he dines there, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and his wife must fend for themselves, said Deputy Mayor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gage </PERSON>. Nevertheless, he did n't want to help <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> find a chef for <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> has some wonderful chefs, but we're not inclined to export them. We enjoy them here,'' <PERSON> Gage </PERSON> said. Up the coast, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> has to provide his own house _ and is struggling to make the payments _ said spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON>. Does he get a chef, at least? `` His wife wishes he did,'' said <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON>. Does n't cook for himself, eh? `` I've never seen him near a stove.'' It gets worse in small towns, apparently. Mayor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> in the small coastal <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> said he gets the following: `` No chef, no house, no car.'' He does, however, get a gasoline expense account in addition to his $ 125-a-week salary. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s salary is exactly 20 times higher at $ 130,000 a year. Some mayors seem to manage quite well without a chef, practicing the culinary arts themselves. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is `` a connoisseur of chili,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. `` He's also got a sausage and sauerkraut dish that he puts together.'' And in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Masloff </PERSON>, a Jewish grandmother, is known to make a good pot of chicken soup and a great batch of cookies. But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the tradition of hiring someone to cook for the mayor seems well entrenched. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> and the city archives could n't say which mayor was the first to have a city-provided chef, but all agreed that several men who served before <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> assumed office in 1978 enjoyed the perquisite. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the chef's position, which pays $ 51,000 a year, saves the city money because of the banquets <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> holds and the entertaining he does as chief executive of the nation's largest city. Besides, they say the cheesecake is really tasty.

 <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> are like twins in the womb of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The tiny nations, landlocked in the center of the continent, are a mirror image of each other, with common histories and languages and ethnic likenesses. Cloaked by clouds that crown hills and mountain peaks and the smoke from thousands of cooking fires, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> are two of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most beautiful _ and poorest _ countries. They also are among the most obscure. During the past quarter century, they have shared one of the world's worst ethnic disputes: the unrest between the majority <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON> minority that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The bloodletting that runs through the histories of both countries, like the meandering <LOCATION> Akanyaru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that marks their common border, began anew Aug. 14. Hutu tribesmen in two northern <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> communes set upon their Tutsi neighbors, hacking them to death with machetes and burning them alive in huts, refugees and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> officials say. The Tutsi-dominated army was sent north as peacemaker, but the soldiers turned executioners after discovering the carnage inflicted on their tribesmen. How the most recent bloodbath began is unclear. But historically, it has taken little to set either side off on a murderous rampage. Gravediggers have confirmed at least 5,000 people killed. But hundreds of Burundians, mostly <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON>, who fled into <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> to escape the army's onslaught, insist that more people were left behind dead than the 40,000 who crossed the <LOCATION> Akanyaru </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to refuge in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. `` In the beginning, there were many bodies floating along the river,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Munyakayanza </PERSON>, one of the officials in charge of three camps of refugees who have settled on the hillside overlooking the marshy plain that leads to their former homes. The refugees in both camps and six similar camps are mostly Hutus and they say their former homesteads are now killing grounds. The <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> government denies army-led massacres, but refugees are arriving in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> with knife slashes, burns and bullet and shrapnel wounds. Tribal problems exist in virtually every African country. But modern weapons, the centuries-old feud and a pressure on land unlike anywhere else in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, have led to frequent genocidal orgies in <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> ruled <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> as one territory known as Rwanda-Urundi under a League of Nations and later <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> trusteeship from 1917 until 1962, when both countries were given their independence. From 1899 until the end of World War I in 1917, the area was part of <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Major ethnic problems in the region date from the 15th century when the Tutsi _ tall and elegant <ORGANIZATION> Nilotic </ORGANIZATION> people _ migrated from <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and imposed feudal rule on the short, stocky <LOCATION> Bantu </LOCATION> people they found living in communes on the blue-green mountains and hillsides. Today, the Tutsi govern <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, while the Hutu control <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>. The Hutu are the majority in both countries, making up 84 percent of the population, and the Tutsi the minority, at 15 percent. Nowadays, competition for space on the rolling landscape is at the root of much of the ethnic animosity. Most of the people in both countries are farmers. <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most densely populated state, with 6.1 million people crammed into an area about the size of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> is roughly the same size as its northern neighbor and has 5 million people. When independence came to <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, the Hutu assumed political power through the sheer weight of numbers. Their coming to power was aided by a 1959 Hutu uprising in which 20,000 to 100,000 of the then-ruling <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON> were slaughtered and 200,000 more fled into <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>. The Tutsi held on to power in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> even after independence and have kept the Hutu subservient with guns and intimidation. In 1972, <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> tried to overthrow the government beginning with a massacre of hundreds of <PERSON> Tutsi </PERSON>. The rebellion was crushed and the government, in reprisals, killed between 100,000 and 300,000 Hutu, including most of the tribe's intelligentsia, according to human rights groups. `` The Tutsi live in mortal fear knowing they are in the minority,'' said an American missionary who lived and worked in <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> from 1960 to 1970 and spoke on condition of anonymity. `` They fear that some <PERSON> Hutu </PERSON> leader is going to rally the people around him and they know that will be the Tutsis' death knell.''

 Correspondent Sein Win, 66, has reported for the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> since 1968. As a reporter and newspaper editor he was imprisoned in 1960 by <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> governments and on July 29 was picked up again and released Thursday after being held for 28 days. Here is his first person account:

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 I was arrested on the night of July 29 with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in the grip of authoritarian rule. When I left prison Thursday, I entered a new country. As I emerged from jail I witnessed an incredible thing: For the first time in a quarter century, people _ thousands and thousands of them _ were chanting, crying for democracy, and there were no secret police, no soldiers with bayonets fixed and with fingers on the triggers to stop the demonstrators. I was picked up along with nine others, including dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> who had earlier this year sent a series of letters to strongman Ne Win pointing to political, economic and human rights problems in the country and urging reform. We had been accused of something akin to treason although no evidence was ever produced against me. During imprisonment in a special solitary cell measuring 16 feet by 14 feet I was never told of the tumultuous events sweeping <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>: the ouster of President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> after 17 days in power, killings of unarmed demonstrators, mass uprisings demanding the return of democracy, which had once briefly flickered. After the authorities barged into my house at 10 p.m. and hauled me off, my family sent a telex to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. `` Daddy has been taken away.'' it said. `` He wo n't be able to answer your queries.'' When Ne Win retired and was replaced as head of the ruling party by <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> last month, one of the first acts of the new leadership was to order our arrest. Challenged openly by the <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> letters, which were reprinted and sold like hot cakes, the government had apparently decided to crack down quickly. We were taken to Insein Prison, eight miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, interrogated separately, and charged under a new law of `` attacking the state,'' comparable to high treason. The cells were furnished with a table, chair, bed, mattress, blanket and mosquito net. A bath with running water was attached. Food was good. There was a cup of milk and an egg in the morning, another cup of milk in the afternoon. The two main meals included meat and soup. Except for loneliness, the thirst for news from the outside and uncertainty over my future, life was not so bad. I had more than enough time for <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> meditation. I found out later that my house was searched for four hours but nothing incriminating had been found. My answers to the interrogators were simple: My frequent visits to <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> were to gather news. He also was an old, friend. Jail was not new to me. As editor of the English-language `` The Guardian'' newspaper, I tried to do my part in fostering a free press in the country and was jailed for nearly a month in 1960 under the Official Secrets and Emergency Provision Acts. I was let out on bail and the government withdrew the charges after a year's trial. After Ne Win seized power in a 1962 coup, thousands of real or imagined opponents were arrested, I was among them, spending three years under `` protective custody'' without interrogation or trial. The lastest incarceration was far shorter than I expected. That perhaps can be accounted for by the rapidly changing events in the country. After 26 years of seemingly passive acceptance of authoritarian rule, hundreds of thousands in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, Prome, <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moulmein </LOCATION> and elsewhere announced boldly that they had had enough. I saw them when they opened the prison doors Thursday. I got caught in crowd of demonstrators, delaying my return home. I could hardly belive my eyes. Returning home, reunited with my wife and children who for the 28 days had received no word of my whereabouts or condition, I did what I have been doing for most of my adult life. I sat down at the telex and filed a story.

<TEXT>
 The wreath by the Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> into central <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> is a reminder of how quickly the balance can shift in the treacherous ebb and flow of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> conflict. The wreath commemorates Lt. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, a naval recruiting officer who was blown up by a bomb while driving into <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Monday, the 26th British military man to die in an Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attack this year. Beyond the bridge, workers clear the wreckage left by an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> car bomb that exploded in the commercial heart of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The army deaths are a sharp increase from 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> managed to kill only three soldiers, while the bombing is a sobering reminder to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> not to take for granted the peace and prosperity that has blossomed in its business and entertainment center over six relatively bomb-free years. <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> successes usually go in short, bloody bursts, and no one knows how long this one will last. But it represents at least a temporary change of fortunes for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in its campaign to rid <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> of British rule and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Ever since November, when a bomb massacred 12 Protestant civilians at a war memorial ceremony in <LOCATION> Enniskillen </LOCATION>, little had gone right for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. Blunder after blunder left a trail of 18 innocent dead, <ORGANIZATION> Protestants </ORGANIZATION> as well as the blue-collar Roman Catholics whose interests the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claims to represent. Thus the shift to attacks on soldiers, with little risk to civilians, is a morale booster for <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters, who were feeling increasingly embarrassed at seeing the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly having to excuse its mistakes. Things got so bad that <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, had to warn the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> publicly to `` get its house in order.'' The attacks on the army have taken place in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but the deadliest have been in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where six off-duty soldiers were blown up in their van in June, and eight died in a bus bombed last Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s bolstered spirits were reflected in its boast that it smuggled Tuesday's bomb in central <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> through a massive security net, and that in future, a sophisticated system of non-defusible explosives would be used to set off more bombs, combined with remote-control smoke grenades to warn off bystanders. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> are on a ` high' at the moment, flush with weapons and explosives, but it can not be sustained, because against a resolute government there is no way they can convert their violence into the political concessions they demand,'' commented The <ORGANIZATION> Belfast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s most influential newspaper. The government, responding to anguished Protestant appeals for tougher anti-IRA measures, says it has taken decisions which it says are being kept secret but will `` soon become apparent.'' Newspapers speculate that these include sending in more troops, extending legal powers to hold suspects, and tightening cooperation with the Irish police to close the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s refuges south of the border. But as the Telegraph itself noted, most of the ideas have already been tried, `` and for every argument in favor of radical change, there is another to say that it might make things worse.'' Some analysts imagine the fighting reaching a stalemate in which the British agree to talk about troop withdrawal, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accepts a truce, and all parties acknowledge the futility of violence and sit down for peace talks. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION>, believes Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is too deeply committed to fighting terrorism to agree to anything that smacks of a deal with the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> believes the only way the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> will be defeated is if enough Catholics are revolted by the bloodshed to expunge the gunmen from their midst. That's why killing soldiers makes the most sense for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. Civilian deaths only provoke revulsion, while killing local policemen and militiamen gets marginal publicity in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, compared with the death of a soldier who has been sent in from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The struggle at present is shaped mainly by propaganda needs. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> aims to turn the British public off <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and into a mood to bring the boys back home. `` The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> people need to ask if there is not another way,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` They should actively press for their government to withdraw.'' The British government counters with the charge that the weapons and explosives fueling the summer blitz have come from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. These supplies, says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the government's <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary, `` may have given some people the idea that somehow violence can actually win.''

<HEAD>Bat Colony Chase Owners From House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A colony of more than 2,000 bats has chased a couple from their home of 15 years, and one of them says `` it's too scary'' to move back until they're sure the winged invaders are gone. After dark each day, <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Disburger </PERSON> watch brown bats flutter in and out of the yellow wood-frame house. They said they have n't been able to find anyone to help them solve their problem, largely because they have trouble getting people to believe them. `` I'll never forget the night we left,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Disburger </PERSON> said recently. `` I could n't sleep. I was too scared. You could hear them. It was one of those hot nights and it was like the house was breathing. `` We had the lights on bright,'' she said. `` The bats were right in the next room. Then one lit on <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>'s leg. That did it. We went outside and slept the rest of the night in our camper. The next morning I begged my mother-in-law to take us in.'' That was July 15, and they have n't been back to their central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> home since except to do laundry and grab a few possessions. Disburger used heavy plastic to seal off the unfinished second-floor room that seems to be the colony's nursery. But his wife does n't want to go near the house if she can help it. `` It's too scary,'' she said. She said she's been frustrated in trying to get help from pest control experts, local and state health officials and legislators. The Disburgers have tried ultra-sound, mothball crystals and smoke bombs to get rid of the bats. The only weapon that worked was a tennis racquet, but smashing a bat creates possible exposure to rabies and disease carried by the flying mammals. On Thursday, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON>, a zoologist with the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wadsworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> who specializes in rodent and bat diseases, visited the Disburger home. `` Judging from what I've heard, it's certainly a problem,'' <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> said before the visit. `` The large number of bats reported is unusual, but not rare. This year, there seems to be more people with serious problems.'' The couple said they noticed more and more bats starting to appear at the house about five years ago. They'd disappear in the winter but would come back in spring, she said. The Disburgers tried their best to plug up their old house. They'd sit in the camper at night and watch the entrances and exits used by the bats. <PERSON> Disburger </PERSON> had ladders ready all around the exterior; he'd run and get some insulation and plug a hole. The couple said they expect to spend up to $ 4,000 to rid their house of the winged varmints. That includes scattering the colony, plugging all the holes and putting on a new roof. <PERSON> Frantz </PERSON> said he was thinking of sealing up most of the holes in the house, then installing one-way exits in the remaining ones. When the bats leave at night to feed, he said, they wo n't be able to get return.

<HEAD>Birth Defects Still Major Cause Of Premature Death In U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Birth defects such as lung abnormalities, cardiovascular problems and chromosome disorders continue to rank as the nation's fifth leading causes of premature loss of life, federal health researchers say. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which tabulates `` years of potential life lost'' nationwide to determine the role of various conditions in premature mortality, reported Thursday that in 1986, birth defects robbed their victims of 651,523 years of life they would have lived before age 65. That ranked fifth among all causes of premature life-years lost, the Atlanta-based agency said. Ranking first was unintentional injury, resulting in about 2.4 million lost life-years, followed by cancers, heart disease and suicide and homicide. Birth defects have ranked fifth in all previous studies of premature mortality published as far back as 1984, said researcher <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>. `` As infant mortality due to other causes has been reduced -LRB- with advances in prenatal care and medical treatment -RRB-, congenital anomalies -LRB- birth defects -RRB- have become the leading cause of infant mortality,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. In detailed statistics from 1985, the latest year for which such data are available, the leading category of premature mortality from birth defects was lung abnormality _ either impartial development or abnormal growth of the lungs. Those conditions accounted for more than 9 percent of the life-years lost to birth defects, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Ranking behind lung abnormalities as a cause of premature loss of life were conditions where infants were born with incomplete brains, or with arrested development of the left side of the heart. Further, six of the 15 leading birth defects in the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s premature mortality analysis were defects of the cardiovascular system Three chromosome defects, including Down's syndrome, were also included in the top 15. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> uses age 65 as a statistical benchmark in its premature mortality studies; most average American life expectancies are somewhat higher.

 Three fine actresses take all the parts in `` From the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION>,'' a strong, evocative evening of theater by <PERSON> Endesha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> at off-Broadway's Theater Four. The presentation by the <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ensemble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> has nine sections, stronger than vignettes, which weave individual lives through a <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> small-town tapestry from the early 1950s into the 1980s. Humor and personal tragedy are well-balanced in the play which begins with a prologue of reminiscenses. In the first `` chapter,'' `` Calm, Balmy Days,'' <PERSON> Latanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> plays a white grandmother who takes an 11-year-old black girl, played by <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Denmark </PERSON>, home to babysit her granddaughter, played by <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts-Frost </PERSON>. The grandmother then calls the babysitter into the bedroom so her husband can rape her. This is followed by the evening's strongest section, `` Second Doctor Lady.'' Miss <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> plays Ai n't Baby, a name she received when she no longer was the baby in her family. Now middle-aged, she is a wonderful midwife. With the other two actresses narrating dramatically and playing children peeking through a back window, Ai n't Baby delivers a breech-birth baby. `` The Water Meter'' is the funniest section of the evening. A white meter reader tells a gullible old black woman that if anybody steps on her ground-level meter her water bill will skyrocket. The old woman has a pile of bricks and a notoriously bad aim so children and drunks enjoy the challenge. Then northern Civil Rights workers arrive and a black girl cooperates with them. Whites burn down her mother's shack with the mother inside. It ends with a preacher praying the mother into heaven and the girl going north to college. The playwright, a native of <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, has a Ph.D. from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. She is associate professor of American studies at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workshop </ORGANIZATION>, directed. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> designed the set, the back of which is the spare frame of a house. The first <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> production of the play was at the Henry Street Settlement.

<HEAD>Archbishop Quits Democratic Party Over Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s top Roman Catholic cleric has ended his longtime affiliation with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and reregistered as a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> because of the Democrats' stances on birth control and abortion rights. Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whealon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> announced his decision to quit the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in his weekly column in `` The Catholic Transcript,'' the archdiocesan weekly newspaper appearing Friday. <PERSON> Whealon </PERSON> did n't say in his column that he had registered as a Republican, but he made the switch last week, according to officials in the office of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> registrar of voters. <PERSON> Whealon </PERSON> complained the Democratic platform drafted during the recent national convention `` is in favor of contraception and abortion, financed by the government.'' He said the Republican Party platform expressed support for the family and opposed abortion. `` In 1860, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was on the wrong side on the moral question of slavery. It is on the wrong side of the more serious moral question of abortion. Therefore, reluctantly, I am unable in conscience to remain a registered Democrat. Feeling abandoned, I hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> regains its moral principles and soul,'' the archbishop wrote. <PERSON> Whealon </PERSON> had been registered as a Democrat in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> since 1969. `` I had no idea what his political affiliation was, and I do n't know that anyone else did either,'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Droney </PERSON> said Thursday `` We're glad to have him aboard,'' said <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kezer </PERSON>, vice chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 The soldiers call it the `` rush hour.'' Each day at about 4 p.m., groups of Palestinian youths barricade streets with burning tires and hurl stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Each time, the soldiers give chase through the narrow winding streets of the city's outdoor market. `` It's some sort of a game, but it gets serious from time to time,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON>, a reservist who was identified only by his first name in keeping with army regulations. As he spoke, a column of black smoke rose from a burning tire, signaling the start of the daily ritual of disturbances in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of 120,000. The soldiers in <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON>'s company say they are weary and frustrated with the lethal game that by army count has left 15 Nablus Arabs dead and nearly 150 injured in the past two months. `` It's like chasing our tail. If we go up the hill, they go down. If we go down, they go up,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON>. As he and the other soldiers spoke to a reporter on a hillside road, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths sneaked up and pelted stones at the soldiers. The soldiers dashed down the hill, but the youths had vanished. Lt. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON>, a student in his 20s, and Pvt. <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON>, a farmer in his 30s, pulled up in a jeep with a makeshift top of spare tires and wire mesh serving as a protection against cement blocks dropped from rooftops. `` I do n't want rocks dropped on my head, and I do n't want to shoot them. But if I do n't have a choice ...'' said <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON>, his sentence ending in a shrug. Soldiers have orders to refrain from firing unless their lives are in danger or they are the targets of firebombs. For all other threats, they are supposed to use tear gas, rubber bullets or plastic bullets. `` Frankly speaking, almost anything can be life-threatening,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON>, fatigue showing in the dark smudges under his eyes. He said soldiers faced three to four dangerous situations every day and it was often a struggle to maintain restraint. The threats ranged from ball bearings fired from slingshots to stones hurled at drivers. `` It's difficult to tell soldiers they have to stay cool. After three weeks of this, everyone gets mad,'' said <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON>, a textile merchant and veteran of the 1982-85 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war. `` I explain every day to the men that to shoot three or four Arabs is not going to solve the problem or move us forward one bit.'' During a daylong tour with soldiers in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 37 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a reporter heard the crackle of gunfire about 20 times, although most were apparently warning shots. By army count, one <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was wounded in the leg by live ammunition, two by experimental plastic bullets and two by rubber bullets. At one point, the radio on Maj. <PERSON> Elkana </PERSON>'s jeep crackled and a soldier manning a lookout post asked permission to shoot. He proposed using a .22 - caliber rifle to shoot at the legs of about 20 protesters erecting barricades on a main thoroughfare `` Absolutely not,'' snapped <LOCATION> Elkana </LOCATION>. `` You are not to shoot without my authorization.'' <LOCATION> Elkana </LOCATION>, 32, from a kibbutz near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, said soldiers had to show a presence throughout the city because `` we are the law here.'' But he said he did not normally send his men into the maze-like network of narrow alleyways that made up the old city as long as Palestinians did not try to block main roads. `` See that fire?'' he said, pointing to a burning tire about 100 yards from the main road. `` I'm going to let it go. If we try to put it out, they will throw stones and then we have to run after them. I prefer to choose the time and place.'' One hour later, squads of 10 to 20 Palestinians tried to choke off a main street by simultaneously setting up burning barricades at both ends. Soldiers called in a bulldozer, which charged through one makeshift barricade, ripping open a water pipe that sprayed the smoldering debris. Other soldiers wearing helmets with face shields entered the marketplace. Members of the patrol could be seen frequently looking up at rooftops from where Palestinians have dropped bricks, large blocks and even refrigerators. `` The orders are to keep the situation under control. There is no way we can just let them do what they want. If we did, it would be total anarchy, just like <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON>.

 When Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> comes back from vacation after Labor Day, one of the first things he will have to do is set priorities from an immense list of foreign policy problems. There simply is not enough time left for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and others in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to take on all the woes of the world before ringing the curtain down in January. But the long list is tempting because so many problems suddenly seem ripe for solution, and a nudge from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could make a difference. In <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is front and center, using its influence to seek solutions to the twin problems of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. It could be argued that only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediation could have moved the Cubans and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to where they are now __ holding talks in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> that might pay off in independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The continuing unrest of the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> beckons for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intercession. In <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s absence, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave the Palestinian Arabs a lift by hinting they may be entitled to a separate seat in peace talks and by admonishing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for ordering 25 more deportations from the troubled territory. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is likely to give the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> one more college try by scheduling a fifth visit to the region this year. There is little evidence, though, that prospects for success have improved. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has made official what seemed obvious to many for so long: He will not assume the responsibility for negotiating a solution to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> dispute. Nor, with national elections looming in November, is <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> by any stretch of the imagination prepared to guarantee in advance of peace talks that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would withdraw from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, a rising star in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> party and son of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, reminded reporters during a think-tank session this week on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that Sept. 30 will mark the 50th anniversary of <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. The Sudeten in 1938 was a strategic buffer between <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. But it was absorbed by <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, setting the stage for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> to attack <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, with the argument that the rights of 3 million Sudeten Germans were being violated. Begin drew a parallel to the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs whose demands also have attracted important international support. The fact that an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> politician finds <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> relevant to today's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> illustrates the determination of a sizable segment of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> population not to give up the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> That resistance, of course, stands smack in the way of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan for a settlement in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would relinquish at least part of the territory So, when he is back in his comfortable office on the seventh floor of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, tanned and rested after a golfing vacation, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> must decide how much energy to expend on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and, if he decides on a lot, what other world problems should be sidetracked. Tugging at his sleeve, too, is the U.S.-Soviet relationship, and whether the improvement that resulted from four summit meetings between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> summit meetings could carry over into the negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear weapons. There are a number of problems in verifying some of the more elusive variety of these destructive missiles, bombers and submarines that may defy solution. And yet many elements of a possible treaty are already in place. A big push by <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who put the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty over the top through regular meetings with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, might just carry the day.

<TEXT>
 Teachers throughout <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> continue to lead children in the Pledge of Allegiance each day, on the voluntary basis supported by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Every elementary school child has an opportunity to say the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag every day,'' Education Commissioner <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynolds </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has attempted to make <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 1977 veto of a state law requiring teachers to conduct the pledge into a campaign issue in their presidential contest. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in vetoing the bill, cited advisory legal opinions and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> precedents that making the pledge mandatory would be unconstitutional. He says he supports saying the pledge itself. <PERSON> Raynolds </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> schools observe that policy of encouraging the pledge on a voluntary basis. `` The law is clear -LRB- that -RRB- those teachers who do not wish to conduct it, or those students who do not wish to say it, are not compelled to do so,'' he said. But he added that such exceptions are `` very, very, very few, one or two perhaps in a school, in most cases.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has claimed that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was simply `` looking for a reason'' to refuse to sign the bill. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded this week that he recites the Pledge of Allegiance himself and would urge children to do so. His 1977 veto was based largely on an advisory opinion from the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The court said the bill before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that year, to amend a 1935 law requiring teachers to lead the pledge once a week, violated the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and religion. It also said the original law was unconstitutional. The amendment said: `` Each teacher at the commencement of the first class of each day in all grades in all public schools shall lead the class in a group recitation of the ` Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.''' Failure of a teacher over a period of two consecutive weeks `` to salute the flag and recite said pledge ..., or to cause the pupils under his charge so to do, shall be punished for every such period by a fine of not more than $ 5.'' At <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' request, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> studied the amendment and by a 5-2 vote issued an advisory opinion saying the entire law regarding the pledge violated teachers' First Amendment rights. The court cited a 1943 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Barnette </PERSON>, which held that requiring a student, under the threat of expulsion, to recite the pledge and salute the flag violated the student's First Amendment rights. The student, a member of the <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses, had objected on religious grounds. `` In our view, the rationale of the <PERSON> Barnette </PERSON> opinion applies as well to teachers as it does to students,'' the state court said. `` However commendable the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s interest may be in imbuing young people with patriotic feelings, that interest can only be implemented through a precise and narrowly drawn provision which achieves the basic purpose without compromising First Amendment rights,'' the justices said. Acting on the court's opinion, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, `` My oath of office, as does yours, requires me to uphold the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I can not sign any bill that violates the Constitution, as this bill has been declared to do.'' The Legislature overrode <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' veto, by votes of 201-27 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and 24-7 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill became law and remains on the books today. But then-state Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellotti </PERSON> issued an opinion in 1977 saying that because of the constitutional question, the law `` may not be enforced.'' `` So it has never been enforced, could n't be enforced,'' current Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in political speeches over the past week, has said he does n't believe the framers of the Constitution would have considered it a violation of anyone's constitutional rights to be required to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. `` I would have signed that bill'' and let the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> resolve the issue, he says on the campaign trail. But <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said, `` The question really was, OK, do you for political purposes make people go through the expense and the trouble of having to strike down a clearly unconstitutional law, or do you go with the highest court's decision? He -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- did the right thing.'' <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON>, a constitutional law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said courts in other states have ruled similarly to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> court. `` The confusion that I think is created about it ... is that many assume that if teachers have a right to kind of opt out of leading the class in the pledge, that therefore the Pledge of Allegiance will not be somehow an official part of the school day,'' <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON> said. `` But of course that's not what was at stake. It remains an official part of the school day. It is just a question of whether teachers, like students, have a right for reasons of religious conscience to be excused from taking part in it.''

 The controversy over whether <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> used family influence to secure a spot with the Vietnam-era National Guard dogged the Republican presidential ticket for a full week before finally fading in recent days. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Thursday he had answered questions `` for seven days now,'' and that the public was `` getting a little bit sick'' of the issue. He said it was time to focus on the differences between the two tickets. The guard questions arose immediately after the 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was named to the Republican ticket by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In his inaugural news conference, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked about his decision in May 1969 to seek a guard position instead of accepting a draft or volunteering for military service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Later, in the midst of a round of network television interviews, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked whether his prominent family pulled strings to get him into the guard. He joined just six days before he became eligible for the draft at the height of the Vietnam War. His answers were not always consistent, but last Friday his spokesman acknowledged that phone calls may have been made on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s behalf, and a former family employee acknowledged he had made one such call Thus began a controversy that occupied most of the vice presidential candidate's first week of candidacy. Millions of young American men sought alternatives to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> service in the late 1960s, but <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s effort raised eyebrows because of his pro-war stance then and his outspoken advocacy of a strong national defense now. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s decision to join the guard in preference to service in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> did n't sit well with everyone, even among the higher ranks of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` I must tell you, in my generation you knew who was in the Guard and who was in uniform fighting for their country,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in a Sunday television interview. `` So they're very sensitive about it _ they did n't have anybody they could call, they could n't influence anyone, say, ` I asked my parents.' Well, my father wore overalls, who's he going to influence?'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has run into scattered hecklers chanting `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s a chicken'' and bearing signs reading `` <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Boy </PERSON>,'' `` Dump Quayle'' and `` War Wimp.'' National Guard officials have repeatedly denied <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> received preferential treatment, insisting places were available in certain units, including <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s. `` We have found nothing anywhere in our files that would indicate any problem,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Cathi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. A retired major general in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> did acknowledge Tuesday he told subordinates to hold open a space for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> after retired Guard commander _ and <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON> employee _ called to recommend <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON>, who in 1969 was military support plans officer for the state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and later headed the state Guard, said he was contacted by retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, then managing editor of <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> had called and said he had a good man, and said he thought he'd make a good Guardsman,'' <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> said. `` That's when I went over to personnel `` They said they had a couple of spaces. I said hold one of them, there's a good guy coming over.'' <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON> on Wednesday cited General Order 25, which authorized officials to fill the headquarters detachment's 138 allotted places as of April 1, 1969. Guard records show no more than 134 men were enlisted during April, May _ the month <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined _ and June. `` We're not waving the flag here, but a lot of people are saying ` what's the big deal?''' <PERSON> Kiger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ahner </PERSON> notwithstanding, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> dismissed the issue Monday when he spoke at a Veterans of Foreign Wars meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, saying he did n't need his family's help to join the Guard. `` My <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> unit had openings before I applied, they had openings when I applied and they had openings after I applied. So there was absolutely no influence used,'' said the maternal grandson of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, who published newspapers in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> at the time <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> enlisted. Retired Col. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON>, who was director of personnel in 1969, said the then-22-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was a solid Guard candidate, but conceded the recommendations of high-ranking officers carried some weight. `` If ... any of the generals called me and said they knew a man who would make a good Guardsman, I'd prick my ears,'' he said, `` because they only sent the highest quality young man. That's the way the system worked.'' But <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON> maintained that, despite a certain amount of networking among officers, the service was fundamentally egalitarian. `` We recruited on the basis of the needs of the service _ not the individual,'' he said. The experience of a college dropout sworn in within three days of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> seemed to confirm <PERSON> Rafferty </PERSON>'s claims. Retired Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morell </PERSON> was able to complete processing in three days while there was a 22-day span between <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s initial testing and his enlistment <PERSON> Morell </PERSON>, now an unemployed truck driver, said he dropped out of college and walked into a local recruitment office. He enlisted as a clerk-typist and served side-by-side with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.

 The White House is warning that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to enact new spending programs for the coming fiscal year, lawmakers will have to find offsetting savings elsewhere or face unpopular, automatic budget cuts. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> projected Thursday that the fiscal 1989 federal deficit would come in just under the $ 146 billion target set in the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. Under that legislation, if the budget office determines that the red ink will exceed $ 146 billion, spending on defense and domestic programs must be slashed automatically by whatever amount is necessary to shrink the deficit to $ 136 billion. `` In that case, congressional overspending will trigger across-the-board cuts that slash high priority programs every bit as much as lower priority programs,'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where he is vacationing. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> estimated that, including programs enacted through Aug. 15, the fiscal 1989 deficit would be $ 144 billion. When figuring in programs signed into law over the last few days, the amount of red ink grew to $ 145.3 billion, just $ 700 million below the $ 146 billion budget-cut trigger. White House budget chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> noted that when lawmakers return from their summer recess next month, they plan to consider a collection of popular bills _ including hunger relief, anti-drug programs, welfare reform, child care and a minimum-wage increase _ that would boost the deficit beyond $ 146 billion. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told reporters that if those bills were enacted, lawmakers would have to find compensating savings elsewhere or face the automatic cuts, which are `` something I do n't think anybody in their right mind'' wants. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., said he believed spending would be kept under control `` It's clear that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president are going to have to walk a fiscal tightrope in the coming weeks, but I believe we can maintain our balance and avoid crippling, across-the-board cuts,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. Lawmakers are considered unlikely to set off the Gramm-Rudman process of spending cuts and risk the wrath of voters angry because their favorite programs have been slashed. On Aug. 19, the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimated the 1989 deficit at $ 153 billion, an amount that would trigger $ 17 billion in cuts. That projection, which serves only as a guideline for lawmakers, was based on more pessimistic economic assumptions than those used by the administration. Fiscal 1989 begins Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'s final, binding calculation of next year's projected deficit is due Oct. 15. The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> estimates the deficit for the current fiscal year at $ 152.3 billion.

<HEAD>Early Appointment of White House Science and Technology Adviser
Urged</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The next administration needs to exert stronger <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> science and technology policy, according to an appeal issued by organizations representing more than 750,000 scientists and engineers. In a letter to presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the heads of 23 scientific and engineering societies called for early appointment of a new <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> science and technology adviser who will have direct access to the president. They contended in the letter released Thursday that `` the most urgent problems confronting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the world today _ ranging from the destruction of the ozone layer and the ` greenhouse effect' to the spread of AIDS and the restoration of competitiveness of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry _ depend on the effective utilization of the nation's science and technology resources.'' `` Leadership in science and technology policy must come from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' they said, urging the candidates to devote `` careful thought'' to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> science and technology advisory structure. `` We believe that this structure must be strengthened and that the person selected to be the principal science and technology adviser should have direct access to the president,'' the letter said. It also urged that the appointment of a new science and technology adviser be made early, enabling the adviser to have a voice in filling sub-Cabinet level positions in federal agencies which deal with science and technology issues. Spokesmen for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigns said they had no immediate comment on the letter. The letter was released at a news conference during which <PERSON> Val </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was at a competitive disadvantage in the world economy because about three-quarters of federal research and development money goes to military programs. <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist from <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, called for a return to the `` halcyon days'' of the <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administrations, when <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> science advisers had enjoyed more frequent and direct access to the president. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We see the need for a much stronger, pro-active role on the part of government in building partnerships within the -LRB- science and engineering -RRB- community.'' `` From the engineering standpoint, we see an extremely important role for a vigorous science and technology adviser to the president, in bringing these issues to the president, being a spokesman in the councils of government, being an advocate when necessary,'' <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schachman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biology </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We believe that solutions to many of the world's most vexing problems will need to be sought through the biological and medical sciences in the next decade. `` The president must be given the detailed knowledge that will allow him to judge the validity and implications of the latest and best research,'' said <PERSON> Schachman </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official, has been serving as White House science adviser since June 1986. Prior to that, the post was vacant for a six-month period following the resignation of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyworth </PERSON> II in December 1985.

<HEAD>1989 Farm Income Prospects Down Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prospects for a hefty boost in the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports this year have continued to improve, but the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the outlook is not quite so bright for 1989. This fiscal year's export value is expected to jump 22 percent to a four-year high of $ 34 billion, up from $ 27.9 billion in 1986-87, the department said Thursday. Shipments were forecast at 146 million metric tons in the year that will end Sept. 30, up 13 percent from last year. Both the value and quantity estimates were up from the previous <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecasts on May 26 of $ 33.5 billion and 145.5 million tons. Although the report cited no figures for subsequent years, it said export values may increase in 1988-89 due to higher prices but the volume of shipments may decline. In another report last week, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the volume of 1989 wheat exports may drop 12 percent from this year; corn, 4 percent; and soybeans, 29 percent. Thursday's report said the rise in 1988 estimates since May stemmed from larger-than-expected exports of animal products, slightly larger subsidized wheat exports, and higher corn prices due to the drought. Noting that 1987-88 exports are now expected to be up $ 6.1 billion and 16.8 million tons, the report said, `` This largely reflects reduced competitor supplies; higher prices for grains, oilseeds and cotton; and increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export competitiveness'' helped by a lower-valued dollar and the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, selected countries _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ can get wheat and other designated commodities subsidized by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. The new forecast showed the value of grain exports at $ 12.2 billion, up from $ 11.8 billion expected in May and 1986-87 shipments worth $ 9.33 billion. Oilseeds, mainly soybeans, were forecast at $ 7.6 billion, down slightly from $ 7.7 billion indicated three months ago. But that was up from $ 6.47 billion last year. Exports of livestock products this year were raised to $ 4.7 billion from the May forecast of $ 4.5 billion. In 1986-87, those were valued at $ 3.96 billion. Other major categories included: horticultural products, $ 3.7 billion this year, the same as indicated in May but up from $ 3.15 billion in 1986-87. Cotton export values were shown at $ 2.2 billion, the same as the earlier forecast. Last year's cotton shipments were worth $ 1.43 billion.

 World cigarette production climbed 2.9 percent last year to 5.12 trillion cigarettes, or `` pieces,'' says an Agriculture Department analysis. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, accounting for 28 percent of the world cigarette production, continues to be the driving force behind this increase,'' the report said Thursday. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s output in 1987 increased 10 percent to 1.4 trillion pieces, registering double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year.'' Not including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, world output remained nearly unchanged at 1.43 trillion cigarettes, although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production rose 6 percent to 689.4 billion pieces. Other countries posting gains of 3 billion or more cigarettes in 1987 included the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` Increased production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> went towards expanded exports,'' the report said. `` Production increases in the remaining countries were generally in response to increased domestic consumption.'' But some countries showed significant production cuts last year. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> led the way as cigarette output declined 10 percent to 266.4 billion pieces, the report said. `` This reduction was a result of a dramatic increase in imports that reduced the market share of domestically produced cigarettes,'' the report said. Other countries showing reduced production in 1987 included <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> says a plan by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to change price support loan procedures should be withdrawn. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON>, president of the association, said Thursday that wheat growers strongly oppose <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Aug. 10 proposal `` to provide that 1987 and all subsequent crops of wheat, feed grains, rice and soybeans would be ineligible for an extension of the original 9-month loan.'' The support loans are made to farmers who then are required to repay the loans when due or forfeit the grain to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> It has been a common practice in periods of abundance to extend the loans, allowing the grain to be kept off the market longer and not depress prices. <PERSON> Johannsen </PERSON> said in a letter filed with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> that he recognized the market situation changed in 1988 because of the drought but that it does not justify prohibiting loan extensions on future crops. `` Decisions on future loan extensions should be made on a year-to-year basis and should be based on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks, production and projected domestic and world demand,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, the former soldier arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on suspicion of espionage, grew up as a shy but well-liked youth in Sebring, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, according to former high school classmates. `` He was shy, but when you would compliment him he would give you this sly smile that would catch your attention,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Igro </PERSON>, who was on the track team with <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> McKinley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> school where <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> graduated in 1965. <PERSON> Igro </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> flew home from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for their 1985 class reunion but `` there was just small talk, about old days in school, not about what he was doing now.'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waugaman </PERSON>, 41, who went through school with <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> and was the track team's manager during their senior year, said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> kept to himself. `` As far as I know, he pretty much stayed home,'' <PERSON> Waugaman </PERSON> said. `` I do n't even recall him ever dating much. He did n't associate with that many people.'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> enlisted in the Army on Aug. 9, 1965, and during his 20 years of active-duty service, worked as an infantryman and then as an `` administration specialist'' before retiring with an honorable discharge in September 1985 while serving with the 8th Infantry Division in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, service records show. He served in the Vietnam War from March 1966 to March 1967, but spent most of his career in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Army officials said Thursday they still were trying to determine what security clearances <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> held when he retired. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said his last job was listed as `` liaison non-commissioned officer,'' but said it would take at least until today to determine his specific responsibilities in that position. The Army released the bare service record for <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, born in August 1947, at the request of reporters but would not confirm he was the man arrested in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for allegedly leading an international spy ring that funneled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> secrets to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc for 10 years. However, West German authorities have identified the man arrested as a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier named <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said that under the Privacy Act, it could not discuss the ongoing espionage investigation. According to the service records, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> served with an unspecified unit in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from May 1967 to May 1970 and again from June 1971 to June 1974. In November 1974, he was assigned to the 8th Infantry Division's headquarters company, which is located in <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kreuznach </LOCATION> This appears to be the first assignment that <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> drew with a headquarters detachment where sensitive documents would assuredly be stored. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> served in that post until August 1979. The next month, he was transferred to the 3rd Battalion of the 17th Infantry at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he remained until March 1980.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> failed again today to clear the way for full-scale talks on sharing the Olympics and on a non-aggression pact and said they will not meet again until after the Games. The two sides, after more than three hours of discussion, failed to resolve any outstanding issues. The South proposed they meet again in October after the Olympics. The North proposed a meeting Oct. 13, which was accepted by the South. The decision not to meet until October appeared to indicate the two sides had given up on efforts to work out an agreement on the Olympics, which end Oct. 2. But South Korean officials would not rule out a last-minute bid to try to get the North to participate in the Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The five-member delegations of lawmakers from each side smiled and shook hands as the meeting opened in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> building at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce village, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The site straddles the Demilitarized Zone, the neutral DMZ which divides the two Koreas. Chief delegate Park Joon-kyu of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> urged the communist North to agree to hold parliamentary talks in the North's capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> next Monday to resolve the Olympic question. He noted that the Olympic flame was due to arrive in the South on Saturday and time was running out before the Games begin on Sept. 17 `` The attention of the entire world is now focused on the question of whether the grand festival of national reconciliation... will be held or not,'' he said The chief North Korean delegate, <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, said talks should be held as soon as possible, but still insisted that a non-aggression pact should top the agenda. He said full-scale talks should also stress the Olympics. <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> said the dispute over the North's call for representatives of social and other groups taking part in the parliamentary talks could be put aside and settled at the actual talks. But he held fast that the full parliaments of both sides take part in the negotiations. The talks began Aug. 19, ended in stalemate Monday and resumed Friday only because their top delegates met Wednesday. South Korean officials said Thursday the negotiations would bog down unless <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> changes its `` unrealistic'' positions. `` It is up to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. We have done enough and nothing more to give,'' said one source close to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> delegation, who asked not to be identified. The two sides differ widely over an agenda and the size of the parliamentary talks. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is demanding a meeting of the full legislatures of both sides, involving nearly 1,000 members, plus dozens of representatives of all walks of life. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is seeking a smaller meeting of up to 30 delegates from each side, saying that a large group can not effectively tackle sensitive issues. Also in dispute is a North Korean demand that the two legislatures publish a joint declaration of non-aggression, calling for the withdrawal of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> considers the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence essential to its defense. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called for urgent talks on sharing the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics, but South Korean officials said it seemed more concerned about issuing a joint declaration of non-aggression South Korean officials say there is virtually no hope for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to take part in the Olympics. They say <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is trying to keep the current talks alive as long as possible to distract world attention from the Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Olympics unless it is made a co-host. The International Olympic Committee has rejected the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> demand, saying that the Olympics are awarded to a single city and can not be shared. The Korean peninsula was divided into communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and capitalist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, which left more than a million people dead.

 Authorities in five countries and two continents have cracked a drug smuggling ring based in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, arresting 76 people and seizing 230 pounds of cocaine, officials said. Police said Thursday the cocaine is worth nearly $ 15 million.

He said the last arrests came Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, where police arrested two Uruguayans and seized 13.2 pounds of cocaine. <PERSON> Muntoni </PERSON> said the investigation used telephone taps, surveillance and the monitoring of bank accounts.

<HEAD>Couple Charged With Conning Victims with Hard-Luck Stories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A couple whose hard-luck stories of broken-down cars and helpless pregnancy squeezed up to $ 200 an hour from parking-lot Good Samaritans were actually apartment managers who moonlighted as con artists, authorities said. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartland </PERSON>, 24, described as aspiring actors, were each charged with 22 misdemeanor counts of petty theft for allegedly duping people in the scheme that netted them up to $ 200 an hour, the City Attorney's office said Thursday. Among the alleged victims was <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times writer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, whose column recounting his suspicion and eventual surrender of $ 20 during an encounter with the seemingly forlorn couple brought at least 50 letters from readers who said they had been similarly taken in. The couple, who have been dubbed the `` Yuppie Panhandlers'' by authorities, are scheduled for a <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> arraignment Sept. 1. City Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said the couple approached people in supermarket parking lots and at service stations and told elaborate hard luck stories, asking for a loan which they promised to pay back. The letters to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> were turned over to police, and <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said they provided the leads needed to identify the couple. `` I'm pretty soft-hearted and I was skeptical throughout because there were some holes in their story. But then you wonder, ` What if it's true,''' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was approached by the couple outside a <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> supermarket in April. `` I hate to think I looked gullible. When I thought about it, I said: ` What a dumbbell you are,' `` <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> added. He said he has since talked to the woman, who apologized. <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartland </PERSON>, who were arrested Aug. 10 while making their pitch to a man at a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> car wash, were not at all down on their luck, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. They were being paid for managing a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> apartment building and also received a free $ 776-a-month apartment as part of the deal, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. He added that <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> admitted making about $ 200 an hour on the con game which had been running for three years. Both <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hartland </PERSON> have arrest records on drug related charges, and <PERSON> Hartland </PERSON> has a shoplifting case pending, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. Explaining how the scheme worked, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said the woman often would sit in a car cuddling a dog or cat while <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> approached the victims. `` Allman would spin elaborate tales of woe and misfortune about how their car had broken down and they had spent all their money to get it repaired, or about how the car had been burglarized and all their cash stolen,'' he said. `` One victim remembered how Allman dropped imploringly to one knee during his pitch to her,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said, noting they would get the name and address of each victim and promise to return the money. Often, the woman appeared to be pregnant, he said, and when the couple left with between $ 10 and $ 100 they would wave at their victims and say, `` God bless you.'' `` That woman has been two months pregnant for two years,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> quipped. Those who helped the couple often went out of their way to do so, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. A minister drove with the couple for 20 minutes in search of a store which would cash a check so he could give them $ 53 in food and cash. An elderly man took the couple home with him, fed them and gave them $ 100 to help them get home to <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>, where they said they lived, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. Neither Allman or Hartland is listed in area telephone directories, and they could not be reached for comment. The maximum sentence for each charge is six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said he also will seek restitution for all victims.

<HEAD>U.S. to Review Duty-Free Rights of Israel, Five Other Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is reviewing the duty-free export privileges of six countries that have been accused of abusing workers' rights, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The six countries, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, have been targeted in an annual review under the Generalized System of Preference or GSP program that allows `` developing'' nations to export products to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> free of charge, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> GSP </ORGANIZATION> beneficiary countries must comply with international trade union laws, and <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s decision to review the six countries was based on petitions from labor unions, human rights and lobbying groups. Last June the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> complained that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was denying trade union protection to more than 100,000 Palestinians who travel daily from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The other countries to be reviewed are <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> filed the petitions against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> complained about <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and an international lawyers group submitted the petition against <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>. `` My decision to accept or reject these petitions was made after careful and deliberate consideration,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in a statement. He added that `` the acceptance of these petitions does not prejudge our final determination.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> rejected petitions to review the <ORGANIZATION> GSP </ORGANIZATION> rights of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. If the countries lose their duty-free privileges <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which in 1987 exported $ 487 million worth of goods under the <ORGANIZATION> GSP </ORGANIZATION> program, would lose the most. A free-trade agreement between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already exempts some Israeli exports from duty, but that 1986 pact is being phased in over a 10-year period and still does not cover hundreds of items. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> also stands to lose, having exported $ 347 million in goods under terms of the <ORGANIZATION> GSP </ORGANIZATION>, while the others exported far smaller amounts. Currently, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> grants duty-free treatment to about 3,000 products from 136 countries. According to government figures, since the program's inception in 1976, the value of <ORGANIZATION> GSP </ORGANIZATION> duty-free imports has grown to $ 16.3 billion. Three days of public hearings will be held starting Oct. 3 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the case, and investigations will be conducted in the targeted countries. The trade representative's final determination will be announced on April 1, 1989.

<TEXT>
 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says the booing he heard from the Veterans of Foreign Wars does n't mean he failed to get across his message that Democrats are strong on defense issues. `` I tried in a dispassionate way to set the record straight. And they'll remember that,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. In his speech Thursday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> before the VFW, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator called Republican attempts at painting the Democrats as weak and unpatriotic `` scurrilous.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to reinforce his defense message today with a visit to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and appearances with <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, the Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a decorated World War II bomber pilot, was greeted with a standing ovation from the VFW. But he was interrupted four times by boos and jeers from the crowd _ three times when he talked about Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and once when he mentioned former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` It got my adrenalin up,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters later. `` I've done enough campaigning that I know you're going to have some of those along the way,'' he said of the unfriendly reception by some in the audience He said he was not surprised by the negative reaction to his mention of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying, `` In part, you saw orchestrated response by some who were quite partisan.'' But the loud boos that greeted <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s assertion that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> started the recent defense buildup `` surprised me,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> toward the end of his term began to appreciate ... that our defense forces had deteriorated. He turned that around,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` That's not generally remembered and they really did n't want to remember that.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, wearing his VFW cap, asked the veterans to consider <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, also a veteran, as someone they could rely on to keep the nation protected. He recited a list of defense programs supported by the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, including the cruise missile, the stealth bomber and a new conventional weapons initiative. `` The simple truth is this: Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a veteran, a patriot, and an advocate of American strength and steadiness,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the VFW. `` He can be trusted as a defender of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> security and as a champion of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values.'' The VFW supported <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1984 and warmly greeted Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, on Monday. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was finishing up his campaign swing this week in the deep South, after spending most of the first three days in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Besides visiting <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, he was scheduled to address a state Democratic meeting in <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, Ark. today. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> originally had been scheduled to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tonight, but instead, he was heading back to his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was campaigning in the state, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he wanted to respond to that.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was catching up on state business today, back home after two days of wooing support in key industrial states with his harshest attacks to date on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor planned to spend most of today in his office, emerging only to swear in a new member of the state authority which oversees <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The Democratic presidential nominee arrived home Thursday night and attended a fund-raising event after campaigning in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He also returned with the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, which he accepted Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before heading out to campaign in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> already had been to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> since accepting the nomination, and his return visits accentuated his campaign's determination to secure a Democratic base in industrial states. He toured a steel mill outside <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on Thursday before addressing an evening rally, telling both reporters and the rally that economic growth during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years has left the average American family behind. `` Opportunity for some is n't the goal we set for ourselves in this <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And maintaining the status quo _ running in place, standing still, is n't the future we want for our country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee, for not telling the Republican National Convention last week how he would erase the deficit. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Thursday night, about 150 gay rights activists demonstrated outside <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fund-raising event to criticize a state policy they say virtually bans placement of foster children in gay and lesbian homes. There were no arrests, and by the time <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, arrived, only a handful remained, chanting, `` Hey, hey, ho, ho, homophobia's got to go.'' `` We want <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters to know that he's anti-gay,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mass Act Out, a gay rights group that sponsored the protest with the Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign official at the scene refused comment. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered his sharpest attack to date on Reagan-Bush drug policies, accusing the president and vice president of failing miserably in the war on drugs. `` Today, after seven years of tough talk, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want some answers,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told an audience. `` Why, after seven years of task forces and policy boards and grandiose claims, have cocaine imports tripled, drug-related deaths doubled, and heroin imports risen by 50 percent?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for supporting spending billions of dollars on the Star Wars space-defense plan at a time when the administration has cut federal aid to state and local drug programs by two-thirds. `` The drug cancer is eating away at the foundation of fragile democracies throughout this hemisphere,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's corrupting governments, destroying economies, ravaging communities, spawning terror and crippling lives. He also blamed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a litany of drug-related problems in the nation. `` Now the vice president says that if elected, he'll put his vice president in charge of the war against drugs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried that. It did n't work.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stepped up his criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for dealing with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, saying for the first time that he considered the administration's conduct criminal. `` For years, while General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was actively involved in the drug business, we were actively in business with General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` My friends, that's criminal.'' If elected, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to sign an executive order prohibiting the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other federal agencies from making payments to suspected drug traffickers except during undercover investigations. After spending today at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Saturday to be with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and other civil rights leaders to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the March on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> led by the late <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. He was to spend the weekend relaxing in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prior to a gubernatorial trip to the region Monday and Tuesday.

 They twisted, coffee-grinded and jitterbugged their way into the nation's living rooms on the original `` American Bandstand'' in the 1950s. Now, older and a little less svelte, they're back in the city where it all began to recapture their glory days. On Thursday, for the first time in a quarter century, 27 of the original Bandstand dancers, including <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>, reunited to rehearse their steps for a rock' n' roll celebration over Labor Day weekend in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> `` Any place there's dancing, I'll still go,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON>, who was 15 when he joined the show. <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON>, now 46, of south <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lis </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> of the Hot Foot Agency, a talent agency for dancers, cooked up the idea of bringing the gang together to dance, gossip and reminisce at the rock' n' roll event, called Rock ` A' <PERSON> Rama </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON> developed the two-hour show with <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>, contacted the dancers and helped with the choreography. `` American Bandstand'' started life as a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> TV show in 1952, with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> as master of ceremonies. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> took over as host in 1956, and the show made its network debut on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 5, 1957. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> moved the show to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1964, but many fans remember it as a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> phenomenon. The Bandstanders invented steps that are still given a whirl: the bunny hop, the chalypso and the stroll. `` You were like a big star. Girls chased ya; the guys hated ya,'' said <PERSON> Fusco </PERSON>. So in a dance studio Thursday night, remembering the glory days, they practiced their jitterbugs and coffee-grinding and listened to <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Darin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Avalon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedaka </PERSON>. The dancers have aged, some have gained weight or grown mustaches, but they continue to follow what's hip in fashion and dance steps. Several wore miniskirts, others donned sneakers and pedal pushers. During breaks, they grabbed cameras and cigarettes and tried to catch up with each others' lives before <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> called them back for another try at `` Rock Around the Clock'' or `` Oh, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>.'' The reunion gossip even included a love story. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Scaldeferri </PERSON>, a regular on the show from 1957 to 1961, met <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spada </PERSON> in 1957, when he was a fan who traveled to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to see the show in person. In 1977, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> appeared on a <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> television special, where <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> spotted her. With the help of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> contacted <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> and the two were married six months later. `` Now I only dance at weddings,'' said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>, 42. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Baritz </PERSON>, a little out of breath from a fast jitterbug, said he now runs a food and gift shop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said fans often spot the `` American Bandstand'' display in his store and gawk at photographs of their favorite Bandstanders. Recalling the days when a secretary handled her fan mail, <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said, `` They still remember, they still remember.'' And they do. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frees </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ephrata </LOCATION> is president and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bandstand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which has more than 800 members in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` You better believe I'll be there,'' Frees said of the Rock ` A' Rama appearance There are no plans to televise the event. And it was Frees, not any of the original Bandstanders interviewed Thursday, who remembered the words to the show's theme song, written by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Manilow </PERSON>. `` I'll jump and, hey, I may even show'em my handstand, because I'm on the American Bandstand.''

<TEXT>
 A retired couple returned from a two-month vacation to find their fashionable <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment had been looted of more than $ 750,000 in art and jewels, including works by <PERSON> Renoir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chagall </PERSON>. `` As soon as I opened the door, there was an emptiness,'' <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, 88, said Thursday. She and her husband, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON>, a retired jewelry importer and manufacturer, had been away since June and discovered the burglary upon returning Wednesday night to their home, said a police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. Among the things missing were sculptures, paintings, carpets and silverware, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. `` How in the world could they have walked out with all this?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said. It was not known how the burglar got into the 16th-floor apartment, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said, noting that there was no sign of forced entry. Police had no suspects. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said Thursday that the burglars took the most valuable works, leaving behind those by lesser-known artists. `` I think they must have been here for days,'' he said. `` They went over everything very carefully.'' The missing items had been insured for their 1983 value of between $ 500,000 and $ 750,000, but were worth more than that now, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Nude Models Need More Social Support, Daily Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nude models are unfair victims of popular disapproval, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> newspaper said today in an appeal for an improvement in models' social status. The Guangming Daily said a survey of nude female models in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> revealed they are subject to social scorn and often have difficulty finding boyfriends or husbands. Some complained that even at the art institutes where they work, teachers and students regard them as sexually `` liberated, modern women.'' The newspaper, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading daily for intellectuals, said one model was arrested and fined $ 27 after getting into a fight after she was insulted. The report did not mention male models. The women seldom earn more than $ 55 a month. That's about double what a factory worker makes, but the models have no medical benefits and often ca n't afford a doctor when they catch colds, the report said. Few buildings in <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> are heated, despite temperatures below freezing in the winter. In February, another Chinese daily reported a 19-year-old girl suffered a nervous breakdown because of the abuse she received for posing nude at the <ORGANIZATION> Nanking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. The Guangming Daily said artistic studies of the human body go back thousands of years, but it said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is less receptive to nudity in art because of its feudal history and long periods of isolation. `` All society should give them more understanding and more respect,'' it said. The nude has played a relatively minor role in Chinese art history, and the prim Communist government that came to power in 1949 effectively banned all nude paintings. But nude modeling for art schools was revived around 1984, and the government has since given cautious approval to art shows featuring nude paintings. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> last month opened an exhibition of paintings and sculptures devoted to studies of the human body.

<HEAD>Bush Campaign To Change Press Plane Following Mishaps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign agreed to drop a charter air carrier after media representatives refused to fly on it due to safety concerns. Campaign officials arranged to meet today with Key Air officials to negotiate termination of the $ 1.8 million contract, said campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>. She said the campaign would enter discussions with other potential carriers and use a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> charter in the meantime. The decision came after a series of mishaps in the past week involving the Key charter that carries the traveling press corps. `` The press corps wants to terminate the contract,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON>, noting that news organizations are charged to cover the cost of the charter. `` The charter belongs to the press corps and we are trying to meet their needs. They have a job to do and we aim to meet their needs,'' she said. Terms of the settlement remained to be worked out, she said, but added that Key oficials `` did not want to be an obstacle in any way.'' After some in the press refused to fly a Key plane earlier in the week, the campaign already had switched to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> for a Thursday trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. But that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-300 aircraft was grounded for the day by an engine that overheated on takeoff from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a small pool of reporters aboard Air Force Two went on to his event in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> while the rest of the press corps was left behind. The earlier incidents occurred Saturday when fumes and smoke entered the cabin as the Key Boeing 727 was landing in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and Monday, when the same plane's wing flaps did not retract as it was taking off from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The plane dumped fuel into <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and returned to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Key's president, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, came to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Thursday to meet with members of the traveling press and campaign staff, but his assurances did not change the minds of those worried about the aircraft's safety. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has about 60 to 70 reporters, photographers, camera crews and producers traveling with him as he campaigns for the presidency.

<HEAD>CDC Recommends Ways To Handling `Cluster' Suicides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communities should be prepared ahead of time in case they are struck by multiple suicides, since there is `` extremely compelling'' evidence that one can lead to another, the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> says. `` The middle of a crisis is no time to work out who's supposed to be doing what,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> specialist in suicide research. Being prepared is one of 10 recommendations the federal agency issued Thursday to help communities deal with `` clusters'' of suicides. The recommendations stem from a conference held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> late last year to enable communities that have not seen outbreaks of suicide to learn from those that have. On March 11, 1987, four <LOCATION> Bergenfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, teen-agers killed themselves in a garage in an apparent death pact. Within six days, four more teen-agers were dead in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs, and officials said those suicides probably were triggered by reports of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> deaths. Rule No. 1 in the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommendations: Be ready to take action. `` When the problem does arise with suicide clusters, there is usually a great deal of confusion,'' <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. `` This confusion can lead to different sectors of the community working at cross purposes.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said public and mental health agencies, schools, government, police, suicide hotlines and even the news media should cooperate in advance to make plans for their community. Then, if a suicide cluster appears to be developing, the community should work together to cope with its grief while watching other troubled youths to prevent further deaths, the report said. Though there are as yet no definitive studies of suicide-prevention approaches, `` I would never advocate doing nothing,'' <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> said. He said there is `` extremely compelling'' evidence that suicides can trigger more suicides. Only about 5 percent of the 5,000 teen suicides a year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are believed to be part of `` clusters,'' <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> said, but those clusters present the best opportunity for action. The response to suicide in a community `` has got to be gauged according to the situation,'' <PERSON> O'Carroll </PERSON> said. For example, the suicide of a student at home during a weekend would not call for `` some kind of enormous SWAT-team approach'' in school Monday morning, he said. In that case, quiet discussion would be in order. But if three or four suicides occur in a matter of days, `` and the community is going crazy, in that situation you will do far more harm than good by trying to play it low-key,'' he said. Among other <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommendations: _ Avoid glorifying the victims and their deaths, and minimize sensationalism _ Identify those at high risk and refer them to counseling _ Arrange for timely and accurate information flow to news media _ Identify elements that might increase suicide attempts and alter them; i.e., block off places where suicide attempts are taking place

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Airbus A320 jet that suffered mechanical problems on its inaugural flight in April returned to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> after warning lights indicated a fire on board, landing gear problems, and a computer failure, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Air France Flight 914, bound for <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> with 81 passengers, took off Thursday from <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaulle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> about 4 p.m. and a few minutes later, warning lights indicated failure of the plane's computers, the spokesman said The A320 is equipped with a `` fly-by-wire'' system that controls the plane's engines through computers rather than cables. A second set of lights indicating a fire in the toilet also illuminated without apparent cause, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with company policy. As the plane prepared to land, more lights flashed, warning that the landing gear failed. The pilot made a pass over the airport and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> technicians visually confirmed that the landing gear was in place. The plane landed without further incident, the spokesman said. The passengers went on to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> aboard other flights. The plane, the `` <LOCATION> Ville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' was the first of the sophisticated A320s to be delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> after the plane was certified for flight on Feb. 26. The same plane was delayed because of mechanical problems on its inaugural flight over <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in April with then-Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> on board. The half-hour delay led to discussions in the French press about the wisdom of letting the premier fly on the new aircraft. In June, three passengers were killed when an A320 crashed during a low-altitude demonstration flight before thousands of people at an air show in eastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. An investigation is under way into the cause of the accident. Developed over four years at a cost of nearly $ 2 billion, the A320 has been touted by the European consortium <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> as the fastest-selling plane in aircraft history. <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> has received more than 500 orders or letters of intent to purchase the plane from 21 countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

The lightning-sparked Walker Mountain fire in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> sent flames 100 feet into the sky less than a mile from a subdivision outside Grants Pass, prompting the order from state officials late Thursday that evacuation plans be readied for the subdivision. `` There are ashes falling just like rain on our deck,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, who lives at the Grants Pass city limits, about two miles south of the 1,200-acre fire. She said 400-500 people live in the subdivision. In eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a 5,000-acre fire caused evacuation plans to be readied for the tiny community of Troy near the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> line. <PERSON> Effie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said Troy is a `` motel and a restaurant'' with about 50 residents scattered nearby. Crews in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> began hosing down the 600 cabins and other buildings at the Canyon area, one of the largest developments in the nation's oldest national park, as flames became visible from the area. Firefighters also began unrolling water lines on roofs for sprinkler systems to bolster protection. By late afternoon, firefighters had drawn the flames away from Canyon and back toward the main section of the big North Fork fire by setting backfires, Fire Information Officer <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Downing </PERSON> said. While there was no immediate threat to structures at Canyon, officials wo n't know if the area is out of danger before Sunday, she said. Two other fires _ the 162,000-acre Clover-Mist fire on the park's eastern side and a 88,326-acre in the park's southern end _ burned but threatened no buildings. Ash and smoke from the fires reduced visibility significantly in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and brought haze and brightly colored sunsets to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. To the south of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> in Grand Teton National Park and the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, fire managers chose to herd a 15,569-acre blaze north toward <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, hoping it would run out of fuel when it merged with other blazes. Elsewhere in the West, fire crews struggled with blazes in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, all roads into the Canyon area were closed and heavy smoke obscured the sun and reduced visibility to less than 200 yards. With the park's south entrance already closed, only three entrances now remain open. Park officials evacuated 361 visitors from Canyon on Tuesday, moving them to other park lodgings. A fire erupted over 2,500 acres of a mining area in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, forcing evacuations at one mine, destroying a house and two bulldozers and threatening a 500-kilovolt power line feeding power to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, officials said. In southern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, firefighters battling a pair of major wilderness forest fires that burned close to 60,000 acres braced for a hot afternoon with gusting winds. A lightning storm moved toward the <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> area, where fire crews hoped to contain a 37,600-acre blaze to the southeast, while a 1,300-acre fire in central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> moved away from a Minuteman missile silo. That fire broke out Wednesday afternoon and more than doubled to 900 acres overnight, but <PERSON> Zail </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, said, `` The missile silo is completely secure.'' Oregon State Fire Marshal <PERSON> Olin </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> issued a statewide ban on outdoor burning, with the exception of approved field burning, a day after Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> declared a state of emergency in southwest <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, where three major fires charred 2,600 acres and destroyed a rural house. A 2,000-acre fire burned north of <LOCATION> Wallowa </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> part of the state. The declaration cleared the way for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to help fight the fires, but no troops were called out. The fires in southwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> started with a series of lightning storms Tuesday night; at least 60 fires, most of them small, were reported. In western <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, flames from the raging 2,450-acre Eagle Bar fire near <LOCATION> Hells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> spotted into the middle of a valuable commercial stand of timber, forcing fire bosses to divert at least one helicopter to try to contain the new blaze. Four other major blazes were burning on over 4,000 acres in the state. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, firefighters battled two large fires covering more than 750 acres southwest of <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> and a 200-acre lightning-sparked fire threatened about 15 homes near the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> border. More than 20 small new fires blazed up around the state. Firefighters in eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> expected to contain a 200-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> 26 miles north of <LOCATION> Vernal </LOCATION> and a separate 350-acre fire in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, according to fire management officer <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Erskin </PERSON>. Officials blamed a spark from a bulldozer for starting a 150-acre fire in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> at the Powder Mountain Ski Area. Near <LOCATION> Cloverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 65 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a grass fire set off by a welder's torch burned a barn where the welder was working and charred some 1,200 acres in steep terrain.

<HEAD>DeSillers Spared Jail; Lawyer Says She's Unfairly Maligned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> is an unfairly maligned woman who handled donations for her dying son as best she could, according to the lawyer who successfully battled contempt motions that could have put her in jail. The court-appointed curator for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' estate sought a contempt ruling because Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has refused to hand over financial records and items allegedly bought with some of the $ 690,000 in donations for the boy. But Dade Probate Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> dismissed the contempt motions Thursday, saying that if Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> gave up the records they might `` incriminate her'' in criminal probes under way in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> counties. `` I'm very happy,'' said Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>, who while awaiting the ruling gave her age as `` 33, the same as <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> when he was crucified.'' Curator <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, appointed by <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> in March after Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' handling of the donations was questioned, contends that about $ 200,000 may have been misspent on such purchases as a used BMW worth $ 13,500, a diamond-and-sapphire ring, a diamond-studded gold cross, clothing, furniture and 18 gravesites. Lawyers for Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> had no comment after <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s terse ruling but later requested an emergency hearing today on their requests to seize disputed belongings of Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>. Also, they want the judge to strike her $ 150,000 claim on her son's estate, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, another of her attorneys. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> argued during the two-day hearing that Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> enjoyed a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and should n't have to give up financial records or the disputed purchases. He also said some of the donations were expressly for his client's personal expenses. `` I'm not saying people gave it for <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> to buy jewelry. If she bought a pickup truck for $ 20,000, which is what they cost today, nobody would have criticized her,'' he told the judge. `` You'd think this was ` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.' This is not a woman who deserves to be humiliated,'' said <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, adding that his client was unfairly portrayed as `` greedy and grasping'' when she gave thousands of dollars to poor families with sick children. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>, 7, died in April 1987 at Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> while awaiting his fourth liver transplant. His plight made national news after $ 4,000 raised by his classmates for the operation was stolen from a school closet. Among the donations was $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and $ 200,000 from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> industrialist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. About a third of the donations remain, frozen in the boy's estate. Shortly before the ruling, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' former fiance, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, was handcuffed and whisked away as he stepped out of the courtroom where he had sat supportively behind Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> hocked two <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computers, monitors and printers worth $ 4,000 at a <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> pawn shop, <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION>'s, which he and Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> have often used in the past, said <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> Detective <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garafola </PERSON>. One of the computer sets had been stolen in a March robbery, and the other has not been traced. As he was led away, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> termed `` ridiculous'' charges of grand theft and another of dealing in stolen property. Detectives could not say if Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was involved. Her handling of the money came under question when the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital sued for the $ 262,000 balance of the boy's bill She refuses to pay, claiming <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> received improper care there, a charge the hospital denies.

 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is recalling more than 600,000 1983 Oldsmobiles and Buicks to replace an emissions control component that may have stopped working. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday a defective thermal vacuum switch causes the cars to exceed federal standards on emission of gasoline vapors and carbon monoxide.

<TEXT>
 The city today mourned the loss of its historic <LOCATION> Chiado </LOCATION> district, devastated by flames that raged out of control while firefighters were hampered by narrow cobblestone streets and low water pressure. Cultural landmarks in the 10-block area were reduced to smoldering ruins in the blaze that broke out before dawn Thursday in a 19th century department store and caused bottles of butane gas to explode. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Grandela and the <ORGANIZATION> Grandes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Chiado, the city's only department stores, were destroyed as were the Costa e <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> speciality grocery, the <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> china shop and the 350-year-old <PERSON> Casa </PERSON> <PERSON> Batalha </PERSON> button store. The stores were among the oldest in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and their wooden floors, staircases and cashier booths dated from the late 19th century when the stores were built to cater to the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> capital's emerging middle class. Neither was fitted with a sprinkler system and firefighters complained about low water pressure. Civil defense officials said a 60-year-old man died when flames engulfed his apartment and that 43 other people, most of them firefighters, were hospitalized for burns and smoke inhalation. Hundreds were evacuated. The fire destroyed the offices of many lawyers and accountants who scurried down the slippery streets carrying files and documents. They were joined by fleeing residents carrying cats, dogs and caged parakeets. Firefighters did not arrive at the scene until an hour after the fire was reported about 3 a.m. by a watchman at the 19th-century elevator built by <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiffel </PERSON> to connect the Chiado to streets in the area below. Fire equipment for the district had been called out to another, minor fire and became stuck in the narrow streets. The Chiado was a favorite haunt of Portuguese writers and musicians with its cafes and shops selling fine leather gloves, buttons, books and records. Its destruction was described by newspapers as the worst disaster to strike the capital since an earthquake and fire in 1755. Much of the Chiado was created when the <PERSON> Marques </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pombal </PERSON> rebuilt <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> after the quake. The cause of the blaze was under investigation. Police on Wednesday questioned <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> <PERSON> Dias </PERSON>, principal shareholder in the group that owns The <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Grandela, the three-story department store where the blaze broke out, about a mysterious fire in another store owned by the group. Seen from the air late Thursday afternoon through a cloud of dense smoke, the walls of the burned-out buildings stood like the ruins of war in the midst of a sunny, red-roofed city. `` <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> is poorer because of this catastrophe,'' President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> told reporters day as the fire roared through 150-year-old buildings behind him. Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> on a tour of the fire scene. <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON>, an economist by training, said the city will have to make `` a major effort'' to rebuild the area and create employment for the estimated 2,000 people who lost their jobs. Fire department Maj. <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Matos </PERSON> <PERSON> Silveira </PERSON> said the fire could smolder for several more days because of the wooden structures in the buildings and the highly combustible materials in the shops. Hundreds of volunteer firefighters from towns and industrial suburbs outside <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> poured into the city to help fight the blaze as crowds of people gathered in the central Rossio Square to watch.

<HEAD>Romania's Top Chess Player Asks Asylum, Says Romanian Officials
Harassed Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s top chess player says he has asked for political asylum, contending Romanian officials harassed him after he refused to play a tournament in a city he says is contaminated with radioactive waste. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Federation wanted to force me to do things which were against the interests of my health and my family,'' <PERSON> Mihai </PERSON> <PERSON> Suba </PERSON> told a Thursday news conference in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> capital, where he is playing a tournament. `` They tried to get to this point by blackmail, by threatening me.'' `` It's not a pleasure,'' the 41-year-old chess grandmaster said of his defection. He has also asked for asylum for his 14-year-old son <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, who is accompanying him. `` It's a necessity. It was unavoidable. I think it was the last opportunity, at least with somebody of my family,'' he said. His wife, <PERSON> Sanda </PERSON>, 39, and a 9-year-old son, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON>, remain in the Romanian capital of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. He said he hoped his wife would eventually be able to join him in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He said Romanian authorities tried to punish him because he refused to compete in a tournament in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Eforia </LOCATION>. He claimed the area was contaminated with major radioactive deposits that threatened the health of the inhabitants. <PERSON> Suba </PERSON> also complained that the results of school examinations his elder son took were lowered to help the children of highly placed officials. `` I was very upset about this,'' he said. <PERSON> Suba </PERSON> told reporters he contacted the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingdom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization that helps would-be immigrants, on Tuesday and mailed an application to the Home Office, which is in charge of immigration. A Home Office spokesman refused to confirm whether the <PERSON> Subas </PERSON> applied to defect to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Suba is ranked 78th in the chess world. His decision to defect did n't interfere with his play at the <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Masters </ORGANIZATION> tournament. He was leading the 100 players in the tournament after five rounds on Wednesday, but a loss in the sixth round on Thursday hurt his chances of picking up the $ 2,125 first prize. Soviet <PERSON> Vassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyslov </PERSON>, a former world champion, was among those competing. The Romanian grandmaster is the latest addition to a list of celebrated Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European chess players who have sought asylum in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. They include <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Korchnoi </PERSON>, who now lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and Lev Alburt, the 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> champion who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suba </PERSON>, who holds a masters degree in mathematics, said he would support himself by winning chess prizes and looking for a job in mathematics or computers.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is using poison gas to flush out South African-backed Angolan guerrillas from their rural strongholds, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> expert quoted in a British defense publication. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Defense weekly quoted <PERSON> Aubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyndrickx </PERSON>, head of toxicology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ghent </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> expert on biological and chemical warfare, as saying evidence based on environmental samples shows <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is using the lethal mixture of mustard gas and nerve gases. Soil, leaf and water samples taken from Angolan battle zones in April showed clear traces of the gases, <PERSON> Heyndrickx </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> weekly is an authoritative publication dealing with military matters worldwide. The attack must have taken place in March or April, <PERSON> Heyndrickx </PERSON> was quoted as saying, because the nerve gases are extremely volatile and would not remain in the environment for longer than a few weeks.

 As Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a two-day campaign swing, the <ORGANIZATION> Press-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> in urging him to leave the ticket he shares with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Press-Telegram, in an editorial in today's editions, said allegations about the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's military record and his link to a female lobbyist who appeared nude in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> are distracting voters from the real issues in the election. `` If <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> remains on the Republican ticket, neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor the nation will be well served,'' the editorial said. The editorial went on: `` Even when the candidates talk about these issues, they are not heard. Media and public attention focuses on <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a handsome man with a short, undistinguished record in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and an intolerable burden as a candidate.'' The editorial called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> hypocritical for styling himself a hawk on defense issues when he spent the Vietnam War years writing press releases in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and imprudent for sharing a condominium on a golfing trip with two congressional colleagues and lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Town Feels Compassion For Family Known For Strange Ways</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 For years, a mother and three grown children in this small town were known as a strange brood: their furniture was upside down, they refused to use household plumbing and shouted at all hours of the night. But the odd habits of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 68, and her children generated only sympathy from townspeople, which deepened when utility workers found the decomposed body of Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>, in their house, officials said. `` I feel terrible about this whole situation,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, the police chief in this southeast <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> town of 8,000 people. `` To me, the outcome of this is the <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> family is going to be stuck in a mental institution.'' Officers on Wednesday arrested Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, her 38-year-old daughter <PERSON> Michella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michella </PERSON>'s twin brother <PERSON> John </PERSON>, police said. They were taken to a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> hospital for a medical evaluation ordered by <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> District Judge <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. The family's strange habits had grown stranger in the last two or three years, according to Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON>. In addition to the upside-down furniture, shouting and refusal to use plumbing, the house was falling apart and there was no glass in the windows. On Aug. 5, gas workers checking a meter at the house found 35-year-old <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s body in a bedroom after Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> asked them if they would like to see her daughter, officials said. The family had put Miss <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> to bed after she collapsed July 8, then rubbed her with lotions and flour in an attempt to heal her, authorities said. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> later said she did not realize her daughter had died until <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s body turned black. The woman died of natural causes, said <LOCATION> Whitley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, citing a preliminary autopsy report. The medical examination of the family was requested by Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, after he heard about his niece's death, said his attorney, <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>. For the people of <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, the order that the <PERSON> Moores </PERSON> be examined represents an emotional release, <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON> said. `` We have a community that would have helped, if they had been allowed,'' said the mayor. `` But they -LRB- the Moores -RRB- were unusually independent and would not accept aid by anybody.'' The family was considered harmless. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> used to listen to his portable radio while he picked up trash downtown and his sisters sat on a curb and watched. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michella </PERSON> were arrested as they walked to a grocery store, said police Lt. <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgan </PERSON>. They did not resist, but did not seem to know what was happening, she said. `` The mother started hollering, ` Do n't hurt my daughter,' and that was it,'' the lieutenant said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, arrested in woods behind his house, was handcuffed after he screamed, neighbors said. `` I liked to cried when I saw them put him in the police car,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, acting on an initial medical evaluation at the police department, ordered the <PERSON> Moores </PERSON> taken to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> nearly 80 miles to the north. Under state law, the hospital evaluation must be conducted within 72 hours. If it is determined the <PERSON> Moores </PERSON> need medical attention and can not care for themselves, they are entitled to a hearing and trial before commitment. City Manager <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Vermillion </PERSON> said committing the <PERSON> Moores </PERSON> would be in the family's best interest. `` I think we would have been criticized real hard if we had n't taken action,'' he said `` Suppose it happened again?'' But <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, who knew the <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> children growing up, said committing the family to a mental institution would be a `` real injustice.'' `` They may get properly clothed and properly fed,'' the police chief said. `` But are they going to be happy there? Separated? I do n't think so.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Go Back To Work After Opposition Walkout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers facing a Sept. 1 deadline for certifying a new <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> returned to work early today before an empty public gallery following a stormy debate that one legislator said was proof of democracy. Opposition legislators walked out just before dawn Thursday after a rowdy, all-night session of the chamber, sitting as an electoral college to certify results of the July 6 general election. When the meeting resumed, the public galleries were closed, although the press was allowed in. Opposition sympathizers earlier Thursday chanted, whistled, threw coins and other objects and rose to comment on what in the past have been staid sessions endorsing sweeping victories by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. `` Cuauhtemoc won!'' was a frequent chant. Presidential candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, the leader of a <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> movement </ORGANIZATION>, claims the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> cheated him of victory. His supporters form the biggest bloc of opposition legislators in the chamber, where the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> must now contend with the strongest opposition in nearly 60 years. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> delegation, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, said the unprecedented debate `` shows clearly that we are living within a democratic framework.'' The July 6 elections were tainted by widespread accusations that the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> tampered with voter registration rolls, stuffed ballot boxes and destroyed ballots for opposition candidates. Opposition leaders have accused the party of steamroller tactics to speed vote certification, especially in the chamber. `` We have to seek new ways -LRB- of protest -RRB- because the official party is legitimizing fraud more and more every day,'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyola </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday after 227 opposition delegates walked out, temporarily halting the chamber's work. He accused <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> delegates of rejecting all opposition requests to investigate fraud. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> denied the charge. The body, made up of newly elected or re-elected deputies themselves, must finish its work by Sept. 1, the date of outgoing President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s state-of-the-union address. The chamber must also certify the presidential election by the Dec. 1 inauguration day of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> candidate. If the deadlines are n't met, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> will suffer twin embarrassments. There will be no Chamber of Deputies to sit in joint session with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>'s speech, and he will be unable to follow the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s tradition of formally introducing the new president. <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> said Thursday the nation's `` constitutional order'' will be shattered if the chamber does not finish by Sept. 1. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> has not lost a presidential election since it was founded in 1929, but the July 6 balloting marked the first time the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> won the presidency with less than 70 percent of the votes cast. The PRI-dominated <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won with 50.36 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> leader who broke away to head the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, came in second with 31.1 percent. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> came in third with 17 percent. Also for the first time, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> did not win every race for the 64-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Four opposition senators already have been certified for their posts. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, sitting as a separate electoral college, has been meeting routinely. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> have urged Mexicans to reject the election results. They have also accused the government of denying the electoral colleges access to documents from about half the nation's 55,000 polling stations. The government denies the charge. On Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> majority on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rejected an opposition proposal to let the two electoral colleges examine the documents. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> said it was n't necessary since party representatives saw them on election day, the <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION> news service said. Soldiers earlier this week blocked opposition deputies from entering the room where ballots are under guard. By law, the deputies - and senators-elect sit as separate electoral colleges to certify their own elections, and then the 500-member Chamber of Deputies sits as an electoral college to certify the presidential election

<HEAD>Intellectuals Discuss Plans for Monument to Stalin's Victims</HEAD>

 Pain and suffering were written on the face of <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotlyar </PERSON> as he stressed to prominent political and cultural figures the importance of building a center to chronicle the millions _ like himself _ who fell victim to <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The frail man of 80 said he spent 14 years in a labor camp after being arrested in 1929 on trumped-up charges, and hoped he would live to see the building completed. `` We are n't doing it for us, but for the future generation,'' to prevent a repetition of the terror, the balding <PERSON> Kotlyar </PERSON> said, his body shaking, his voice trembling. <PERSON> Kotlyar </PERSON> stood with a cane at a microphone Thursday night in a packed auditorium. For 2 -LCB- hours, about 200 intellectuals at the Union of Architects headquarters brainstormed about what a monument to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims should look like, where it should be built and whether it should be accompanied by a center that would study the repressions. No formal program or plan came out of the session, which brought together the main forces behind the drive to put up a monument to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims: the informal group Memorial, officials of theatrical, film and architect unions, <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>, and the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>. There was no agenda, and those interested in speaking simply took the microphone. `` We are tired of monuments,'' said <PERSON> Kotlyar </PERSON>. `` We have so many of them. We need a center.'' One of the center's main tasks, he said, should be to answer the question of how many people were killed and imprisoned by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> from the 1930s to 1950s. Those in the audience included <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, one of the founders of the country's dissident movement. Seated nearby was <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, who publishes an unsanctioned journal called `` Glasnost,'' named after <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness. He received a fresh reminder Sunday, after a demonstration against the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 20 years ago, that even under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, expression of dissident political views can land a citizen in jail. <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> was among dozens of demonstrators hauled away to a police station. Two popular intellectuals who have used art as axes to chip away at Stalinism, author <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybakov </PERSON> and playwright <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatrov </PERSON>, also attended. Last winter, Memorial, a band of scholars, lawyers and history buffs, took to the streets with a petition drive and demonstrations that got them detentions, fines and threats. But the crackdown was halted suddenly this summer. With <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s support, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference that ended July 1 passed a resolution called for a monument in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims, who Western specialists estimate number about 20 million. The Union of Architects has since proposed converting a prison in <LOCATION> Sukhanovo </LOCATION>, 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, into a complex that would include a monument, museum and archives containing documents about the victims. <PERSON> Sukhanovo </PERSON> was a monastery before Soviet rule but under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was used as a prison where inmates were routinely tortured. It is believed to be run now by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. A competition for the design of the memorial complex is to be held late this year or early next year, and organizers have set up a special bank account to accept donations from the public to finance the project. Groups in the Baltic republics and the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Chita </LOCATION> are raising money for local monuments to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims.

 The number of applicants to medical schools is at a 10-year low, partly because `` Baby Boomers'' are passing college age and partly because the medical profession has lost some of its glow, officials say. Medical school applicants numbered 10 percent fewer for the 1987-88 academic year than in 1986-87, and more than 30 percent fewer than a decade before, according to a report in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` Physicians are generally advising potential medical school applicants not to go to medical school,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Marten </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernis </PERSON>, vice dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest medical school with 1,300 students. `` Physicians are working right now in a changing environment with all sorts of federal regulations being imposed, changing reimbursement policies, huge increases in medical malpractice liability premiums, large increases in lawsuits, changes in the tax structure, et cetera,'' he said Thursday. `` Many physicians are arguing that these characteristics are mitigating against the practice of medicine.'' The journal also noted that eight of 10 medical students are debt when they graduate, and their average debt load is larger than it has ever been _ $ 35,621 in 1987. The greatest increases in medical school enrollment are among women and minorities, the journal said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that medicine has lost some of its luster. `` We know for certain that young people these days who otherwise would be interested and qualified are being turned away from medicine by their perception of what's involved _ both medical education and practice,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> last week decided to cut 1989 enrollment by 10 percent, in keeping with reduced federal support the past several years because of a projected doctor glut. Other schools are following a similar course, said <PERSON> Kernis </PERSON>, who noted that colleges and medical schools are seeing the end of the `` Baby Boom'' generation. In addition, potential applicants may be discouraged by the increasing cost of medical education, the perception that medicine is more technological and less humane than it once was and the long period of training involved, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> reported that a total of 65,742 students were enrolled in the nation's 127 accredited medical schools for 1987-88, a decline of 400 students from the previous year and 1,701 fewer than in 1983-84. The number of applicants was down for the third straight year, to 28,123, and reflects a general decline over the past 10 years. In 1977-78, for example, medical school applicants numbered 40,569, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> said. In the past five years, the number of first-year white male students has decreased by 13.2 percent, to 8,216, while the number of black male students has decreased by 6.8 percent, to 572, the journal said. But in the same period, the number of first-year white female students increased by less than one-tenth of 1 percent, to 4,363, while the number of black female students increased 31.7 percent, to 682, it said. Women accounted for 37 percent of 1987-88 medical school applicants and 36.5 percent of entering classes, the journal said. The number of Asians or <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> entering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical schools has more than doubled, with the percentage of first-year male students increasing by 106.5 percent, to 1,179, and that of female students by 128.4 percent, to 676, the journal said. `` I think that's a social phenomenon,'' <PERSON> Kernis </PERSON> said. `` We've had a lot of immigration among Pacific islanders and Vietnamese and Cambodians.''

 Nearly 12,000 people and dozens of famous friends sang `` Happy Birthday'' to <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> in a four-hour tribute that left <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most famous living conductor, usually loquacious, nearly speechless. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> chuckled and wept as friends, including actress <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> and composer-producer <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, recalled the conductor-composer's life and work at Thursday night's 70th birthday gala at the Tanglewood music festival. But words almost failed the maestro when he was pulled to the lectern for the finale. As hundreds of performers and the audience of 12,000 stamped their feet, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> shook his head `` no.'' He grabbed the microphone, said, `` As <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> would say ...,'' then let out a wail characteristic of the comic pianist. Most of the audience and 250 performers then sang `` Happy Birthday'' to <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> before he walked offstage ahead of <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and other celebrated pals. The <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> gala was billed as one of the music world's great events The master of ceremonies was <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON>, the former diva who is retiring as director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> in November. `` I love <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON>,'' she said. `` The only thing I would not do for him is sing.'' Besides the friends who volunteered their talents to honor <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and benefit the music school where he cut his conducting teeth, performers, playwrights, poets and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION> _ his old orchestra _ videotaped birthday messages that were televised on huge screens at <LOCATION> Tanglewood </LOCATION>. It was all in honor of a man who gained enormous popularity and fame with works ranging from Broadway classics like `` West Side Story'' to classical compositions like `` Mass.'' `` There once was a boy named <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON>, whose talents were varied and many,'' sang <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON> in a song written by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> for the occasion. `` Poor <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON>, 10 gifts too many.'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s flamboyance at the baton. `` A normal conductor comes in, bows, turns his back on the audience and that's it,'' <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> said. `` With <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON>, he comes in, you're already smiling.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> recalled being shocked when he first met <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. `` I was all set to meet a man who was shy and introverted, conservative, concerned about health food,'' recalled <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` Wrong. This man goes to bed at 6:30 in the morning and at 6:45 he wakes up.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> sent a congratulatory letter that began `` Dear Genius,'' and there were affectionate regards from leaders of several countries, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainier </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> kissed and hugged friends throughout the night, but declined to talk about the celebration and ordered photographers to stop taking pictures of his 90-year-old mother, <PERSON> Jennie </PERSON>. `` You're going to tire out my poor old mummy,'' he said. But `` mummy'' was impressed. `` I've been to many events with <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON>, but this here tops it all,'' she said. The concert, which launched a four-day benefit for the <ORGANIZATION> Tanglewood </ORGANIZATION> music school, featured a smattering of short pieces with a strong personal connection to <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. Songwriter <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Comden </PERSON> and pop singer <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Austen </PERSON>, for example, sang tunes from his Broadway shows `` On the Town'' and `` Wonderful Town.'' His children sang a song they had written for him which included the lines `` It's true the most difficult man in my life is you. A guy who gives and gives is a hard kind of guy to live with.''

<HEAD>Korean Talks Break Down; No More Discussions On Olympics Set</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today failed to clear the way for full-scale talks on sharing the Olympics and on a non-aggression pact, and both sides blamed each other for the breakdown. The only agreement after more than three hours of talks was to meet again Oct. 13 after the Olympics to continue talks on easing tension. The two five-member delegations of legislators shook hands and smiled before the meeting at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce site, which straddles the neutral Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas. But delegates later blamed each other for failing to resolve the dispute over the Olympics, to be held in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Sept. 17-Oct. 2 `` It has been confirmed that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> attempted to blow away the Olympic question,'' the chief North Korean delegate, <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, told reporters. South Korean officials refused to rule out the possibility of a last-minute bid to get the North to take part in the Games, but they have rejected the North's demand to be a co-host of the Games. `` At this stage one thing is sure, that co-hosting is impossible,'' said South Korean delegate <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Han-dong </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> denied the North would attempt to disrupt the Olympics. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fears its archrival may stage terrorist attacks during the Games. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Olympics unless it is made a co-host. The International Olympic Committee rejected the demand, saying the Olympics are awarded to a single city and can not be shared. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> insists that full-scale talks should have non-aggression as their top item. It also demands the full parliaments of both sides take part, while the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> called for smaller delegations. Also disputed is a North Korean demand that the two legislatures publish a joint declaration of non-aggression, calling for the withdrawal of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> considers the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence essential to its defense. The chief South Korean delegate, <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Joon-kyu </PERSON>, told reporters the talks should not be considered a failure, because the two sides had agreed to another meeting. `` The best thing to come out of this meeting is that we continue to have talks,'' he said. The two Koreas are bitter rivals with hundreds of thousands of troops facing each other along their tense 150-mile border. The peninsula was divided into communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and pro-Western <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> at the end of World War II. They fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, which left more than a million people dead.

In a brief dispatch from the city of <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION> near the crescent-shaped lake that is the deepest in the world, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the 31-year-old resident of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamitos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, swam about 11.25 miles in 52-degree water. She began at Tolstoy Cap and finished at the lakeside village of <LOCATION> Listvyanka </LOCATION> in good physical condition, the news agency said. `` It was the first time in history that such a long swim was accomplished in the icy waters of <LOCATION> Baikal </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Ms. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, who had planned to do the swim Sunday, moved up the date because of forecasts of bad weather in the lake area next week.

<TEXT>
 Famed trial attorney <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, best known for bartering a guilty plea for the life of the man who killed Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, has died at age 86. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, often hailed as the king of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' criminal defense lawyers, died minutes after suffering cardiac arrest Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s law partner, said <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> was admitted to the hospital July 15. He was being released last week when he suffered a heart attack. `` He worked up until the day he went into the hospital,'' said <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> for 14 years. `` He actually conducted business in the intensive care unit. He was shooing doctors away.'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> was known for his courtroom theatrics, issue-clouding rhetoric, spotlight shifting and verbal attacks on prosecution witnesses that kept law students and spectators spellbound. `` In a murder case, you should never allow the defendant to be tried,'' he once explained. `` Try someone else _ the husband, the lover, the police, or if the case has social implications, society generally. But never the defendant.'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, however, persuaded <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> to plead guilty to the 1968 slaying of King, the Nobel Prize-winning civil rights activist, in exchange for a 99-year sentence. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> charged later that <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> pressured him into the plea by saying the odds were `` 99 percent'' certain he would go to the electric chair if he faced a jury. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> estimated once he had tried 1,500 death penalty cases, but of his clients, only a restaurateur named <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was executed. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was convicted in 1952 of shooting his wife and <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, who consistently opposed the death penalty, said later <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> had `` deserved to die.'' `` You ca n't win'em all,'' he said. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, born in a log cabin outside <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> on June 21, 1902, was the middle child in a family of 10. His father and grandfather were sheriffs of <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, but he chose to study law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. `` I decided at age 8 to become a lawyer,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> during an interview last December. `` I was operating a shoeshine stand on a principal corner of the courthouse. Lawyers would sit around the corner. They seemed to live better and work less. I thought it'd be an easy way to make a living.'' Aside from handling death penalty cases, <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> also made headlines by handling divorce cases and claimed to have handled more divorce cases than anyone else in the world. He was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for having attained the highest cash settlement in a contested divorce in 1963 when <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaffer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> got $ 9.5 million in cash, plus $ 20 million to $ 30 million in art. `` His style, his technique, his manner of handling himself before the jury had a dramatic affect on my career. Not only mine, but many other men and women in the state who practice law,'' said <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s other famed attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> `` Racehorse'' <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, who used to skip law school classes to watch <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> in court. `` I do n't pretend to be the greatest lawyer who ever lived or even the greatest lawyer today,'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> said in December. `` But on the other hand I do n't deny it.'' <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON>, died in 1979. Survivors include a son, <PERSON> William </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>; a daughter, <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>; a brother, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>; and two sisters. Services were tentatively set for Monday in Settegast-Kopf Funeral Home, <PERSON> DeGeurin </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediators are working on a compromise plan for 50,000 Cuban troops to withdraw from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> within 18 months, sources close to negotiations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> said. But the plan, offered during talks scheduled to conclude today, is likely to be unacceptable to the Angolans and Cubans who were insisting on a minimum of two years, the sources said. They spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has promised to pull its troops out of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by Sept. 1 and grant independence to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, within a year, as long as the Cubans withdraw. The Marxist Angolan government publicly has offered to send the <LOCATION> Cubans </LOCATION> home in four years. On Thursday, the four parties did not meet together, leaving the Americans to work out a compromise proposal. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, secretary of state for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> affairs, said the talks `` were well on their way,'' though it is `` too soon to anticipate their results.'' He commented in an interview with <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> radio broadcast Thursday. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said all parties had `` adopted a serious and constructive approach'' for the conference. Diplomats refused to discuss details of the talks or say whether new proposals for the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal were offered.

But outside the station, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> taunted <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, chanting `` Sissy, <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON>,'' as he was booed by a pro-Tyson neighborhood crowd. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who once fought for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boxing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> heavyweight title and lost in the ring to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> two years ago, told police <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> knocked him down with a punch during a pre-dawn scuffle Tuesday outside a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> haberdashery. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> hit me and ran like a sissy,'' he told reporters during a news conference, adding that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> hit him after he told the champ he did not fight hard in their 1986 bout because he had been cheated by promoter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s description, issued a few hours later, was equally succinct: `` He hit me first, I hit back and the fight was over ... faster than <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON>,'' a reference to <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s first-round knockout of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON> earlier this year. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> fractured a bone in his hand when he hit <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, placing in jeopardy his title defense against <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, scheduled for Oct. 8.

The judge scheduled a Monday hearing on the suit. The controversy over the mayor's race erupted Wednesday when the council's three black members _ including <PERSON> Cleophus </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, who is seeking to become <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>'s first black mayor _ voted against certifying Tuesday's election results, which appeared to return <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> to office without a runoff. The three white council members voted for certification. `` We might as well have been in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. `` We sit around and let a dictator run things.'' After the meeting, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> almost came to blows with city attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitts </PERSON>. One of <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s campaign aides and another man were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct. Attorney J.L. Chestnut, who represents two of the three black council members, said he doubts <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> has the authority to force elected officials to certify the election. `` This is a racially polarized city,'' <PERSON> Chestnut </PERSON> said of the community of 27,000. `` There is absolutely no sentiment in black <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION> to certify any election.'' `` This is one of the worst incidents I've seen since 1964,'' said <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON>, referring to the start of civil rights protests that marked his first year as mayor. On March 7, 1965, several hundred civil rights activists began a 50-mile voting rights march to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>. State troopers and sheriff's deputies, acting under orders from Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, beat marchers as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Television film of the beatings shocked the nation. Unofficial city results showed <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> defeating <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> by 3,752 votes to 2,769. A third candidate, <PERSON> Coy </PERSON> <PERSON> Darby </PERSON>, had 453 votes. If the results are upheld, <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> would not face a runoff because he received more than half the vote. A second council meeting held Wednesday afternoon was boycotted by the three black members. Without a quorum, no action could be taken. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> aide, said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> heard of numerous irregularities in the election, including a predominantly black precinct where polls opened 20 minutes late and had no official poll workers for hours. Also, she claimed, city officials posted voter rolls only 10 days before the election while the requirement is 30 days. Ms. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Police Chief <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Summerlin </PERSON> intimidated people by showing up at several polling places and asking workers `` if they knew what they were doing.'' <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON>, a one-time segregationist, defeated another black challenger in 1984 and took about 20 percent of the black vote. At the 20th anniversary of the 1965 voting rights march, <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> joined black leaders at the observance and, at one point, shared a hymnal with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and joined him in singing `` The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' A policeman was stationed in front of <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON>'s office and extra patrols were scheduled for his residence after Wednesday's confrontations

 For seven summers, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zucchini </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> aficionados have converged on southwest <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> to sing the praises of their favorite squash. But the zucchini fest has lost some of its zest, say fans of the cucumber look-alike.

Fittingly, the Olympics are this year's theme for the fund raiser. Events will include a zucchini toss, javelin throw _ and zucchini rap contest. Individual vegetables will be awarded such high honors as `` most international zucchini,'' `` best-dressed zucchini,'' and `` best zucchini Olympic pet.'' The festival is held to raise money for the private <ORGANIZATION> Harrisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Harrisville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Center and the <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monadnock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Colony </PERSON>, who founded the event with his wife, said he's amazed the festival lasted this long `` When my wife and I thought of the idea, we thought it would go one for two or three years,'' he said. `` If you're working on it every year, it gets kind of tiresome. It's like telling the same joke over and over.''

Police officers <PERSON> Cassie </PERSON> <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> passed up the traditional gown and tuxedo for a short wedding ceremony Wednesday in district court. Instead, the off-duty officers exchanged vows before Magistrate <PERSON> Krista </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON> in their uniforms, complete with service revolvers. They are n't partners, but work the same shift. `` We just have a lot in common and understand what the other has gone through,'' <PERSON> Darnell </PERSON> said before the ceremony. `` Before we started dating, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said he would never marry another police officer.'' They dated for about a year, and <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> eventually changed his mind. All he could say Wednesday was, `` I'm very happy.'' More than 30 people attended the ceremony, including 15 or so police officers. The couple exchanged vows under the bright lights of television cameras. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> blushed when instead of saying `` I pledge my faith unto you,'' he said, `` I pledge my faith on TV.'' He got it right the second time.

<HEAD>Botha Welcomed In Black Settlement Once Targeted For Demolition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Since it mushroomed overnight on Easter 1974, this black shantytown has been visited regularly by police, bulldozers and eviction agents. Today, in what aides called a symbolic move, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> visited the settlement outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> that his government tried so many times to destroy. Each time, the shacks of plastic sheeting and corrugated tin were smashed. Each time, they reappeared in a different sandy field. Each time, truckloads of women and children were carted away to rural homelands, separated from the men who had jobs in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Thousands more families replaced them. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, making one of his few visits to a black township in his 10 years as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s head of state, was loudly cheered when he arrived at the long-troubled area that the government is now trying to develop for blacks who fought anti-apartheid activists. `` Thank you, we accept you as our leader,'' a black choir sang in the Xhosa language. The group said they made up the song for <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s visit to Crossroads, where dozens of people were killed and 70,000 people left homeless during unrest in May and June of 1986. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> stopped at a recently established employment center, where appointed Mayor <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngxobongwana </PERSON> welcomed the president `` in the name of all Crossroads residents.'' Not everyone was happy about <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s visit. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eck </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said of Crossroads, `` The black community that rejects an Archbishop -LRB- <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and accepts into its midst the oppressor, Mr. <PERSON> P.W </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' He was referring to graffiti on a wall near the main entrance to Crossroads that says: `` No entry for <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'' _ the black Anglican leader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against apartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in national affairs. Mayor <PERSON> Ngxobongwana </PERSON> headed so-called vigilantes from the oldest section of Crossroads who burned down neighborhoods in 1986 where militant young anti-apartheid activists held sway. The government is building new homes for <PERSON> Ngxobongwana </PERSON>'s supporters, while most of his displaced opponents have moved where the government wanted them _ a massive black township called <LOCATION> Khayelitsha </LOCATION>, farther from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the employment center was an example of his government's attempts to develop black areas. `` To boycott is easy, but it leads nowhere,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told about 200 people in the center. `` To cooperate is sometimes difficult and to take responsibility sometimes difficult. But history remembers only those who build, not those who destroy.'' The center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry, bricklaying, sewing and other skills. The shantytown's troubled history centers around the white-dominated government's former policy that people of mixed-race had preference over blacks for all jobs in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> region and that blacks lived there only as temporary workers. Crossroads was born as a result of the government's attempt to remove several `` black spots,'' where blacks lived illegally. When three such areas were demolished in 1974, residents packed their few possessions and moved, but only as far as an intersection near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s airport. By 1976, Crossroads was a squatter city of 60,000 people, and the government declared it an `` emergency camp.'' Subsequent demolitions and evictions failed to stem its growth. In 1984, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> abandoned the idea that the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> should be a job-preference area for mixed-race people and promised a halt to forced removals for race separation purposes. By 1986, an estimated 200,000 blacks were living in Crossroads' slums But during a four-week period in May and June that year, battles broke out between factions in different neighborhoods. Scores of people died, and 70,000 were burned out of their shacks. Residents and community workers said police aided the so-called vigilantes from the oldest section of Crossroads, who burned down neighborhoods where militant young anti-apartheid activists lived. Critics charged that the 1986 violence was part of a government plan to clear out overcrowded slums so they could be rebuilt with lower density while troublemakers were moved farther away. The <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is hearing the first of more than 3,000 damage suits by those who lost their homes. They charge the police and government with responsibilty.

 Mechanics joined hundreds of other workers on strike at a steel mill in southeastern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and police backed off after staging a massive show of force around a strikebound coal mine, labor leaders said today. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s powerful <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops urged the government to renounce force in settling strikes around the country and reiterated their stand that the government should allow free trade unions _ a key demand of strikers. <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuberna </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the outlawed Solidarity free trade union, said about 3,000 workers were occupying the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> steel mill. She said the mechanics joined other strikers late Thursday and that the mill was shut down. Workers arriving for the first shift today were turned away by management, <PERSON> Kuberna </PERSON> said. In the coal mining region of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>, police briefly surrounded the July Manifesto mine near <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> late Thursday, Solidarity activists said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, a Solidarity spokesman in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said about 100 police vehicles, some equipped with water cannons, surrounded the mine where a strike spawned <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest since 1981. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said police drove up to the main gate and turned flood lights on the compound, which has been occupied by strikers for 11 days. He said security forces made no attempt to enter the mine, where an estimated 600 workers remained holed up. Police left a short time later, <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said. `` Intimidation and force must be abandoned, and the reasonable voice of all the citizens of the country must be loyally acknowledged,'' the bishops said in their first statement on the strikes that began Aug. 16. They implicitly criticized the government for not meeting agreements signed with workers during the 1981 unrest, saying `` The social accords signed eight years ago and developed with such difficulty remain a task to be fulfilled.'' Earlier Thursday, three strikes crumbled in <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> and steel workers gave up an on-again, off-again strike in the <LOCATION> Nowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huta </LOCATION> steel mill outside <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. Strikes continued along <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Baltic coast, in the major ports of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, and at least two coal mines, in addition to July Manifesto, remained crippled by strikes. The strikers are demanding legalization of the Solidarity trade union federation and better wages. An 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew was in effect in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, at the heart of the coal mine strikes. Provincial officials decreed Thursday that non-residents were not permitted in the town. One strike committee member said riot police beat at least six miners when they forced strikers to evacuate three paralyzed mines Wednesday night, including the <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Morcinek </LOCATION> mine in nearby <LOCATION> Kaszyce </LOCATION>. But at least 20 people remained barricaded underground at the third mine, the <LOCATION> Mosczenica </LOCATION>, witnesses said. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said strikes ended Thursday at three other shafts _ the <PERSON> Krupinski </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ZMP </ORGANIZATION> and First of May. Strikes continued in only three mines, down from 12 at the beginning of this week. Still strikebound were the July Manifesto, <PERSON> Jastrzebie </PERSON> and 30 Years of People's <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> mines, the first to declare strikes. The <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> port, the country's busiest, remained totally shut down, according to reporters. But the state-controlled media said parts of the port were working. <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>'s port director issued an ultimatum that dockworkers would be fired unless they signed statements that they are not on strike. At the 30,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Nowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huta </ORGANIZATION> steel mill, workers who tried to start a strike Wednesday idled various departments for 24 hours. The last strikers gave up Thursday afternoon, said <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Handzlik </PERSON>, a member of the plant's Solidarity organizing committee. Tentative talks began Thursday at the strikebound <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION> port between a strike committee and management. But <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalczyk </PERSON>, a spokesman for the strikers, complained that even while talks were going on, two ships containing security troops menaced the dockworkers by sailing near the docks, although the troops did n't land. Official accounts made no mention of a police role in ending any strike, saying only that strikers gave up and reporting preparations to restart work. <PERSON> Francinek </PERSON> <PERSON> Cichon </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Morcinek </ORGANIZATION> strike committee, said six men at <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> were beaten as well as men at <LOCATION> Morcinek </LOCATION>, but that no strikers needed hospitalization. There were some detentions, he said. Also Thursday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional staffer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> announced that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would soon approve a $ 1 million grant to help Solidarity, which was outlawed by the Polish government in 1982. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, at a gathering of more than 600 activists from East and West who came together for an unofficial human rights conference. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which does research and provides support for Conservative members of the chamber, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already has provided two such grants to Solidarity.

 The heaviest rainfall in 20 years has drenched much of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, causing widespread damage and at least 50 deaths, officials say. The Sahel states, impoverished nations on the southern fringe of the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> that have suffered recurring droughts for most of the last 20 years, have received the heaviest rainfall, said <PERSON> Benoi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortier </PERSON> of AGHRY-Met, an agricultural research center in the <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Niamey </LOCATION>. Cortier, interviewed by telephone, said Thursday that the rainfall zone extends from <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> along the West African coast more than 2,400 miles to the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. It also stretches as far inland to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Cortier </PERSON> said despite the damage caused by the rainfall that the region should generally have a better harvest year than in recent years. Since the rainy season began in June, the most rainfall in the region was reported at a station in <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>, which received 56 inches. Most of the Sahel nations have received more than their annual average rainfall the past three months. <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION>, for example, received 27.4 inches, compared with an annual average 22.4 inches. Rainfall in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> this month was the heaviest since 1928, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> overflowed, blocking many roads and leaving many villages isolated. The only feasible transport in some areas was the pirogue, a canoe-shaped boat. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> reported the most damage in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, with thousands of homes destroyed in <LOCATION> Kano </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Borno </LOCATION> states in the country's northeast More than 300,000 people were made homeless, the military government said.

 Three street-preaching youngsters who have been repeatedly suspended from school for shouting sermons will be taught at home and have agreed to no longer preach on school grounds, officials say. The Strode children _ <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON>, 11, Pepper, 7 and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, 6 _ left <ORGANIZATION> Eastfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> this week to begin home instruction, after another confrontation the first day of school. Each had been suspended five times last spring for shouting Bible verses outside school or for refusing to enter the building. Their father, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stode </PERSON>, had said Wednesday they would continue to preach at school despite the agreement to have them taught at home. But after four hours of negotiations Wednesday night, <ORGANIZATION> McDowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> school Superintendent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> announced a new agreement. `` We have reached a new level of trust and understanding,'' <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> said. `` The Strodes have agreed not to preach or disturb our schools, not even to preach at ball games.'' In return, <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> said, school officials have dropped attempts to get Strode to sign a release absolving the schools from litigation. `` They have no desire to sue us and we certainly have no desire to sue them,'' <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION>, who has been street preaching with Strode, took part in the negotiations. `` I said ... ` You got to understand me and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>. When we look at you, we do n't see lawyer and <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON>. We see the Devil,''' <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. `` ` Everything we deal with has to be in that Bible.

 A black union organizer detained without charge for 26 months died in a hospital today, three days after collapsing in his prison cell, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the country's largest black labor federation, demanded authorities explain the circumstances surrounding the death of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Makeleng </PERSON> and said its lawyers were investigating <PERSON> Makeleng </PERSON>, 27, was detained June 12, 1986 _ the day President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared a state of emergency that remains in effect. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for varying periods during the emergency, and five are known to have died in custody. Police said <PERSON> Makeleng </PERSON> had complained of repeated headaches and was treated by doctors at the Nylstroom Prison near the northern town of <LOCATION> Pietersburg </LOCATION>. His condition `` suddenly deteriorated'' Tuesday and he was taken first to a local hospital and then airlifted to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The trade union congress said <PERSON> Makeleng </PERSON> had a `` mass of water on the brain'' and was on a life support system at the time of his death. <PERSON> Makeleng </PERSON> was an organizer for the South African Allied Workers Union and worked as a publicity secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition. He was never charged with a crime and had not been questioned by police in more than a year, according to his attorney, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayson </PERSON>. `` Our lawyers are investigating the full circumstances and we demand a full explanation from prison authorities and security police,'' the union congress said. `` This tragedy once again reflects the precarious position of detainees and counts as a grim reminder of the basic inhumanity of detention.'' The state-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> official apologized for the company's role in a defense fraud case after the company paid a $ 3 million penalty for conspiring to overcharge the government for military aircraft and M-1 tank parts. `` TRW as a company deeply regretted that the events occurred. We have taken steps to try and prevent a recurrence of those incidents,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> vice president and assistant secretary, said Thursday outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. Minutes earlier, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> had waived the company's right to a trial and entered a guilty plea on its behalf before Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The combined fine and criminal penalty was one of the largest ever assessed against a defense contractor, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. Four former <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> employees pleaded guilty earlier to conspiring to defraud the government, and a fifth is to be tried Sept. 6 on charges of conspiracy and making false statements, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said the conspiracy was limited to low-level managers. The company also paid a separate $ 3 million to be applied as an advance payment on restitution to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. The money brings to $ 11.8 million the amount <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> has given the government to settle a pending civil lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> estimates its Compressor Components Division overcharged the government between $ 3 million and $ 11 million, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. The company sold the <ORGANIZATION> Compressor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Components </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 as part of a corporate restructuring. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said he did not expect Thursday's settlement to affect other <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> defense contracts or attempts to bid for additional defense work. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiring between 1973 and 1984 to inflate labor expenses for the manufacture of military aircraft engine parts. The company also admitted it had conspired to inflate labor costs on compressor fan blades for the M-1 tank between 1980 and 1984. The third count accused the company of conspiring to charge the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for operations and labor never performed in the manufacture of blades for the J-79 aircraft engine. The guilty plea concludes a federal investigation that began in 1984, when <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily disclosed that its employees had engaged in questionable conduct, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Citing freedom of expression, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has barred the use of pandering laws to prosecute a filmmaker whose cast performed sex acts on camera. The prosecution under pandering laws, which forbid the procuring of prostitutes for pay, `` must be viewed as a somewhat transparent ` end run' around the First Amendment and the state obscenity laws,'' Justice <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said in Thursday's unanimous decision. He also said pandering laws, if allowed in such cases and applied to their limits, could be used against `` films of unquestioned artistic and social merit, as well as films made for medical or educational purposes.'' Only a handful of pending prosecutions were directly affected by the case. But lawyers said prosecutors in several counties were following the ruling closely and would have been prepared to file similar charges against local sex-film makers if the court had allowed it. `` If they could n't get a conviction under the obscenity section, this -LRB- pandering -RRB- was the only thing left,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfarb </PERSON>, a lawyer for producer <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, the defendant in the case. He said there had been no attempt to prove that <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s movie, `` Caught from Behind, Part II,'' was obscene. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> was convicted of pandering for paying the cast in the September 1983 movie to engage in sexual acts on film. Although the pandering law requires at least a three-year prison sentence, the judge said prison was unwarranted in <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s case and gave him 90 days in jail; that sentence, challenged by the prosecutor, was never served. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> gave two reasons for overturning the conviction: <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s conduct was not covered by the pandering laws; and, if the laws had applied, they would be unconstitutional in his case. The cast of the film was paid for acting, and not for `` sexual arousal or gratification,'' so they were not prostitutes and <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>'s hiring of them was not pandering, <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant who allegedly led an international spy ring sold the Soviets secret documents on nuclear missile bases, military pipelines and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> troop strength, news reports said today. The Bild newspaper of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, which is known to have close contacts to intelligence sources, quoted an unidentified West German security official as saying <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> had sold `` extraordinarily important information.'' A special <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> panel ordered <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> held in prison pending further investigation following his arrest Tuesday. He was charged with `` compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially grave case,'' according to the prosecutor's office. Two men who officials said were part of the ring were arraigned today in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON>, the chief federal prosecutor, said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> also recruited a second American soldier who received a `` five-figure sum'' of money for supplying the ring with military secrets. <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> refused to elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said information contained in documents that <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> allegedly sold included `` secret locations of nuclear missiles, classified documents about pipeline systems, defense plans of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> divisions, and top-secret troop mobilization plans.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> also reported that such information was sold by the ring, which allegedly had been operating since the late 1970s. The Times quoted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and German officials as saying <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> guarded a safe that stored documents at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kreuznach </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> lived in an elegantly furnished apartment near the base. Officials have said the ring was believed to have stolen documents concerning <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense plans for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> contingency plans for a ground war with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office, said Thursday that it's too early to determine what damage the spying caused the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` We ca n't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars are involved,'' he said. `` It could take months before we know the full extent of the damage to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defenses,'' he added. He refused to release any further details about the probe. In <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, a district court today arraigned two Hungarian-born brothers, who <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said were part of the ring. Chief Prosecutor <PERSON> Sven-Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakansson </PERSON> said the men, arrested Tuesday, acknowledged working for the Hungarian intelligence service. Security officials said <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kercsik </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kercsik </PERSON>, 34, were suspected of `` preparing unlawful intellegence activity and supporting preparations of criminal acts.'' A third suspect, the wife of one of the brothers, was detained for questioning and released. Her arraignment was not immediately sought. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the spy case `` a serious encroachment on our national security.'' Army records released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, of Sebring, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was born in 1947 and worked for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military for 20 years, first as an infantryman and then as an `` administration specialist.'' According to his service records, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> received the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION>, five Army Commendation medals, the Army Achievement Medal, three <ORGANIZATION> Meritorious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> medals and seven Good Conduct medals. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> worked with classified military defense plans for seven years at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Bad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kreuznach </LOCATION> with access to a wide array of secret documents. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> allegedly engaged in espionage work after he left the service in 1985, <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said. In a statement, <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> had turned over the most recent batch of information to his Soviet bloc contact in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Rebmann </PERSON> said officials still were investigating to determine exactly what was missing. Cable News Network on Thursday quoted unidentified West German sources as saying <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> systematically photographed files from 1980 to 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> report said investigators believe he may have transferred material onto a personal computer, which was seized at his home. <PERSON> Prechtel </PERSON> said that while `` several'' people had been taken into custody or arrested, he could not confirm a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> report Thursday that eight people were rounded up. The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including agents from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Army has about 250,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at more than 200 installations and frequently warns its personnel to beware of Soviet bloc spies.

<TEXT>
 A jury resumed deliberations today on racketeering charges against 20 men in what authorities call the nation's longest federal criminal trial, which has had more than a year of testimony and evidence. Prosecutors charge the defendants constituted the hierarchy of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> faction of the Lucchese organized crime family. The organization allegedly ran loan-sharking, drug-dealing, illegal gambling and fraudulent credit card operations, the government says. The principal defendant is reputed crime family captain <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Tumac'' Accetturo of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who allegedly controlled the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> faction. The trial, which began with jury selection in November 1986, frequently has been characterized by courtroom outbursts, wrangling among the attorneys and delays needed to sort problems created by the multitude of defendants. That atmosphere carried over to the first day of deliberations Thursday, when the jury asked its first question just 10 minutes after beginning work, asking for a copy of the indictment and transcripts of opening arguments, and the lawyers began arguing about how much should be given to the panel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> rapped his gavel and said: `` I've asked you in the nicest way, three times. Please be quiet!'' The jury's indictment question was resolved when lawyers learned that the jury already had a copy of it, along with a roomful of exhibits, but did n't know it was there. Two hours later, when the transcripts issue was near resolution, the jury sent back another note: `` Cancel request.'' All 20 defendants are named in the first count, charging a conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. According to the Administrative Office of the Courts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the trial is believed to be the nation's longest federal criminal proceeding, surpassing the so-called `` Pizza Connection'' heroin smuggling case that ended after 17 months in March 1987. The trial, which yielded more than 40,000 pages of transcripts, 850 exhibits and testimony by 89 witnesses, ended 22 months and four days after the first of 1,500 people reported to court for jury selection.

<HEAD>Income Up As Spending Surge Slows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal incomes climbed a healthy 0.6 percent in July while consumer spending slowed from its breakneck pace of the previous month, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the increase in incomes matched a 0.6 percent rise in June and would have been even stronger except for a drop in government subsidy payments to farmers. Personal consumption spending, which includes virtually everything except interest payments on debt, rose 0.5 percent in July, less than half the 1.1 percent rise in June. The report attributed much of the slowdown to a decline in sales of new cars. The slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the economy because of worries that demand this year has been outstripping the ability of factories to produce the goods, thus creating rising inflationary pressures. The income gain looked particularly impressive because the key component, wages and salaries, shot up 1 percent during the month, reflecting continued strong employment gains. This was offset somewhat by a $ 9 billion rate of decline for farm subsidy payments. Excluding these payments, which show extreme month-to-month volatility, personal incomes would have risen 0.8 percent in July. Americans' disposable, or after-tax incomes, rose 0.6 percent in July, down only slightly from a 0.7 percent June increase. With incomes rising slightly faster than spending, the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable incomes, edged up to 4.3 percent in July, compared to 4.2 percent in June. Following the 1.1 percent rise in spending in June, which had been the biggest advance in 10 months, the 0.5 percent July increase reflected gains in purchases of non-durable goods and services. Non-durable goods spending rose at an annual rate of $ 3.5 billion compared to a $ 5.5 billion June increase. Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, increased $ 12.2 billion following an even stronger $ 18.6 billion June increase. But purchases of durable goods showed no change at all following a $ 12 billion rise in June because sales of new cars fell during July.

 Television talk-show host <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> will not be arrested for scuffling with a weekly newspaper editor because a prosecutor says he wants to devote his resources to more serious crimes. Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said he rejected an arrest warrant charging breach of peace that had been prepared by police based on a complaint filed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, editor of the New Haven Independent. `` I denied the warrant, not based on the merits of the case _ because I believe there was a violation by Mr. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> _ but based on other considerations, including the volume of business and the resources of this office,'' <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said his staff in Superior Court can be used more effectively tackling more serious cases such as murders, rapes and other crimes. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said Thursday that he had mixed feelings about the decision. `` I understand <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>'s need to prioritize,'' <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> said. `` The courts are overbooked with cases. ... I'm very glad he said in his statement that <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> broke the law. But, he added, `` I think it's unfortunate that some guy who's a celebrity can get away with backing himself up with thousands of groupies and he can get away with attacking someone. If it was a poor black kid with three friends cheering him on, I think he would get arrested.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> could n't immedately be reached for comment. There was no one on his staff at <ORGANIZATION> WWOR-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, at work early today, said a receptionist at the station. New Haven attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> L </PERSON> <PERSON> Grudberg </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, said Thursday: `` Mr. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> exercised his discretion wisely.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised new jobs for minorities and said during a swing through his adopted home state that he'd be a `` good president for all Americans,'' while rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused the vice president of bungling the nation's war against drugs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, maintained his code of silence on embattled <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who encountered fresh doubts about his resume. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was campaigning in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> trying to answer questions on farm and trade issues when The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer reported that he exaggerated his job record in the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Attorney General's office. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had just begun to shed some of the questioning about his military record and relations with a former lobbyist. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> biography, which is being distributed as official background of the Republican vice-presidential nominee, says: `` He was chief investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Attorney General's Office from 1970-1971.'' The Plain Dealer reported that the Consumer Protection Division did n't even exist in 1970 and that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent most of the period as a low-level clerk. It said he put in less than three months in the investigator's job, and had already moved on to another job when the division officially opened for business in September 1971. The new disclosure came just a few hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had declared the controversy over his running mate to be a thing of the past. Campaigning in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with a Mariachi band and wearing a guayaberra, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised in the sweltering late-summer heat of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> `` to help those minorities who have n't really had a shot at the starting line.'' `` The best way to do that in employment is to have urban and rural enterprise zones, a break in that tax structure that will encourage business to locate where those populations are.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tried to create such zones on a national level in the early part of his administration as a means to combat unemployment, but opponents said they failed to produce results when tried on a state level. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he supports affirmative action programs `` so minorities have a better shot at the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' pledged to fight gun control and help the faltering oil industry. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, returning to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> after a <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> sojourn, escalated his attacks on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> through his role in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Why after seven years of task forces and policy boards and grandiose claims have cocaine imports tripled, drug-related deaths doubled, and heroin imports risen by 50 percent?'' he asked at a rally in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He also said the administration's association with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> while he was `` actively involved in the drug business'' was `` criminal.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later attended a fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where 150 gay rights advocates had protested a state policy they say virtually bans placement of foster children in gay and lesbian homes. Only a few protesters remained when he arrived. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> vetoed this measure from the 1988 budget, but now that he has become the Democratic presidential candidate, he has once again chosen to pander to bigotry and prejudice,'' a flier said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ran into flak Thursday when the World War II veteran pilot told a veterans' group that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the Democrats could be trusted with the nation's defense. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, wearing a VFW cap, was warmly received at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But in trying to make the case for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on defense, he was interrupted four times by boos or jeers _ once when he mentioned former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s name. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, appeared to be softening his stance on the Strategic Defense Initiative. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted the Republican in its editions today as saying a decision on whether to deploy a full or partial Star Wars defense system must await more research into its capabilities and costs. `` What I want to do is to continue research at the levels of funding, essentially, that we have requested,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who earlier was promising deployment `` as soon as feasible.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the debate over campaign debates continued. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, said she was encouraged that aides to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would meet next week to begin negotiations on debates for the fall. Democratic chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for indicating on Wednesday that he wanted to wait until at least Sept. 20 before meeting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in debate. `` He's not going to be able to refuse to debate,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said. Republican chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said neither he nor anyone in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign `` agreed to a set number of debates on dates certain or at particular locations.''

 A man opened fire on fellow Palestinians blocking a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> road and wounded a 14-year-old boy, witnesses and army officials said today. Another 14-year-old, <PERSON> Aymen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yammen </PERSON>, died today from a gunshot wound he suffered Aug. 15 during clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of Tal near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. His death brought to 254 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have died. The army maintained curfews on six towns and refugee camps in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It also closed a trade union in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for a year, alleging its members held meetings to initiate anti-Israeli protests, a spokesman said. It was the 10th union to be closed since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8. Meanwhile, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he sees `` positive elements'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> plan to declare a provisional government in the occupied territories, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is declaring its total failure in bringing about the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' Maariv quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as telling aides this week. `` It is reaching a conclusion that we should be confronted on the political level. `` Secondly, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, no matter inside what borders, will influence radical <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states and push them to accept <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s very existence ... and maybe to direct negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ariel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> rejected an upcoming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> review of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s duty-free privileges in response to alleged abuses of Palestinian workers' rights. Sharon alleged Palestinian trade unions are `` cover-ups for terror organizations. They are not innocent workers' unions but front organizations behind which the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s political arm has been hiding for years.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Palestinian lobby in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of indiscriminately closing down union offices, arresting <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> labor activists and denying trade union protection to at least 100,000 Arabs in the territories who travel to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Thursday he would review <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s duty-free trade status following the complaint, which was filed in June. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said: ` We shall explain to our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friends that when it comes to the lives of Jews, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not be pressured by economic sanctions.'' A country found to have abused worker rights risks losing its rights to export products to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> free of charge under the Generalized System of Preferences -LRB- GSP -RRB-. In 1987, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> exported $ 487 million worth of goods under the <ORGANIZATION> GSP </ORGANIZATION> program. The shooting incident occured after youths manning the roadblock in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> attacked the Arab late Thursday because they suspected him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, radio reports said. Only Arabs who provide information to authorities are granted permission to carry a weapon. But an Arab witness said the Arabs were arguing with the man because he demanded to pass through their barricade. He said the man approached the barricade in his car, demanding it be removed. When Arab youths refused and started to argue, `` He just grabbed a pistol and shot the boy,'' said the witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The clash followed three attacks on suspected collaborators in the last two days.

<TEXT>
 Seals in a revamped version of the shuttle booster joint blamed for Challenger's destruction worked in a test firing despite intentional flaws, helping Discovery pass its `` most significant milestone,'' the rocket's manufacturer says. An analysis of the Aug. 18 test at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> plant found that the aft seal, though the worst flawed deliberately, succeeded in preventing superhot gases from escaping, the company said Thursday The success of the test, the fifth and final qualifying firing of the new 126-foot solid-fuel booster, was vital to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to resume shuttle missions grounded since the Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986. `` This may be the most critical milestone as far as getting us back into space,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. `` It's certainly the most significant milestone we've had to pass in the solid rocket motor design. If the positive evaluation of the test holds, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they expect to set a firm date late next month or in early October for Discovery's mission, the first shuttle flight since the Challenger accident. Engineers who took apart the booster's aft segment `` looked at the intentional flaws and were very pleased to see that hot gases had not blown by the primary O-ring, that it had sealed properly,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, another company spokesman. A presidential commission blamed a faulty aft joint on one of Challenger's two boosters for the spacecraft's explosion shortly after liftoff. A plume of superhot gas burned through a rubber-like O-ring in the joint and caused Challenger's outside fuel tank to explode, killing all seven astronauts. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> are investigating what appear to have been deliberate cuts in some O-ring seals destined for use in shuttle boosters, but none of the damaged O-rings had been shipped to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON>, vice president of operations for <ORGANIZATION> HydraPak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, company that produces the O-rings. None of <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON>'s 85 employees has been dismissed, <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said, but he would not say if any had been disciplined. The redesigned joint incorporates a so-called `` capture feature'' designed to seal the rocket during liftoff, preventing hot gases from escaping. Snow said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> engineers will continue tearing down the four-segment rocket over the next week and a half. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> workers completed the first stage of evaluating the test firing by disassembing the booster's nozzle section Engineers found no problems, declaring it `` the best nozzle yet,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. Last week's $ 20 million test culminated <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s 2 -LCB- - year redesign effort For the test, two of the rocket's three field joints _ including the aft joint, the case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint _ were peppered with 14 intentional flaws intended to test the booster's safety features to their limits. The aft joint was the most flawed. Defects included separations in the insulation that holds the joints together, and channels cut to allow the gases to reach the joint's middle O-ring. The O-ring is one of three such seals in each joint designed to contain heat generated by ignition of the rocket's 1.1 million pounds of propellant during launch.

<HEAD>Report: Store Unit 2 For 30 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A report filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> proposes sealing the crippled <ORGANIZATION> Three </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> 2 reactor for 30 years after the conclusion of a $ 1 billion cleanup, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the two nuclear plants on Three Mile Island, said in a statement Thursday the long-term storage of Unit 2 would prevent exposing cleanup workers to radiation. As early as 1986, <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> outlined a plan for mothballing TMI-2. However, the filing of the safety-evaluation report with the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> represents the first time the utility has formally specified a 30-year storage period following the conclusion of the 10-year cleanup, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedell </PERSON>, a company spokesman. The safety report is an elaboration of the earlier proposal, he said. TMI-2 has been shut down since March 1979, when a combination of human and mechanical errors led to a partial melting of the reactor's nuclear fuel. The cleanup at the site is scheduled to end next year. More than 99 percent of the radioactive fuel will be removed from the plant, but some areas will remain too contaminated for human entry. Over a 30-year period, exposure levels for cesium-137, the dominant remaining isotope, would be reduced in half, the report said. `` Although it would be possible to continue decontamination of the facility, this effort would not appreciably enhance the overall stability and maintainability of the facility nor would it add to the overall margin of safety for the public,'' the report said. Further work beyond the end of the planned cleanup `` would result in unnecessary additional occupational exposure to personnel who would be conducting the decontamination tasks,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> officials previously outlined a plan for decommissioning the Unit 2 reactor jointly with its sister plant, TMI-1, when that plant is ready to be retired from service. Decommissioning is the final stage in a plant's life and involves removing a plant from service and ensuring that any residual radioactivity is reduced to levels that permit unrestricted use of the site.

<HEAD>Good News Obscured by Inflation, Rising Interest Rates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with Commerce Department report;
Picks up 3rd graf, `The department ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A rash of worrisome news on inflation and rising interest rates was tempered today by a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that showed Americans' personal income rose at a healthy pace last month but their rampant spending declined. The report said personal incomes climbed 0.6 percent in July, matching a June increase. But personal consumption spending, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, rose 0.5 percent in July, less than half the 1.1 percent rise in June. The slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the economy because of worries that demand for goods is overwhelming supply and pushing up prices, a classic inflation pattern. Other economic reports released Thursday added to worries in the financial markets that inflation is rising. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the economy, overcoming a drag caused by the drought, grew at the surprisingly strong annual pace of 3.3 percent in the April-June quarter. The department also said the growth in the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, would have soared to a 4.3 percent annual clip had it not been for a $ 9.5 billion loss in farm output in a drought-plagued year. In another report, the department said after-tax profits by corporations surged 11.5 percent in the April-June quarter to an annual rate of $ 166.6 billion, the best showing since the same quarter of 1983. But it was the 5.1 percent April-June inflation rate reported by the department, compared with just 1.7 percent in the prior three months, that incited new worries over possible hikes in interest rates by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which boosted rates earlier this month. `` The economy is growing much too fast,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` It is nice to grow fast at the early stages of an expansion when you have an lot of unemployment, but at this stage we just ca n't afford it.'' Aggravating the concern were moves by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other key European trading partners to hike interest rates in their countries, partly to combat what they called the unwelcome effects of a resurgent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. `` Today's step is an important signal which will be understood by the foreign-exchange and capital markets,'' proclaimed West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>. `` It should lead to stabilization of the -LRB- currency -RRB- and capital markets and the first reactions should show this is the case.'' In response, the dollar tumbled against the West German mark and British pound in heavy trading. `` <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> used pretty strong language,'' said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Germans have shown us pretty clearly that they really have n't been happy with the mark at the level it's been.''

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was greeted by a black choir singing his praises today as he toured a shantytown his government tried several times to destroy. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, making one of his few visits to a black township in his 10 years as head of state, was cheered loudly when he arrived at the long-troubled Crossroads area outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` Thank you, we accept you as our leader,'' a choir sang in the Xhosa language. After years of trying to eliminate the squatters' town, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government is now building new houses in <LOCATION> Crossroads </LOCATION> However, the population has changed. Most of the current 120,000 residents are believed supporters of the vigilantes who in 1986 burned down huge areas of Crossroads where anti-apartheid activists held sway. Scores of people were killed and 70,000 squatters burned out of their homes during that factional fighting. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> stopped at a new job-training center where the appointed mayor, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngxobongwana </PERSON>, welcomed him `` in the name of all Crossroads residents.'' <PERSON> Ngxobongwana </PERSON> headed the so-called vigilantes. Many of his displaced opponents have moved where the government wanted them _ a massive township called <LOCATION> Khayelitsha </LOCATION>, further from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Elize </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON>, concluded his visit with a half-hour drive past Crossroads shacks and an area where new homes are being built. Several thousand residents looked on, many cheering, and youths ran after his car when it left a child-care center. At one point, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> inspected a house under construction, and spread mortar with a trowel. Later, he shook the hand of a boy who ran alongside his car. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eck </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said of Crossroads, `` The black community that rejects an Archbishop -LRB- <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and accepts into its midst the oppressor, Mr. <PERSON> P.W </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' He was referring to graffiti on a wall near the main entrance to Crossroads that says: `` No entry for <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'' _ the black Anglican leader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against apartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in national affairs. Crossroads was declared a township last year _ the first time its residents were not classified as squatters. Millions of blacks live in squatter camps elsewhere in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and the government has introduced legislation making it easier for authorities to evict them. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the employment center was an example of his government's attempts to develop black areas. `` To boycott is easy, but it leads nowhere,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told about 200 people in the center. `` To cooperate is sometimes difficult and to take responsibility sometimes difficult. But history remembers only those who build, not those who destroy.'' The center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry, bricklaying, sewing and other skills. The shantytown's troubled history centers around the white-dominated government's former policy that people of mixed-race had preference over blacks for all jobs in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> region and that blacks lived there only as temporary workers. Crossroads was born as a result of the government's attempt to remove several `` black spots,'' where blacks lived illegally. When three such areas were demolished in 1974, residents packed their few possessions and moved, but only as far as an intersection near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s airport. By 1976, Crossroads was a squatter city of 60,000 people, and the government declared it an `` emergency camp.'' Subsequent demolitions and evictions failed to stem its growth. In 1984, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> abandoned the idea that the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> should be a job-preference area for mixed-race people and promised a halt to forced removals for race separation purposes. By 1986, an estimated 200,000 blacks were living in Crossroads' slums when battles broke out between different neighborhoods Residents and community workers said police aided militants from the oldest section of Crossroads who burned down neighborhoods where anti-apartheid activists lived. The <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is hearing the first of at least 3,000 damage suits by those who lost their homes. They charge the police and government with responsibilty.

<TEXT>
 The battered body of a former legislator was paraded through the streets of this medieval town today, one day after he was fatally beaten by political rivals while distributing food and blankets to victims of a killer earthquake. `` Hang the murderers,'' scores of young men chanted as they marched in front of a jeep bearing the body of <PERSON> Karna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON>, once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Officials say the earthquake that rocked parts of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> last Sunday killed at least 869 people, including seven in <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>. Witnesses said <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON> was beaten with umbrellas and sticks Thursday afternoon, then dragged through the streets for two hours before police intervened. He died today at <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, 7 miles west of <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Uttam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhaubanjar </PERSON>, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON> was distributing blankets, milk and other foodstuffs in <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION> when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief materials to his own supporters and ignoring others. `` People started beating him with umbrellas,'' <PERSON> Dhaubanjar </PERSON> said. `` There were a lot of scratches on his body, and a lot of blood. It looked like one ear was missing. Then they made a necklace of their shoes, put it around his neck and pulled him through the streets.'' <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON> served in the assembly from 1981 until 1986 when he lost the backing of the one-time Communists in <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>, traditionally a leftist stronghold. <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, has a population of about 50,000. As <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON>'s body was taken through the winding streets en route to the cremation ground, thousands of people jammed streets, temple steps and balconies of brick and mud houses. Meanwhile, reports of earthquake damage continued to arrive from remote parts of the country today. The Home Affairs Ministry said the confirmed death toll in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> had reached 673. The official death toll in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was 196, but survivors, news media and opposition politicians claim the government tally is far too low and that the actual toll in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> could reach 1,500. Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, which records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion measured by a seismograph. A reading of 6 means the quake can cause severe damage, while 7 signifies a major quake. In another development, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> arrived unheralded Thursday night at <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>'s airport with food for earthquake victims in the Himalayas. While others go through official aid channels, the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winning nun simply flew into the Nepalese capital 550 pounds of powdered milk and tins of biscuits. `` We have to show our love for the people, no?'' the 78-year-old nun said. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, who runs a home for the dying in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said she would consult her fellow nuns of the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> before setting out to meet earthquake victims. Her shoulders hunched, her blue cardigan buttoned to her throat over her blue-bordered white sari, she was ushered into the airport's VIP lounge by a staffer from <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and promptly started asking how one could reach the quake-stricken areas. `` They did n't charge me overweight,'' she said. `` They never do. I always travel with a big amount.'' Several international relief organizations have offered to provide aid for earthquake victims in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, but their representatives in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> said they were still awaiting word from the government on what was needed. Agencies already operating in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, have supplied medical teams and medicine. The British government has sent supplies to eastern <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, the hardest hit region, where it has several projects. RSS, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s official news agency, said Thursday night the Japanese government will provide $ 150,000 worth of tents, blankets, medicine, biscuits and powdered milk. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> provided $ 25,000 in immediate funds available in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> and is awaiting word on further needs. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> provided the same amount for Indian victims of the quake. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> today approved about $ 330,000 in emergency aid for the quake victims. The 12-member trading bloc said in a statement that the money was `` destined to finance internal transportation of international aid and eventually other essential assistance.''

 A 38-year-old man has been indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, on charges that he threatened to have President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other top federal officials killed, while a second man was arrested in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> after making similar threats. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copley </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Herrings </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has criminal charges involving violence on his police record dating back to the 1970s, is also accused of in the indictment of threatening three federal judges, a magistrate and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal in two letters. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, police and the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said today that a man was taken into custody in <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, Thursday evening. The man, who claimed to be from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, made `` threatening statements against the president to police officers, and he was subsequently taken into custody by my agents,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Formal charges were expected to be brought against the man later today, <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> said. The man may be recommended for psychological evaluation, the agent said. Copley's alleged threats against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> directors <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was made orally July 15 while he was being investigated for the letters, according to the indictment, which was handed up Wednesday. The government takes all threats against officials seriously, `` but when a person has a long history of violent offenses, we redouble our efforts,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Copley </PERSON> sent the letters from a cell in the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, where he was serving time for a parole violation, said <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>. The motive for the alleged threats was unclear, he said. <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> said <PERSON> Copley </PERSON> will be examined to determine if he is competent to defend himself against the threat charges. If convicted on all three threats, <PERSON> Copley </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $ 3,000 fine. In <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> said the man arrested Thursday met a truck driver in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and offered him $ 600 for a ride to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The closer they got to <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, the more bizarre this guy's behavior got,'' <PERSON> Ashton </PERSON> said `` He started talking about killing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and blowing up the Pentagon.''

 Residents of several communities in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> were ordered to be ready for possible evacuations as forest fires blazed in the direction of their homes, but half the campgrounds in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> were closed. Fire crews in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also battled wildfires blackening thousands of acres Thursday. In southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a lightning-sparked fire shot flames 100 feet into the sky less than a mile from a subdivision north of Grants Pass, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Aplin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. The blaze doubled in size Thursday to 1,200 acres, prompting state officials Thursday night to order evacuation plans for the subdivision of about 1,000 residents. `` There are ashes falling just like rain on our deck,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, who lives at the Grants Pass city limits, about two miles south of the fire. No evacuations had been implemented yet, fire officials said early today. In northeast <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the growing Ward Canyon fire prompted officials to order evacuation plans for the tiny town of Troy, near the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> line. The blaze expanded to 5,000 acres Thursday, crossing the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ronde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and burning 15 unoccupied structures, mostly hunting cabins, <PERSON> Aplin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Effie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said Troy is a `` motel and a restaurant'' with about 50 residents scattered nearby. In both communities, either state fire officials or the county sheriff could order evacuations if conditions worsened. Forest fires also were burning out of control just east of Grants Pass near the towns of <LOCATION> Rogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Crater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and south of <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Near Grants Pass, firefighters using bulldozers to clear a fire break early Thurday came upon the secluded home of <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, 200 yards from the flames. `` It was just like something out of science-fiction movie,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said. `` At 3 a.m. the floodlights poured in from two giant bulldozers. We are scared out of our wits. We just took pictures of every room of our house and packed our clothes.'' But the house was saved, <PERSON> Aplin </PERSON> said. Residents of <LOCATION> Maxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, a town of two dozen homes about 90 miles southwest of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, were told to prepare for possible evacuation as fire engulfed more than 5,000 acres of heavy timber and forced closure of the main road through the area, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Firefighters battling another 30,000-acre fire in south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> were trying to prevent flames from moving closer to <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silver Gate, two <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> communities near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. `` We have about a 30 to 40 percent chance that we would have to evacuate today'' from <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silver Gate, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON>, incident commander on the Storm Creek fire. The southern edge of the fire was about 4 miles north of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> this morning and a rocky ridge with little vegetation stood between the fire and the town, <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON> said. Strong wind out of the north was forecast today. In central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, a fifth 1,300-acre fire that edged to within a half mile of a Minuteman II missile silo Wednesday continued to burn out of control. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday withdrew crews and equipment it had sent as a precaution. Capt. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Planalp </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Malmstrom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in Great Falls said there never was any danger to the underground silo. Firefighters in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> also battled two other blazes that covered 30,000 and 37,600 acres apiece. In northwest <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, wind was down overnight and fires in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> did not appear to make much overnight progress, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. But she said officials were checking to see if lightning during the night caused any new fires. Six of the park's 12 campgrounds were closed and the west entrance was closed during the early morning. A 108,000-acre blaze in the park moved to within a quarter-mile of the Canyon hotel and campground complex Thursday, but firefighters turned the flames away using backfires, or fires intentionally set to burn up fuel. Park spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> said the threat to the 600 cabins and other buildings in the area abated before sunset. The blaze is one of 10 burning in the nation's oldest national park. Firefighters in the Bridger-Teton and <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> national forests to the south were trying to direct another 19,000-acre fire toward <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s southern border. In eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, officials hoped to contain a wind-whipped, 200-acre fire that briefly threatened a cluster of summer homes in <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hell </PERSON>'s Canyon, an elite fire crew grappled with a spot fire in a huge stand of timber. The blaze, part of a 2,540-acre fire on the <LOCATION> Idaho-Oregon </LOCATION> line, burned in such steep terrain that only a helicopter dumping water from a bucket was used. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, firefighters battled two fires covering more than 750 acres southwest of <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rainier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, and an 80-acre lightning-sparked fire threatened about 15 homes near the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> line. Armed rangers and sheriff's deputies in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> barricaded some 460 square miles, or about 40 percent, of <ORGANIZATION> Stanislaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> because of the fire hazard in the tinder-dry woods. North of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cloverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, firefighters frustrated by wind and steep terrain expected to battle a 1,833-acre fire most of today before stopping its spread. The fire forced about a dozen families to flee before shifting wind moved flames away from their homes.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> are investigating `` suspicious'' damage discovered in some O-ring seals that had been destined for use in space shuttle booster rockets, an official of the manufacturing company said today. None of the damaged O-rings, which were found in June and which appeared to have been deliberately cut, were sent to booster manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON>, vice president of operations for <ORGANIZATION> HydraPak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, company that produces the O-rings. `` During the normal inspection procedures in the manufacturing process ... certain space shuttle O-rings appeared to have received damage of a suspicious origin,'' he said. `` The damaged O-rings were immediately secured, and no damaged O-rings were shipped to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> were advised immediately, and <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said both agencies and <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON> launched investigations. `` Relying upon the results of these investigations, <PERSON> HydraPack </PERSON> has taken steps to prevent similar incidents in the future and is confident the problem now is solved,'' he said. <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said `` some kind of incision'' had been made in the O-rings, but he declined to say how many were damaged or what instrument had been used. He also refused to speculate on a possible motive. None of the company's 85 employees has been dismissed, <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said, but he refused to say if any had been disciplined. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> confirmed the agency has launched an investigation of possible sabotage, a federal violation. But he declined to elaborate. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> is not investigating the incidents because the company never received any damaged O-rings from HydraPak, <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said today. `` It's always upsetting to hear that someone may, for whatever reason, be deliberately damaging stuff that's intended for the space program,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. `` But we are satisfied that the steps taken by <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON> to resolve the situation are, in fact, adequate.'' Because <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> carefully inspects any products from suppliers, and never found any problems with the O-rings, the company is satisfied `` that the situation has resulted in no particular danger,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. `` There is virtually no possibility that any damaged O-ring has ever gotten into the flight hardware,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, which produces the boosters at its <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, on Aug. 18 successfully conducted the final qualifying test of the booster, which had been redesigned in the wake of the 1986 Challenger explosion. The explosion, which killed Challenger's seven crew members and grounded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned space program, was blamed on a faulty booster joint which allowed a plume of fiery gas to escape, igniting the craft's main liquid fuel tank. O-rings are used as seals to prevent the super-heated gases from escaping the joints. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> engineers have redesigned the joints to incorporate a third O-ring and other improvements, including a metal capture feature, have been added. <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON> submits the O-rings to thorough internal inspections, which are followed by inspections by <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> personnel and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The nature of these cuts were such that they could not get past our inspection,'' he said. `` They were very obvious, and there is no fear that -LRB- any damaged O-rings -RRB- left our facility.'' <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said the plant is operated under a strict security system. Among other measures, employees are required to wear badges to gain access to the plant and visitors are always accompanied by an escort. `` We have asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> for a critique on security, and we have not received any criticism,'' he said. `` We are always security-conscious.''

 The Veterans of Foreign Wars rejected <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s apology for her support of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, and passed a resolution asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to try her for treason. At their 89th annual convention Wednesday, about 13,400 VFW delegates passed three resolutions by voice vote, one of which said the apology `` is not enough to redeem the situation.'' `` The VFW is not insensitive to a sincere expression of contrition,'' the resolution stated, `` but the VFW wants to be assured that the ` apology' is not simply a means of bolstering her sagging career and political fortunes.'' The resolution said that in a speech at <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said `` all of us should ` pray' to become communists.'' `` Does her ` apology' mean she also disavows her communist sympathies?'' the resolution asks. The third resolution, passed unanimously by voice vote, accused <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> of committing `` many treasonable actions and statements,'' and called for congress to put her on trial for treason. The resolutions also urged veterans to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to investigate her actions during the war, and denounced `` Union Street,'' a movie that stars <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and was partially filmed in <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, an ardent opponent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, took a highly publicized trip to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> during the war and posed for pictures next to a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun Last June, at her request, she appeared on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program `` 20 @ 20'' to apologize. There was no immediate comment from <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> or her representatives. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, a man answering the phone at the office of <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicita </PERSON>, an agent who works with <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, said spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> was not immediately available. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> was recently in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> filming `` Union Street'' with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeNiro </PERSON>.

 The referee of a basketball game sponsored by drug dealers in a city park was beaten to death over a bad call, according to a report published today.

 Strikers demanding democracy today halted all train and air service in the capital, and rioting prisoners set several buildings ablaze in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s jail. Most government offices were deserted. `` Government control is eroding, but it has not disintegrated,'' said a Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The influential daughter of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s late independence leader spoke before 400,000 cheering protesters and demanded an interim government to bring about democracy and end 26 years of authoritarian rule. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> said this alone could ease weeks of unrest that has toppled one president and killed at least 112 people. In another development, retired Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oo </PERSON> wrote a letter to President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> calling for an interim government, an end to one-party rule and condemned the ruling party for resorting to force. Soldiers and police have virtually disappeared from the streets since the president ended martial law Wednesday. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> since has reported looting, arson and other violence, and said today `` hooligans'' torched shanties in suburban areas. Security forces opened fire to quell prison riots in three cities this week and at least seven inmates were killed, the radio said. It said about 2,000 prisoners torched buildings in Insein Jail eight miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> today. Smoke could be seen eight miles away from the jail, where nearly 1,700 anti-government protesters had been held. Smoke could be seen eight miles away. In <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION>, 290 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, police and government employees joined about 100,000 demonstrators demanding an interim government. Witnesses said it was the largest rally ever in the Shan State capital. Striking workers halted all rail services and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> domestic flights, officials said. Strikes also crippled most factories under the <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and blue-uniformed factory workers riding in the ministry's trucks took part in the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> demonstrations. Strikes shut two oil refineries, in <LOCATION> Syriam </LOCATION> across the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Mann </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. A strike at <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> port also left scores of foreign ships waiting. No newspapers appeared for the second day because workers at the six state-run dailies stayed away to demand democracy and press freedom. People were reported to be hoarding goods as the price of rice soared. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> has no political experience but wields considerable symbolic influence as the daughter of <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, who led the country's struggle for independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and was assassinated in 1947. She spoke a day after the country's most outspoken dissident, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, also demanded an interim government. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> spoke before 200,000 people after he was freed from jail following a month of detention on charges of `` attacking the state.'' <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> asked the military to be `` the people's army'' and look after the people's interests. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> have cited reports of anti-government feeling in the military and said it may intervene to establish an interim government. In riots this month, security forces in some towns reportedly let demonstrators take over local administrations. In an Aug. 18 letter, former teachers of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> urged graduates to side with the people. A copy of the letter was obtained today by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>. `` The D.S.A. did not teach you to wreck the economy of the nation nor did we teachers teach you to kill the people systematically or to apprehend and torture them,'' the letter said. `` The demonstrations and strikes started as the people were starving,'' it said. `` It was not the work of ... rebels.'' Catholic priests and nuns sang hymns to begin today's rally in a field near the revered Shwedagon Pagoda. People of all ages and from all walks of life, including students and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, attended. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said that all 2,750 people arrested during demonstrations Aug. 3 to Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> had been released except those who committed serious crimes. It said those freed included 744 students, 165 government employees, and 27 <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks. All other protesters nationwide have been ordered released, it said. The demonstrations forced hard-line President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s resignation on Aug. 12 and put pressure on <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who took power Aug. 19, to move toward multiparty democracy <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> also is chairman of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people marched in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to demand immediate democracy. They rejected <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s plan to hold a party congress Sept. 12 to consider holding a popular vote on whether to end one-party rule. When Ne Win, 77, resigned July 23 as chairman of the 1.1 million-member party after 26 years in power, he accepted indirect responsibility for bloody student-led riots in March and June and proposed a referendum on multiparty rule. But a special party congress rejected the proposal and selected <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> to succeed him. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former army general blamed for harsh suppression of dissent, took power July 27 and moved quickly against his opposition. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> was arrested two days later in a sweep that also netted this correspondent. Protests against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> turned bloody Aug. 8 when security personnel fired to disperse crowds. The government reported 112 people killed, but diplomats believe the figure was much higher.

 A Puerto Rican nationalist facing trial in the 1983 robbery of $ 7 million from a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot has been rearrested on charges that he shot an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> when he was arrested in 1985, officials said today. <PERSON> Filiberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> on a warrant from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> accusing him of shooting Special Agent <PERSON> Abelardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> on Aug. 30, 1985, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Twardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The indictment against him was handed up in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> survived the attack, which occurred as he and five other agents were seeking to arrest <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> at his home on charges in the Sept. 12, 1983, robbery of the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, according to court documents. More than $ 7 million was stolen in a robbery federal authorities say was masterminded by <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macheteros </ORGANIZATION>, a militant, sometimes violent group seeking Puerto Rican independence. Sixteen people are now awaiting trial in the robbery case. Prosecutors have said <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> was one of the leaders of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>. The 55-year-old <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> was released on $ 1 million bond in May after a pretrial detention lasting 32 months, longer than any other defendant in federal history. An appeals court ruled that the detention violated his constitutional rights. He was released into the custody of his attorney and has been living in a <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> apartment. He was under a judge's order to remain in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, stay at home between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m., and wear an electronic bracelet so authorities could monitor his whereabouts. Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, who has been involved in the <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> defense, has said <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> fired three shots at agents who arrested him in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> because he feared being killed. <PERSON> Alba </PERSON> was struck in the eye by a fragment of a bullet that ricocheted off a wall in the <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> home, authorities said. If convicted of the shooting, <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to 60 years in prison.

 Employees of the second-largest state broadcasting network went on strike Friday, halting several television and radio shows. It was the first labor strike involving a TV or radio network in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The strikers allege the network is biased in favor of the government.

Management said it would stay on the air with the help of 1,400 non-union members, most of them senior news editors and technical crews. Union members said they would start a sit-in to press their demand. The union, whose members include most junior reporters, newscasters and cameramen in the company, alleged the network has been pro-government. Culture and Information Minister <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Han-mo </PERSON> denounced the strike and warned it could hurt the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics Riding on a nationwide political democratization movement, unionized reporters have recently been increasing efforts to expand press freedom.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is seeking support in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with promises to revive the faltering oil industry, oppose gun control and create jobs for minorities through business tax breaks. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ which commands 29 electoral votes, and 270 are needed to win the presidency _ has become a key battleground with the selection of Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as the running mate of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Democratic rival, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention while campaigning Thursday of his beleaguered running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, but he predicted that he will win in his adopted home state in November. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed eager to get on with his campaign after many days of media focus on the background of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Asked by reporters if he thought the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> matter was behind him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Yes, I do.'' However, a new report today in The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer says <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and campaign biography contains inflated claims about his service in the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> attorney general's office. The newspaper reported that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was an entry-level research assistant for most of the time he claims to have been `` chief investigator for the Consumer Protection Division of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Attorney General's Office from 1970-1971.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> focused Thursday on his pitch to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters, and after a warm reception from several hundred supporters at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> rally, he said, `` There does seem to be forward motion.'' On his four-day swing through <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the vice president was heading today to <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> for a rally, and on Saturday will go to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for a speech to a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> group and a Republican fund-raiser. `` I will win in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but I will work hard to do that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters as he left the rally en route to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The campaign stop in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> was tailored to appeal to the region's large Hispanic population. Wearing a loose-fitting shirt called a guayaberra for the occasion, he was welcomed at the downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> front by a banner in Spanish and he was serenaded by a Mariachi version of `` Hail to the Chief.'' In his remarks to the sweltering outdoor rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised `` to help those minorities who have n't really had a shot at the starting line.'' `` The best way to do that in employment is to have urban and rural enterprise zones, a break in that tax structure that will encourage business to locate where those populations are,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I support affirmative action so minorities have a better shot at the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream,'' he said. `` I will be a good president for all Americans.'' At the rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised he would `` put some incentive back into the energy business, into the oil business,'' and said he would resist gun control proposals. In an interview published today by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to back away from earlier promises to deploy the Star Wars missile defense system `` as soon as feasible.'' He indicated that cost would be a factor in determining whether to deploy it. `` I do n't think we yet know what the price tag will be,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` If you went to a full deployment of a full strategic defense, it would be very expensive. What I want to do is to continue research at the levels of funding, essentially, that we have requested.'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the vice president was not shifting his stance on Star Wars and has always supported research on the defense system. She said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has long contended that `` full deployment would be very, very expensive, that we would cross that bridge when we come to it.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled his move to the state in the 1940s, with his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, to begin working in the oil industry. `` I was drawn to this state by two things _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was a place of big opportunity, a can do place, and it was strong in the traditional values, family, faith and peace and patriotism,'' he said. `` I'm proud to be back in my home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' The vice president maintains a formal address at the Houstonian hotel and condominium complex in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> where he is staying during his campaign trip. `` We are getting to be a high-tech state,'' he said, adding that he would help stimulate new business by cutting the capital gains tax and keeping <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` from strangling small business with regulation.''

 Three days of heavy rain caused a river in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to overflow its banks Friday, flooding 6,000 houses and forcing the evacuation of more than 5,000 people in surrounding towns, an official said. No deaths were reported. The river is in <LOCATION> Rumoi </LOCATION>, on the western coast of the northern island of Hokkaido. The evacuees were sent to schools and public halls, said a spokesman for the Hokkaido police. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The flooding damaged streets and bridges, the spokesman said. Parts of six national highways and 32 other roads were closed. A spokesman for the railroad said 105 trains were canceled.

 A bomb exploded under a policeman's car in this northern city Friday, and the mayor of a nearby town said she received telephone threats for her stand against an attack by Basque separatists. The police officer was not in the car when the blast occurred shortly after midnight, ripping apart the front seats, dislodging the engine and shattering nearby windows. No injuries were reported. On Thursday, Basque separatists claimed responsibility for a bombing Sunday that killed two civil guards in <LOCATION> Estella </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> she had been threatened because she engineered the ouster of a town councilor who refused to sign a resolution condemning the bombing. The former councilor belongs to <PERSON> Herri </PERSON> <PERSON> Batasuna </PERSON>, the political wing of the separatist group <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed responsibility for the <PERSON> Estella </PERSON> bombing. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>, whose name stands for Homeland and <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> in the Basque language, seeks independence for the three-province Basque region and <LOCATION> Navarre </LOCATION>, the neighboring region where the civil guards were killed. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mostly civil guard, military and police officers, since taking up arms in 1968.

 Comedian <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s fame is his fortune, and it also should be his wife's, a judge says. Ruling in <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s divorce case, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said this week that <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s `` celebrity good will'' can be counted as an asset in dividing property with the star's wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. `` It is a quantifiable asset, just as in any other profession,'' Ms. <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said.

One of <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON>, said Thursday it was only the second time nationwide a judge in a divorce case had placed a value on celebrity status. A judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last March made a similar ruling regarding actress <PERSON> Marisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Skoloff </PERSON>, who vowed to appeal the ruling, said it was unclear exactly what the value of <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>'s celebrity was from the judge's oral opinion, delivered Wednesday from the bench He said he would have to wait for a written opinion, but added that under his understanding of what the judge had said, Mrs. <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> would be eligible to receive roughly $ 50,000. <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON> is a onetime star of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live'' who has appeared in several movie comedies including `` Wise Guys'' and also stars in a popular series of beer commercials.

 The government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> will appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if a lower tribunal rules that <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> can come home to face an accuser, the chief prosecutor said Friday. Solicitor-General <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> made the statement to reporters after a meeting between Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> and chief legal advisers to study implications of a petition filed by the former president to return when a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister testifies against him in November. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> petitioned the anti-graft court Wednesday to allow him to return so he could defend himself when <PERSON> Baltazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, the former Public Works Minister, gives a deposition on alleged kickbacks by Japanese firms during the previous administration. Last week, the anti-graft court said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had the right to be present and cross-examine <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> if the testimony was to be used in criminal proceedings. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is no relation to the president. But the anti-corruption court stopped short of ordering <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said he will file a motion next week asking the court to reject <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' petition. `` If our position is not upheld, then we will elevate the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said. He added that he expected <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to do the same if the lower court rejects the petition. The government was trying to reconcile `` the demands of the judiciary and the demands of national security,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> cited national security as the main reason for preventing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> from coming back from his exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where he fled after the February 1986 uprising that toppled his 20-year administration. But she has also pledged to abide by the decision of the courts, even if they order <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> home. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said the military has begun preparing security plans in the event that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> returns. Pro-Marcos groups within the armed forces have been responsible for at least two of the half dozen major coup attempts against the Aquino government. Key leaders of those coup attempts remain at large. The Philippine government claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> embezzled up to $ 10 billion during his graft-ridden administration.

 Mourners at the funeral for President <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> were told that dissention and mistrust must be resolved, after the first two presidents of this western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> archipelago have died from violent means. `` We must cooperate with one another,'' said President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON>, who is serving out <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s term which ends this year. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was elected three years ago to succeed <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>'s first president, <PERSON> Haruo </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Remeliik </PERSON>, who was shot to death. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head Aug. 20 in his home in the capital city of <LOCATION> Koror </LOCATION>. The government is withholding results of an autopsy performed Monday to determine whether <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was killed by a gunman or committed suicide. The government will delay releasing the results until they are reviewed by family members and the cabinet, said presidential aide <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Basilius </PERSON>. <PERSON> Remeliik </PERSON> was gunned down outside his home. Three men convicted at trial later were acquitted of murder charges on appeal. `` These two very tragic events have made us search our souls to see if our people can survive in today's world,'' <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON> told the more than 1,000 mourners at the National Congress Building. High Chief <PERSON> Ibedul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbins </PERSON> called for unity and peace among Palauans. `` The people of <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> must work together in unity and cooperate to bring prosperity to our future generations,'' <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. `` We can not afford to lose the cream of our leadership,'' <PERSON> Remengesau </PERSON>, 57, said. `` These are costly lessons that must never again be repeated.'' <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> is a 400-mile-long archipelago about 600 miles east of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and 4,500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Its nearly 15,000 residents inhabit eight of its 200 islands. The island chain, which implemented constitutional government in 1981, is a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> trusteeship with its affairs administered by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' Department of the Interior. It has been seeking a new political status with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that would terminate the trusteeship and make <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> self-governing. <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> was a staunch proponent of a proposed compact of free association under which <PERSON> Palau </PERSON> would receive $ 460 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid during the first 15 years of a 50-year agreement. However, the pact has run into court challenges and an impasse in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on legislation to implement the agreeement. Former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeder </PERSON>, who negotiated the compact with <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> and <PERSON> Remeliik </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Salii </PERSON> `` died for the cause'' of sovereignty and self-determination. `` It is time for healing and forgiveness and that message should be carried as well to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Zeder </PERSON> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freely </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will redouble its efforts `` to bring into reality a freely chosen relationship'' for <PERSON> Palau </PERSON>. `` The way to honor President <PERSON> Salii </PERSON>'s memory is for national reconciliation,'' he said after the two-hour state funeral. <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> was part of a four-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation to the funeral headed by <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, principal deputy assistant secretary of Interior.

<HEAD>Lawyers In Discrimination Suit Say FBI Investigating Them</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is using surveillance and unfounded investigations to intimidate attorneys for 311 Hispanic agents suing the bureau in a class-action discrimination suit, the lawyers charge. But the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant director labels the allegations `` outrageous and repugnant.'' The flurry of charges and counter-charges in court Thursday punctuated the end of the nine-day trial before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>, who said he hopes to render a decision by Oct. 1. Almost 100 witnesses testified. The 311 Hispanic agents joined in the class-action suit contend the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> discriminates in the promotion, discipline and assignment of Hispanics. They seek unspecified damages and changes in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> policies. About 400 _ or 4.3 percent _ of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s 9,400 agents are Hispanic, compared to about 8 percent of the general population. The plaintiffs' attorneys, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, complained Tuesday and Thursday that the bureau has kept watch on them and possibly begun an investigation to discredit them. `` This is the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> last year after 18 years. `` You've heard witness after witness state that the first rule of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is, ` Do n't embarrass the bureau.' That's what this case is doing. It's bringing out the dirty laundry of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' About 40 agents testified that the the bureau transfers Hispanic agents more often to undesirable locations, hands them assignments that are less glamorous or more dangerous, promotes them slower and gives them less recognition for their successes. Witnesses called by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> denied the accusations. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> were notified Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was concerned about a possible security breach in connection with the disappearance of an affidavit from <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' briefcase last month. Someone mailed the affidavit to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> implied the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> stole the document July 29 so it could start an embarrassing investigation. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>: `` The government is attempting to put us in jail, to ruin our legal careers, for representing these men and women of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>.'' But <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> assistant director for <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> and public affairs, said the charge was false and denied an investigation resulted from the affidavit's disappearance. `` They're the ones making a veiled allegation of a document being taken from them,'' he said. `` The idea that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would tamper with attorneys' papers is outrageous and repugnant to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s mission.'' On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Lainie </PERSON> <PERSON> Simion </PERSON> tried to introduce into evidence a document concerning a closed investigation into whether <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> were selling arms to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> did not allow the document into evidence. No charges resulted from the investigation, which <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> dismissed as a groundless intimidation tactic that he said was started after he reesigned from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. An <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> police officer lent credence to the surveillance charges when he testified Thursday that he saw a man hiding in the police garage last April, taking photos through a telephoto lens of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> leaving the courthouse with the lead plaintiff, <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Matt </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. The officer reported the incident to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. A brief investigation revealed nothing, testified <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwein </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office. Perez, the No. 2 agent in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, filed the suit in January 1987.

 A jury began deliberating today whether the Copper-7 intrauterine device caused sterility in a 30-year-old <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> woman. The plaintiffs, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, asked the jury Thursday to penalize Copper-7 maker <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by awarding at least $ 16.5 million, far more than any jury has awarded in 18 similar cases. `` You are going to have the ability to step right into that board room and send a message ...,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>, the Kociembas' attorney, told the jury `` Maybe they'll learn a lesson.'' <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>, who spearheaded litigation against <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> that resulted in a settlement of $ 38 million for 198 users of the Dalkon Shield IUD, maintained during the three-month trial that the Copper-7 caused pelvic inflammatory disease that rendered Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> sterile. The Chicago-based <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> improperly tested the device, he argued. `` The Copper-7 was a time bomb ticking away in women's wombs,'' <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> told the jury. `` <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> knew and concealed the dangers of that device from the medical community.'' But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Strain </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, said the company exceeded <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requirements in marketing Copper-7, which was once the most widely used IUD in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He attacked the credibility of the plaintiffs' witnesses and said <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> did not even prove that Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> suffered from pelvic infection, let alone that it was caused by the Copper-7. `` Time and again the <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> doctors did more than they had to do to ensure the safety of the women who were going to use the Copper-7,'' <PERSON> Strain </PERSON> said. `` The medical literature fortifies the judgment that the Copper-7 is safe and effective.'' Strain termed `` raw and mean'' allegations that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> concealed evidence about the Copper-7 `` to hurt women'' and said one expert witness for the other side had testified in many trials and `` would always blame an IUD unless a woman had a gunshot wound to the abdomen.'' Strain cautioned the jury to base its decision on facts instead of sympathy for Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, who wept quietly for much of the day.

<HEAD>Tentative Accord Reached Covering Former PSA Attendants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After months of wrangling that included a job action which forced 170 flight cancellations, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and its flight attendants' union have hammered out a tentative agreement on wage parity for former <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> attendants. Officials for the airline and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the accord also extends for another year, with some minor modifications, a contract covering a total of 4,203 attendants. The current contract was up for renewal and amendment Sept. 1. The new contract, which has to be ratified by the union members, was reached late Thursday in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> after 10 days of intense negotiations there, said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, an official of the Association of Flight Attendants. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> in May 1987 but operated it as a separate subsidiary until last April before merging the two operations. The 961 former <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> attendants had been represented by the Teamsters but voted to switch to the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> just prior to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of PSA. Stack said the former <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> attendants generally were on pay scales about 10 percent less than those at <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>. The company had offered to bring the two groups of workers to parity over a three-year period. The union had wanted that accomplished faster. When the two sides reached an impasse last spring, many attendants refused to work overtime on the Memorial Day weekend, forcing <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> to cancel some 170 flights then. Neither Stack nor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the airline, would disclose details of the agreement. They said completion of the ratification vote is expected in late September. The union and the company now have to go through the same process to integrate a contract covering some 3,000 flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> accord. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> purchased <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> last November and hopes to merge their operations next March.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will try to remove the last major hurdle to restoring relations when they meet this weekend to discuss <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. `` The major obstacle in the way of normalizing Sino-Soviet relations is the Kampuchean -LRB- Cambodian -RRB- question,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guihua </PERSON> said Thursday. `` This obstacle must be removed before ... relations can be normalized.'' The talks between Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> and his Chinese counterpart <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zengpei </PERSON> are to begin Sunday. It will be the first time the two sides have met solely to discuss <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, backed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has occupied <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1979. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supports the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, one of three guerrilla groups in the opposition. `` The talks will concentrate on how to press <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to withdraw all its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> at an early date,'' <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said at the weekly briefing. `` We hope that the talks will achieve positive results to contribute to the improvement of relations between our two countries,'' he said. <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> is to arrive in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Saturday. The world's two largest communist countries split over ideological and strategic differences in the early 1960s. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have met every other year since 1982 to discuss normalizing relations and have encouraged a steady increase in trade and cultural contacts. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has consistently held that three obstacles stand in the way of normalization: Soviet support of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, Soviet military presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and Soviet troops stationed along the Chinese border. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, in a meeting Thursday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said Soviet support for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> blocks normalized political ties The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has already taken steps to remove the other two obstacles by beginning a withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in May and reducing troop strength along the Chinese border with Soviet ally <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which backs the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and other forces fighting Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which gives the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> government financial support, must use its influence to end <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and ousted the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> who killed hundreds of thousands of people during its four-year rule. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed in May to withdraw 50,000 troops this year and remove all its forces by 1990. It also has endorsed recent talks between the anti-Vietnamese resistance coalition and the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. The success of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> talks would also pave the way for the first Sino-Soviet summit since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1959. Both Chinese senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have expressed interest in a summit, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> refuses to participate in a meeting until <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> pressures <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 The death of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlan </PERSON>, a local radio commentator known as `` Joe Question,'' apparently was caused from poison in his breakfast cereal, police said. <PERSON> Merlan </PERSON>, 75, died Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He had spent 10 days in the intensive care unit at the hospital before he died of multiple heart attacks, his son <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlan </PERSON> said. Police Detective <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Merlan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Wilma </PERSON>, 80, were hospitalized Aug. 15 after they ate bran cereal containing a pesticide. Mrs. <PERSON> Merlan </PERSON> was discharged a few days later. `` We're looking at it as a suspicious death and we're trying to find out how -LRB- the poison -RRB- got there,'' <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON> said. An autopsy was planned. <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON> said the cereal was bought in bulk from a local store. `` Nobody seems to think the poison came from the wholesaler,'' he said. There have been no other cases reported, and investigators believe <PERSON> Merlan </PERSON>'s death was an isolated case. Investigators identified the poison as a pesticide sold as Temik and said it is federally restricted and available only to licensed users. <PERSON> Merlan </PERSON> was not licensed, <PERSON> Dietz </PERSON> said. The officer said the cereal was kept in a jar that might have previously contained the poison, but no other traces of it have been found. As <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Question </PERSON>, <PERSON> Merlan </PERSON> had been host of a call-in talk show for various radio stations in the area since about 1970.

<TEXT>
 The Iranian envoy took a hard line today at the second day of the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> peace talks, saying a lasting settlement to the prolonged dispute depends on observance of a 1975 border treaty repudiated by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The joint face-to-face session between foreign ministers was temporarily abandoned this morning. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said it was difficult for the bitter rivals to continue meeting. They met instead in separate rooms for about two hours. But in the afternoon, the face-to-face session was resumed by Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, flanked by their delegations. There was no immediate word on progress. However, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> delivered a strong statement after the morning session about the validity of the 1975 Algiers Treaty on Iran-Iraq boundaries. The issue poses a major stumbling block in the negotiations. Emerging from the morning session, <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters, `` For reaching this comprehensive, just and honorable solution, we have valid criteria ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Resolution 598, -LRB- the -RRB- outline plan of the secretary-general and the 1975 treaty between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' In September 1980, President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> renounced that treaty, which gave <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rights to the disputed Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, and five days later invaded <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The border issue and treaty are considered critical to a peace settlement because Resolution 598 requires troop withdrawal to mutually recognized boundaries. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> now says the boundaries are in question. Iraqi officials recently reaffirmed their repudiation of that treaty. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told reporters that problems between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have lasted centuries, `` and then it is not in one afternoon that we can decide.'' The session began Thursday with a joint session led by the secretary-general, and both sides addressed each other through intepreters. It was the first face-to-face meeting of foreign ministers since the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war began almost eight years ago. But after two hours the session was suspended, and both sides met in separate chambers for three more hours, with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials meeting them and reporting to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. The format of separate rooms was continued today, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. The secretary-general first met separately with each minister, then the delegations consulted in separate rooms, he said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials, based in another room, occasionally visited the delegations and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> at times met the delegations separately. Meanwhile, a small group of Iraqi Kurds and other Iraqi opposition groups demonstrated outside the building and protested the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government's use of chemical weapons on its rebellious Kurdish minority. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had demanded the direct, face-to-face talks before a cease-fire to test <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s intentions. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> refused and both sides agreed on direct talks shortly after the halt in hostilities. `` I am sure the parties sincerely want to solve the problem,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said today. `` -LRB- But -RRB- I think we have to be a little patient.'' He said the arrangement was made at the request of the two countries. `` I would prefer to have them all the time in the main room with me.'' But, he said, `` I have to accommodate myself to the wish of the parties.'' The talks began about one hour late. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> declined to answer questions from reporters at the entrance of the building. The bulk of the Iranian delegation had arrived earlier, on time for the meeting. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> denied reports by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials that the secretary-general was considering appointing former Swiss President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Furgler </PERSON> as his special representative to continue the Iran-Iraq talks. He also dismissed a <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> report that <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, the No. 2 in the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, would be appointed. He said if <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> is appointed <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` There is no question of the secretary-general appointing him as his personal representative,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> is being considered for the post, but if appointed, he would not take the position until next year. The peace process is expected to be long and difficult, possibly lasting years. The direct talks were made possible after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> both accepted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 598, calling for a cease-fire. Before the talks began, Perez de Cuellar held several meetings with <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The warring sides agreed to hold direct talks following a cease-fire that began Aug. 20. The truce appeared to be holding. <PERSON> Saeem </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahmawi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the 350 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers monitoring the 733-mile Iraq-Iran warfront, said in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> there have been no major violations. The Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> include political figures, military representatives and legal experts on war relief, prisoner repatriation and reparations. The agenda was not disclosed, but the secretary-general said the talks were aimed at carrying out the cease-fire resolution, which also calls for troop withdrawal to international boundaries, return of war prisoners, reparations and a comprehensive peace. It also calls for an impartial body to determine which side started the war. Repatriation of POWs is any thorny issue. Many of the 80,000 war prisoners are expected to refuse repatriation because they have publicly supported the detaining country.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace activists announced Friday they are forming an international campaign to secure the release of all political prisoners in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after two Americans were arrested for participating in a recent <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> rally. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> of the People's <ORGANIZATION> Anti-War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobilization </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based group that opposes the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, also called for the withdrawal of the 45,000 American troops stationed there. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> told a news conference that she and another American, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheiner </PERSON>, were arrested Aug. 20 at a rally held five days earlier by supporters of the movement to unify North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` I was surrounded by plainclothes police on foot,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` They began screaming at us, forcibly grabbed us, picked us up and threw us in the back seat of unmarked cars.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> maintains that she and <PERSON> Scheiner </PERSON> were held by the <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and by immigration authorites for 55 hours without being allowed to contact <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials, and then were deported without being charged with a crime. South Korean government officials told embassy representatives that <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scheiner </PERSON> violated laws prohibiting tourists from participating in political demonstrations, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> also contends that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Sook </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> woman who had served as her hostess and interpreter, was jailed after authorities charged she was associating with political subversives. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, said her interpreter's jailing is meant to have a chilling effect on South Korean political activists. `` Clearly, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government is intent on making an example out of <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Sook </PERSON> as a way to discourage contact between the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government and the international community,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. Several international human rights organizations, as well as former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, are working to secure <PERSON> Sook </PERSON>'s release, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials did not have information on <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Sook </PERSON>'s case, and calls to the South Korean embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were not returned immediately.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> should make a full recovery from an operation in which part of his colon was removed as a precaution against cancer, aides and his doctor said. `` We obviously think this will be a short-term problem, but we feel as the senator recovers and returns to work he will demonstrate his vigor and vitality,'' <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, said Thursday after the surgery. The 80-year-old <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> Democrat has served in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> since 1960, when he won a special election, and is running for re-election this year to a fifth full term. He faces Republican <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> in November. An 18-inch section of <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>'s colon was removed during a 2 -LCB- - hour operation at <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, and the procedure was a `` complete success,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON>, who performed the surgery No cancer was apparent in the excised colon tissue, but tests will determine if any was present, the doctor said in a telephone interview. Three polyps were removed from <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>'s colon during a routine screening in July and one was found to be cancerous, according to a statement issued by <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>'s office. There was a slight chance the cancer could have spread to his lymph nodes, so the section of the colon where the cancerous polyp was found was removed as a precaution, <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> said. Following the surgery, <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> was conscious and appeared `` normal for an 80-year-old man after a major operation,'' the doctor said. <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> is expected to remain in the hospital for seven to 10 days and resume a full schedule Sept. 7, <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said. The operation was similar to one President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> underwent in July 1985, when two feet of his colon was removed, <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> has tried to deflect talk about his age and health with a public relations campaign emphasizing his commitment to fitness. He has been photographed wearing a karate outfit and once offered to fight the candidates for the Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nomination `` toe to toe, any rules you want.'' Party activists last year urged <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> to step down because of his age in favor of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bid by Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, D-N.D. <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON> rejected the idea and eventually won the party's endorsement after <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> declined to challenge him

 Equipment trucks caused massive traffic jams and craftsmen spent a week of sleepless nights setting up, but the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> opera company of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is ready to open its second tour of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, its director said Friday. The Milan-based troupe opens Thursday in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in an expensive tour that director <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandini </PERSON> hopes will promote Italian opera culture throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> almost all theaters are state-run, with considerable support coming from the government,'' <PERSON> Bandini </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` If only the Japanese music scene could receive more assistance from the state.'' The month-long, 16-performance tour includes renditions of <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Nabucco,'' `` I Capulet E I Montecchi'' by <PERSON> Bellini </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Puccini </PERSON>'s `` La Boheme'' and `` Turandot.'' Noted conductors <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Muti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lorin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> are conducting the operas. The casts are led by baritone <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruson </PERSON>, tenor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorsky </PERSON>, bass <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Plishka </PERSON>, and sopranos <PERSON> Mirella </PERSON> <PERSON> Freni </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ghena </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Galia </PERSON> <PERSON> Savova </PERSON>. Film director <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeffirelli </PERSON> designed the sets for `` La Boheme'' and `` Turandot.'' `` <PERSON> Teatro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alla </PERSON> <PERSON> Scala </PERSON>,'' known for the grandeur of its huge sets, sent more than 63 containers of sets, props and equipment that along with instruments and other supplies required 150 trucks. `` When they delivered their loads from <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> they caused a massive traffic jam,'' said <PERSON> Tadatsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the tour's promoter. `` It's taking 900 people to set everything up. Most of the performances will be in two halls in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, with two performances in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>. The performing arts foundation flew more than 550 performers, musicians and machinists from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, housing them, paying part of their salaries and giving each a daily allowance of about $ 200. It is also hiring about 200 extras from the local foreign community to fill out crowd scenes. The tour is costing the promoter about $ 16.5 million, said <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON>. But the yen's dramatic rise means this is 2.2 billion yen today, compared with 4 billion yen three years ago. Still, <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON> says he expects to take a loss. `` We expect to cover only 1 billion yen -LRB- $ 7.5 million -RRB- of the cost through ticket sales,'' he said. `` We'll try to cover the rest from <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> and some kind of assistance from arts foundations and such.'' Unlike most operas and musicals that tour <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Scala </PERSON> is not receiving Japanese corporate sponsorship. Offers came from `` seven firms ranging from a pharmaceutical producer to a company that makes rice cookers,'' <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON> said. `` But I did n't want a firm to utilize culture just for their own publicity or to improve their image.'' In <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, ticket sales cover about 30 percent of the cost and the government pays the rest, <PERSON> Bandini </PERSON> said. Opening night tickets back home go for $ 750, but the top tickets usually are about $ 150, he said. Tickets for the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> performances cost from $ 90 to $ 263. If they cost any more, people could not afford to come, he said. `` The Cultural Affairs Agency is not contributing a single yen,'' <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON> said. `` But they sure are asking for a lot of complimentary tickets.''

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court today upheld contempt fines against the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> for defying an order to desegregate housing but capped the penalties at $ 1 million a day, diminishing the threat of bankruptcy. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> also upheld contempt fines against the four City Councilmen who voted against the desegregation plan. Previously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> imposed fines on the city of $ 100 that would double daily, quickly going into the millions and breaking the city's annual budget in less than a month. In a 39-page opinion, the appeals court also delayed reimposition of the fines for seven days to permit the city to seek an appeal before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Yonkers Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON>, who favors accepting Sand's order, did not immediately return a telephone call today seeking comment on the ruling Under the new timetable, if the contempt continues, <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> would pay $ 12,800 next Friday and would reach the $ 1-million-a-day cap a week after that, at which time the city would have paid more than $ 2.6 million in all. The total would mount by $ 1 million each day after that. The <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> budget for the year, $ 337 million, would be wiped out in about 11 months, but the city would face bankruptcy long before that. A state agency has already taken over the city's pursestrings, imposing spending restrictions and drafting a worst-case plan Sand also imposed $ 500-a-day fines against the four councilmen and ordered their eventual jailing if they continued to balk at complying with his ruling. Those sanctions were suspended Aug. 9 when the city and the four councilmen appealed to the 2nd Circuit. If they had not been, the council members were scheduled to go to jail Aug. 11. By Aug. 9, the city had paid $ 12,700 in fines and each councilman had paid $ 3,500. In upholding the fines against the four councilman, the three-judge appeals panel said the threat of jail would resume in nine days. The four councilmen had indicated Thursday they would again vote once again to defy the courts at a special <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting set for 2 p.m. today. The defiant council members said they had n't changed their minds about the desegregation plan, which would create 800 units of affordable housing throughout the city. Sand, who in 1985 found <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> liable for 40 years of segregated housing and schooling, imposed the fines Aug. 2 after the Council refused by a 4-3 vote to endorse the housing plan. The city had argued that Sand's contempt finding and fines were unfairly punishing <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> for the defiance of `` renegade'' council members who would not change their votes because of the political consequences. Lawyers for the council members, in turn, argued that Sand exceeded his judicial discretion by ordering members of legislative body to vote a certain way. But the 2nd Circuit concluded that `` under the circumstances of this case, the recalcitrant council members may be required to vote to implement the consent judgment, and that the city, in addition to the council members, may be ... subjected to coercive sanctions for failure to abide'' with Sand's orders. The court ruled that Sand `` acted well within'' his discretion in starting the fines against the city at $ 100 a day, but added that `` at some point, however, the doubling reaches unreasonable proportions.'' The appeals court noted: `` under the current schedule the fine for day 25 is more than $ 1 billion; the fine for day 30 is more than $ 50 billion.'' The panel said the doubling fines were excessive `` when the level of each day's fine exceeds $ 1 million.''

 Scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> have determined the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, said to be the burial cloth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, is a fake, the <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today. The newspaper claimed radiocarbon dating tests prove the shroud was made in about 1350 A.D. The 14-foot cloth, kept in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> Cathedral, bears the image of a bearded, crucified man. The Evening Standard gave no attribution for its report but quoted Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Magdalene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, as saying: `` I think that as far as seems possible the scientific argument is now settled and the shroud is a fake. `` I suppose there will be certain people who will never want to believe it, but it seems unlikely these tests could be 1,300 years'' off, <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> was quoted as saying. An official at <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> said <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> had left a message saying he would n't be giving interviews. <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON>, whose university is an ancient rival of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, was not connected with the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> tests, but he has been associated with investigations of its history and examined it in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> in 1973. Tests also were made at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. All three institutions agreed to keep their findings secret to enable the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to announce the results in September or early October. Professor <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, the liasion between Cardinal <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> and the three laboratories, said today he had received no word from <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and was `` amazed'' by the report. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> scientists made blind-tests on three samples. `` They were asked to date the three samples, not to determine which of them belongs to the shroud,'' he said. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> confirmed the Oxford experiments were completed, but he said the results would n't be released until after scientists from the three laboratories had met to coordinate them. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tite </PERSON>, who supervised the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> tests, said: `` The results from all three centers are now in and are being coordinated. We are not saying anything because an announcement will be made in September or early October by <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> press office.'' Tite, keeper of the British Museum's research laboratory, stressed that while each laboratory received three samples of cloth, they were not told what they were and samples were taken from the shroud and from medieval and other cloths. `` It was blind testing,'' he said. The announcement of the results is expected from <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON>, who authorized thumbnail-size samples to be cut from the shroud. At <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>'s Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, where the tests were made, a woman on the staff who would not give her name said: `` No data has been disclosed by this laboratory.''

<TEXT>
 More than a week of labor unrest is putting pictures of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and striking Polish workers back into newspapers and on television screens. Here, in question-and-answer format, is some background on the unrest:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Q. What are the issues this time? A. In the approximately 20 strikes since Aug. 16, the chief demand has been to make legal the banned trade union Solidarity, followed by calls for higher wages. Solidarity was suppressed and then outlawed following the imposition of martial law in Dec. 13, 1981. But it has remained active, at first mainly as an underground organization but in recent years more openly as the government has become less restrictive. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s faltering economy has given new impetus to strike actions, and when strikes broke out in April and again this month, Solidarity activists led the protests.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Q. What is the state of the economy? A. The government this year launched its `` second stage'' of economic reform that aims to reduce government subsidies, eliminate inefficient enterprises, give managers more autonomy, remove obstacles to private enterprise and make wages more dependent on individual performance. Broad price increases were announced as part of the program, which sent inflation rocketing from about 25 percent a year to about 60 percent. Wages were raised, too _ even higher than inflation according to the government _ but many workers felt that their incomes have not kept up with prices. Meanwhile, supplies of consumer goods to the stores have been even more erratic than usual, partly because of adjustments to the reform program. After a wave of strikes in April and May, the government announced the price-increase program had been handled poorly and its top priority now would be controlling inflation and improving the availability of consumer goods.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Q. What are the workers' complaints? A. Average wages in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are low, about $ 100 a month at the official rate of exchange. Many industrial workers say they are forced to work long hours and on weekends just to make ends meet. About two pounds of meat costs about one day's wages and a color television about four months' wages. Young workers, who have dominated the strikes, want affordable housng. The waiting period for cooperative apartments can be 20 to 30 years in some parts of the country and private housing is beyond their means. After Solidarity was crushed, the government set up an official trade union federation which has shown some militancy on behalf of workers. But because the head of the federation is a member of the ruling Politburo and it tends to be dominated by the party, many workers do not trust the federation and want Solidarity restored.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Q. What does Solidarity want? A. Legal status and talks with the government about restoring the economy. Solidarity says econmic reform is necessary but it should be done with the consent and guidance of the workers. But even Solidarity admits that many of the goals of the reform require sacrifices. While the union wants to encourage economic reform, it also wants to preserve aspects of the socialized economy that benefit workers: subsidized housing, generous vacations and cradle-to-grave security.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Q. Why wo n't the government recognize Solidarity? A. The government says Solidarity started out with broad popular support but was hijacked by radicals who oppose <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist system and is supported by money from abroad. It says the `` former union'' is now a wholly political group with only about 30,000 supporters nationwide, compared with 10 million members in 1981. The new official unions, with 7 million members, are the legitimate representatives of workers, it says. The government says it is willing to talk to former Solidarity members who are interested in constructive change, but not while they are leading illegal strikes and not if they oppose <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Constitution, which gives the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> the `` leading role'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Q. What is <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s role? <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> is Solidarity's national chairman and is keeping in touch with strikers nationwide while leading the strike at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where he works as an electrician. He has advisers with him in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, including some intellectuals like historian <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>. Other Solidarity activists are running a nationwide information network to make sure the union's side of the strike is publicized.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Q. Why is 1988 different from 1980? A. Strikes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this year have not sparked the same degree of public enthusiasm as in 1980, when virtually the entire nation went on strike and an unbridled national euphoria gave rise to Solidarity. After the experience of martial law and eight years of economic decline, the attitude expressed by many Poles, even among some sympathetic to Solidarity's goals, is `` Strikes are useless. What good will it do?''

<TEXT>
 A federal judge today extended his earlier action to bar <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from firing 4,000 workers and said he would detail his objections to the company's reorganization and cutback plans by Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> issued a terse, two-page ruling saying that the three unions fighting <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s plans `` are entitled to preliminary injunctive relief. The financially troubled airline, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said it anticipated an appeal of <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s actions. The scope of the ruling was not immediately clear. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s ruling said a full opinion would be issued setting forth `` the limits of the the preliminary injunctive relief. Earlier this month, the judge issued a restraining order blocking the carrier's plans to reduce its service and close its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub Sept. 1 A spokeswoman for the Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>, said in a statement that the company believes the unions `` are not entitled to relief of any sort and we expect we will be filing an appeal at the appropriate time.'' The statement said the airline would take no action against the employees `` pending clarifications of what our obligation will be under terms of the ruling.'' The Eastern plan, announced July 22, also calls for elimination of 140 of its 1,225 daily flights to trim costs. The three unions _ the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> _ contend the layoffs ca n't take place until the carrier negotiates with its employees under the Railway Labor Act. Eastern, which has lost about $ 1 billion over the last decade, says the cuts are necessary to prevent further losses. The unions allege the reductions are a part of a plan to move <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, another subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. At a hearing before <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> earlier this month, union attorneys produced a draft of a speech that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> acquired Eastern The draft said the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> a better bargaining position against its unions. `` Eastern's airplanes can be repainted and moved over to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, where they will be flown by non-union pilots,'' the speech draft said. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the draft was prepared by an investment banking firm. It was unclear from court testimony whether <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> ever delivered that portion of the speech.

<HEAD>President Botha Cheered in Visit to Troubled Shantytown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CROSSROADS, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was cheered and serenaded Friday as he toured a black shantytown once targeted for demolition and now being upgraded following battles that ousted anti-apartheid activists. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who has visited only a handful of black towns during his 10 years in power, opened a new job-training center for the township near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and inspected a housing project on land formerly controlled by squatters who opposed the government. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> extolled the example set by appointed mayor, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngxobongwana </PERSON>, the leader of the `` vigilantes'' from the oldest section of Crossroads who burned out the militant squatters in 1986. `` I'm encouraged by your positive attitude, which can serve as an example ... for other communities to get similar facilities,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. He stopped at a job-training center where <PERSON> Ngxobongwana </PERSON> welcomed him `` in the name of all Crossroads residents.'' The president briefly played a xylophone and listened while a choir sang in his honor, `` Thank you _ we accept you as our leader.'' Scores of people were killed and 70,000 squatters left homeless during the 1986 factional fighting. The conflict left <LOCATION> Nxgobongwana </LOCATION> in control, and last year Crossroads was declared a township _ the first time since it was established in 1974 that its residents were not classified as squatters. Millions of blacks live in squatter camps elsewhere, and the government has drafted legislation making it easier for authorities to evict them. The government is building new homes for some of <PERSON> Ngxobongwana </PERSON>'s supporters, who make up a majority of Crossroads' estimated 120,000 residents Many of his displaced opponents have moved where the authorities wanted them, into a vast township called <LOCATION> Khayelitsha </LOCATION>, farther from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Elize </PERSON>, and daughter, <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON>, concluded his visit with a half-hour drive past Crossroads' shacks. He inspected a house under construction, and spread mortar with a trowel. Later, he shook the hand of a boy who ran alongside his car. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said the employment center exemplified his government's attempts to develop black areas `` To boycott is easy, but it leads nowhere,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told about 200 people in the center. `` To cooperate is sometimes difficult and to take responsibility sometimes difficult. But history remembers only those who build, not those who destroy.'' The center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry, bricklaying, sewing and other skills. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said 800,000 people have been trained at such facilities since 1984. `` I hope those who are only trying to belittle our country will also come and see what can be done if they leave us alone,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., on a five-day South African visit, made a simultaneous tour of Crossroads He is a strong supporter of economic sanctions to protest <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policies of racial segregation. Since Crossroads began to grow in 1974, it was visited regularly by police, bulldozers and eviction agents. Each time the shacks were smashed, they reappeared in a different sandy field. Each time truckloads of women and children were driven away to rural homelands, separated from their menfolk who worked in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, thousands more families arrived. By 1986, an estimated 200,000 blacks lived in its slums. `` Crossroads at a certain stage was seen almost as the starting point of the revolution,'' Information Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said Thursday. `` It is significant that the state president is visiting there and no abnormal security will be necessary. It is symbolic.'' Its troubled history centered around the government's former policy that mixed-race people had preference over blacks for jobs in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> region, and that blacks lived there only as temporary workers. Crossroads was born as a result of the government's attempt to remove several `` black spots'' where blacks lived illegally. In 1984, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> abandoned the idea that the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> should be a job-preference area for mixed-race people and promised a halt to forced removals for separation purposes. Raids and demolitions continued under slum clearance and anti-squatting laws. A <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> court is hearing the first of more than 3,000 damage suits by those who lost their homes in 1986. They contend police helped the vigilantes. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eck </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said of Crossroads, `` The black community that rejects an Archbishop -LRB- <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and accepts into its midst the oppressor, Mr. <PERSON> P.W </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' He was referring to graffiti near the main entrance to Crossroads that says: `` No entry for <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'' _ the black Anglican leader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid campaign.

<HEAD>Tokyo Exchange Says Employees Bought Stock After Deal Leaked</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that 34 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seiki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> bought more than 68,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> stocks before the companies announced a major deal. `` There was apparently a leak of insider information,'' said <PERSON> Takao </PERSON> <PERSON> Nojiri </PERSON>, a senior managing director of the exchange. `` We will issue a strict warning to both companies and request them to submit their report on the cause of the leak and measures they will implement to avoid recurrence of such a case.'' Fifteen workers of <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION>, a precision-machinery maker, and 19 workers of <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest steel maker, each purchased an average of 2,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> as early as four months before the announcement, the exchange said. After markets closed July 29, the companies announced an agreement on <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of a large stake of <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION>. About a week before the announcement, the share price of <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> began skyrocketing. The exchange suspected major insider trading and launched an unusually thorough investigation. On the day of the announcement, volume of <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> shares traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> soared as much as 10 times the previous day's, leading the exchange to take an unusual measure of suspending the transaction of <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> shares in the afternoon session. Under the current Japanese securities law, neither the companies nor workers will be a subject of criminal charges. Scandals involving stock dealings in recent months intensified pressure on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market to upgrade its ethical standards to that of the Western countries and forced the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to revise the Securities and Exchange Law. Parliament recently passed a law allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the exchange a greater investigatory power. The law was partially implemented Tuesday. A provision enabling securities authorities to press criminal charges on insider trading will not take effect until next April. `` We have to implement the new law step by step to make it work,'' said <PERSON> Kazuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Futagawa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s securities bureau. The exchange also said some of the 34 employees of <LOCATION> Nippon </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sankyo </ORGANIZATION> were directly involved in coordinating the agreement, but officials refused to give the exact number and their names. `` Under the current law, those individuals did not violate any law and we can not say they were involved in insider trading,'' said <PERSON> Nojiri </PERSON>. `` The purpose of our investigation is not to pinpoint the people but to find out if there was a lack of appropriate control of information within those companies and make them to correct it,'' he said. <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimakura </PERSON>, the exchange's director of the transaction review department, said some of the employees bought more than 5,000 shares before the deal was announced. But he added: `` We would rather not go into details of what individuals did.'' He also said the exchange will not release the names of individuals to their employers. Nippon president <PERSON> Yutaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON> met the chairman of the exchange, <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, on Thursday and expressed regret for his employees' wrongdoing.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> is scrapping its employee suggestion program until somebody can suggest a more economical way to run it. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> set up the program last fall to encourage cost-saving ideas, but the operation cost the federal utility more to administer than it saved. `` The idea of the program was good, but what we ended up with was a bureaucratic, convoluted system that took so long to review the suggestions that it proved to be ineffective,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, acting director of <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s human resources department. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> received nearly 1,000 suggestions from employees over 10 months, including 46 that collectively saved about $ 580,000. Ten percent of that savings was paid to the employees as a bonuses for their ideas. The problem was that <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> spent about $ 700,000 on the program, including $ 514,000 in staff expenses, said Ms. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>. Among other things, there was a two-inch-thick handbook of rules specifying who and what could be included in the program to qualify for the bonuses. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> directors voted earlier this week to end the program, and a group of managers and employees is working on a new system.

<HEAD>Sweden: Haven For Refugees, Sanctuary For Spies</HEAD>

 Swedes are proud to have sheltered political refugees from all over the world, but now they're finding their hospitality abused by spies and terrorists, officials say. Fifteen or 20 international terrorists may be moving to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> every year to find sanctuary under false identities, police say. They are among thousands of immigrants or refugees seeking asylum. `` The many terrorists we have in this country is the price we pay for our open society,'' said <PERSON> Krister </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, head of the anti-terrorist section of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. In a recent book titled `` Espionage in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>,'' several leading defense writers claim that neutral <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> is becoming a playground in the game of East-West espionage. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> keeps about 100 agents here, while the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> has about 10, the book said. This week, Swedish police arrested two Hungarian-born Swedes suspected of being couriers for an international spy ring working against <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The ring is alleged to be headed by a former American army sergeant in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kercsik </PERSON>, 48, and <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kercsik </PERSON>, 34, were arraigned in court Friday. Prosecutors said they came to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in the 1960s. Both doctors, they prospered and were well-liked by their neighbors, who said they were stunned to learn that the brothers were agents of the Hungarian intelligence service. In another case this summer, police raided the home of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> businessman and uncovered documents indicating he was a senior commander of the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> terrorist organization. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> married a Finnish-born Swede and moved here two years ago. He traveled frequently, but led an otherwise unremarkable life in a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> suburb. In July, <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> was blown apart by a bomb in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. The explosion was linked to an assault by a terrorist squad a few hours later on the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise ship which killed nine people and wounded about 90. Before leaving on his fatal mission, <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> had stashed away a supply of weapons in a forest north of <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, which police said could have been used to attack the nearby <LOCATION> Arlanda </LOCATION> international airport or an embassy in the city. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Svenska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper this week that eight of every 10 people seeking political asylum arrive at <LOCATION> Arlanda </LOCATION> airport without passports, and police can not be sure who they really are. After years of large-scale immigration, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> may have 25,000 residents whose real identities are unknown, he said. Many could be common criminals. `` It is not generally done to have a security check'' on prospective immigrants, said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's up to the police to decide.'' A newcomer is asked his name and birth date, is photographed and fingerprinted, and within hours can have a new identity. Last year, 16,000 people came to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> seeking asylum, and another 12,000 immigrated for other reasons. It can take up to two years to process the application, and during that time the newcomer lives at the government's expense. People like <PERSON> Khadar </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Kercsik </LOCATION> brothers are able to relocate in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> because of a tradition of open doors. During World War II, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> accepted Jews and other refugees fleeing the Nazi onslaught. Later, Hungarians came after the 1956 invasion of their country, as did Czechs after 1968. Independence-seeking Kurds fleeing homes in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also came. Some belonged to the shadowy Kurdish People's Party which had been involved in terrorism. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> refused them asylum, but did not deport them to their native countries where they risked execution. Members of the Kurdish group have been suspects in the unsolved 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>, although no one has been prosecuted in the case. Until the 1970s <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> encouraged immigration to fill jobs. `` No one talked about terrorism until then,'' Ms. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Even when we did n't need the workers any more, the legislation never changed and the flow of refugees increased,'' she said. Now, despite the recent incidents, an overhaul of the system is unlikely. `` Everyone is very proud of our generous policy. I do n't think the politicians want to change it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Andersson </PERSON>.

 A crash that disrupted <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> service will cost the commuter rail system an estimated $ 2.6 million, a spokeswoman said Friday. The railroad should be back on a normal schedule Saturday. A train Thursday night rammed a tractor-trailer rig stuck at a crossing. Train service was canceled on one branch of the railroad. Eighteen people were injured, none seriously. The <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> expected to repair damaged tracks and remove the derailed cars by late Friday or early Saturday, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> said Friday's morning rush hour went as well as could be expected. `` There was n't much confusion,'' she said, adding that commuters used another branch of the <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> and buses. A witness to the crash said the driver of the tractor-trailer rig frantically tried to warn the train but then stood clear as the locomotive slammed into his flatbed trailer, which was carrying a bulldozer. The collision caused the engine to flip on its side, spilling diesel fuel. The engine and the second car ended up in a lumberyard adjacent to the tracks, Ms. <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> said. Three other cars derailed and two cars that were being stored on a siding were sideswiped and derailed, she added. <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said investigators would try to determine why the train did not stop in time. Among the questions, he said, is how fast it was going and `` whether or not indeed the truck driver did try to flag the train down.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> conceded today that a portion of his resume indicating he spent two years as the chief consumer investigator for the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Attorney General's office is `` inaccurate.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he did not know how the error occurred, but that his staff was responsible for putting together his resume. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> biography states that from 1970 to 1971, he was the `` chief investigator'' for the Consumer Protection Division of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Attorney General's office. But The -LRB- <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> -RRB- Plain Dealer reported today that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> actually held that position for only two and one-half months. `` If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I did n't hold that job for two years,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters aboard his campaign plane. He acknowledged that he held the job for `` several months'' but said he did not have `` an exact time frame.'' The paper said he was an entry-level research assistant for most of his time in the office. Earlier, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> called the newspaper report `` a cheap shot'' and said, `` He held the office. He worked his way up to that position and that's that.'' <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> said he was not sure how many months <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had held the consumer protection job, but added, `` The important point is that he held the job. He did n't make it up.'' The Plain Dealer said the consumer protection division did n't even exist in 1970, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had already gone to work in the governor's office when it was officially opened `` He just helped set it up,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lybrook </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Martinsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, lawyer who became the chief investigator when the division officially opened for business in September 1971. `` He was n't chief of anything when he went over there,'' added <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a former editor at the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> who arranged <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s job interview with then-Attorney General <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>. The Plain Dealer said state records show that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> went to work in the attorney general's office as a `` legal assistant'' in January 1970. It said the job is similar to that of a law clerk and involved drafting memoranda, performing research and writing letters. The newspaper said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held the investigator's job for 2 -LCB- months but that state records show he already was working for then-Gov. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON> as an administrative assistant when the consumer division was officially launched. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had completed campaigning for the day when the Plain Dealer story appeared and neither he nor his aides were immediately available to comment. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign moves west today to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s claim to have been chief investigator is contained in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> biography, which is being distributed as official background by the Republican campaign. The latest disclosures came just as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were seeing a week-long dispute about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record begin to dissipate. During his campaign appearances Thursday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> aimed his pitch at farmers in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. In stops at state fairs in both states, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met with farmers and told them: `` Do n't let anybody ever tell you that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not still dependent on agriculture and the farmers for our quality of life.''

He called this year's drought-relief package `` a good bill'' that he voted for, but did not respond to questions about why he opposed some drought relief measures in earlier years. `` I stand on my record,'' he said, when asked about the earlier votes. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s candidacy has been dogged by questions about whether he pulled strings to avoid the draft and enter the National Guard during the Vietnam War. He has denied using any `` undue influence.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s aides insisted that the draft controversy had faded.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s allergist reports there is `` no essential change'' in his condition after an annual checkup, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who gets a weekly shot to control his reaction to pollen, met Thursday with his long-time allergist, Dr. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookman </PERSON>. `` It was routine,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also was scheduled to be seen by Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> for an ear, nose and throat checkup. `` There are no problems that we are aware of at this point. It should be a routine check,'' the spokesman said. The examinations are conducted in the president's penthoue suite at the plush Century Plaza Hotel. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is spending a week of his August vacation here with his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. They are to return to their ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> on Saturday. The spokesman said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, holding to past practice, would not release the detailed results of the examinations. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent two days this week trying to rev up his conservative <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> followers for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Other than attending a series of private dinners with long-time friends, the president has been secluded in his penthouse tower. For her part, the first lady has been overseeing the refurbishment of the home in <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> that the couple plans to inhabit after leaving the White House. But so far, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> apparently has no plans to see the house during this visit to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The spokesman, asked why the president appeared to be disinterested in a home he'll live in, said, `` He probably is interested.'' `` I do n't know what his familiarity is with the house,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, adding that he knows the president is familiar with the neighborhood. The $ 2.5 million ranch-style home is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a group of about 20 unidentified <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> friends who bought it with the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> in mind, according to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> The three-year lease gives the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> the option to renew the lease or purchase the property. The extate includes 1.4 acres of grounds and a 35-year-old house with 7,192 sware feet of living space, as well as a pool. More than any other vacation trip, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has devoted time to helping boost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s quest for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as well as the campaign coffers of state Republican candidates. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for a $ 500-a-plate <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> fundraiser for Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., and one day later appeared with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a pep rally on Wednesday <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to attend two more fundraisers on Saturday on his way north to his 688-acre ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>.

 The new army chief told military officers he would try to ensure an orderly transition to civilian rule after the death of President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, official media reported Friday.

<TEXT>
 An earthquake that devastated parts of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> earlier this week has killed more than 980 people, officials from the two countries said Friday. Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town, calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to earthquake victims. `` Hang the murderers,'' scores of young men chanted as they marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of <PERSON> Karna </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON>, once a sympathizer of the now-outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Witnesses said <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON> was beaten with umbrellas and sticks late Thursday afternoon, then dragged through the streets for nearly two hours before police intervened. He died Friday at the Bir hospital in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, 7 miles west of <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Uttam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhaubanjar </PERSON>, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON> had been handing out blankets, milk and other food in <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION> when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters. Reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from remote parts of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> on Friday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> updated its confirmed death toll to 704. In <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the official count rose to 277. But survivors, the news media and opposition politicians say the toll could be as high as 1,500. Sunday's earthquake registered 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, which records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion measured by a seismograph. A reading of 6 indicates the possibility of severe damage, while 7 signifies a major quake. <PERSON> Dhaubanjar </PERSON> said he saw about 40 people rounded up by police Thursday night after <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON>'s beating death. He said many belonged to the same Communist faction that Hyanju once supported. `` People started beating him with umbrellas,'' <PERSON> Dhaubanjar </PERSON> said. `` There were a lot of scratches on his body, and a lot of blood. It looked like one ear was missing. Then they made a necklace of their shoes -LRB- by tying the laces together -RRB-, put it around his neck and pulled him through the streets.'' As <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON>'s body was taken through the winding streets of <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>, a 12th-century town of ancient Hindu temples, thousands of the town's 50,000 people jammed streets, temple steps and the balconies of brick and mud houses. <PERSON> Pashupati </PERSON> <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>, one of several Cabinet ministers who marched in the funeral procession, said several people were arrested in the killing, including the mayor, the deputy mayor and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Rashtriya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panchayat </ORGANIZATION>, or non-partisan assembly. <PERSON> Rana </PERSON>, who is minister of local development and legislative, affairs, called <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON>'s death `` political murder.'' <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON> served in the Panchayat from 1981 until 1986 when he lost the backing of the Communists in <LOCATION> Bhaktapur </LOCATION>, traditionally a leftist stronghold. The Panchayat, whose members are elected on non-party lines, was created after the late king <PERSON> Mahendra </PERSON> abolished the old <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and all political parties in 1960, saying a Western-style parliamentary system was not suited to his mountain kingdom. <PERSON> Dhaubanjar </PERSON> and a group of young men who gathered around him said <PERSON> Hyanju </PERSON> was perceived as a government supporter despite his previous communist leanings.

 Dense bands of locust larvae will `` explode'' into massive swarms in the next two weeks in central and east <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and the insects will inflict severe damage on crops, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency said Friday. `` The extent of infestation in certain African countries is enormous, and we are extremely concerned,'' said <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no doubt that there will be heavy damage to crops in the middle of the agricultural season.'' <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brader </PERSON>, head of the agency's emergency center for locust operations, said that 14 million to 17 million acres of land in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> are infested with dense bands of locust larvae. `` They are going to explode in the next two weeks and form massive swarms which will affect large areas of agricultural lands,'' he said, adding that the size of each swarm could cover hundreds of square miles. `` The plague has reached unprecedented proportions and can not be controlled in the near future,'' <PERSON> Brader </PERSON> said. Heavy rains, particulary in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, have created favorable breeding conditions for the locusts.

 <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> is blind, but he sails for the same reasons sighted people do: fresh air, warm sunshine and the feel of the wind at his back. `` You do n't need eyes to sail,'' he says, `` as long as you can feel the wind and know where it's going to take you.'' <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>'s not just optimistic. Sighted volunteers who accompany blind sailors in a program held at marinas in the <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> sections of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> corroborate his claims. `` I've learned more from them, I have n't taught them a thing,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, 68, a former champion sailor whose Courageous Sailing Center sponsors the 10-year-old program with the <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for the Blind in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>. It is believed to be the only organized sailing program for the blind in the country. <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> was inspired to help teach the blind to sail as a result of his own experiences learning to sail. At age 4, he said, his father taught him to sail blindfolded so he would learn to better sense the wind and gain balance. `` It's more about feel and balance than sight,'' <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> said on a recent Saturday while he motored around <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> checking on the blind sailors. `` I always said that someday I'd teach the blind to sail _ and it works.'' `` When you sail, you sail in relation to the wind,'' said volunteer guide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trickett </PERSON>, 29. `` All the key factors about sailing have nothing to do with sight.'' Visually impaired people from all over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> participate in the sailing program. The cost is $ 1 per season. Most have never been on a small boat when they step gingerly onto the vessels. `` When I first went out I was a little scared the whole boat was going to tip over with me in it,'' said <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Busch </PERSON>. `` But now I do n't have that feeling anymore. I just enjoy it.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, 41, a rehabilitation counselor blind since age 5, and <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 41, who is legally blind, travel by bus from <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, every weekend to sail. `` We may not beat anyone else out here but we have fun,'' said <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>. `` Our friends think we're a little crazy but then they know that we'll try anything. We go cross-country skiing, we went to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. We like being outdoors.'' <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> said she was a little fearful at first. `` All they say out here is ` Rose!' _ to let me know I should do something,'' said <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>. `` I kind of fill in the blanks and figure out what should be done.'' Volunteers sail in boats with the blind sailors, teaching novices how to trim the sails, how to tack and reminding them not to try to sail against the wind. For those with some experience, the guides are there merely to tell the blind sailors if other boats are coming or if they are too near shore. `` To be a good sailor you need to be in harmony with the wind and the waves and the boat,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, who directs the program for the <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroder </PERSON>, 27, a volunteer guide, said she was doubtful the blind could sail when she heard about the program. But she was soon convinced. `` It does n't matter whether you're blind or not,'' she said. `` You just need a good instructor.'' The blind sailors sail every Saturday either at the Courageous Sailing Center at the <ORGANIZATION> Charlestown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> or in the protected waters of Pleasure Bay off <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. At the end of the summer, they participate in a special regatta. The rules are simple: One sighted volunteer accompanies each blind sailor in a boat but the volunteer is not allowed to touch anything during the race. He or she is allowed only to warn of hazards. `` This is n't going to make them to be Olympic sailors,'' said <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>. `` We're just teaching them something to love that they otherwise would never get a chance to do.''

 More than 200 workers at a city construction project were forced to kneel before drug-sniffing dogs or lose their jobs, an experience one angry union official likened to slavery. Municipal officials and representatives of the project's construction manager said Thursday that the Aug. 18 search at the city's $ 81 million <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meyerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> turned up nothing `` When they make you get down in front of an animal on your knees, that's getting back into slavery,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, business manager of Ironworkers Local 481. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lady </PERSON>, senior vice president for J.W. <ORGANIZATION> Bateson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the company that is serving as construction manager, said he and other managers knew about the search and submitted to it. Workers and managers were invidually taken to a room and asked to squat on one knee while a dog sniffed them. The search, which involved more than 200 workers, was undertaken after a former employee reported that drugs were allegedly being used at the construction site. `` The construction industry has a certain amount of risk and danger to it, and that has to be controlled,'' <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Keheley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> director, said he authorized the search the day before it was conducted without consulting any other city officials. `` They wanted our concurrence and we, of course, gave it immediately,'' <PERSON> Keheley </PERSON> said. `` I would have seen a bigger problem of not doing it. If there's any suspicion at all of illegal activity on that site, we do n't want it.'' Several workers said they would gladly have submitted to blood tests or other samples if there had been probable cause to suspect drug use. `` This is the only major construction job going on -LRB- in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> -RRB- right now _ and if you did n't submit to that search, you got kicked off your job,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcox </PERSON>, a 28-year-old flagman, said. `` It is degrading to have to get down on your knees to keep your job.''

 The owner of an illegal basement nightclub where six people died in a fire was arrested at a pay phone after police traced a call he made to a detective to assert his innocence, authorities said Friday. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, 37, was charged Thursday with six counts of manslaughter and 10 of reckless endangerment in the blaze at the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> club known as The Hole, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. The Fire Department said the blaze Sunday appeared to be accidental, but <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> was held responsible because the club was illegally operated, authorities said. The club served liquor without a license and did not have enough exits, officials said. Six patrons were killed and 33 others injured. The reckless endangerment counts relate to the 10 most seriously injured, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> was arrested after he called police, ran out of change and gave the number to a detective who promised to call back, said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. The detective kept him on the line for 35 minutes while police used the number to locate the phone. `` <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> was explaining -LRB- to the detective -RRB- he did n't think he'd done anything wrong,'' said <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> `` Basically, he was protesting his innocence.'' Police are also looking for <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>' partner in the club, but <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he is believed to be out of the country. Police had raided The Hole five times since March and made nine arrests, said mayoral spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. The steep, narrow staircase leading down to the club was `` no better than a ladder,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulligan </PERSON>. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who said Monday he wanted the city to do more to close illegal social clubs, described the club, a 50-by-75-foot T-shaped space, as a `` rabbit warren.''

 A prosecutor, saying there are more dangerous people to prosecute than a combative talk show host, has decided not to arrest <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on a complaint that he scuffled with a weekly newspaper editor during a stage show here.

I'm very glad he said in his statement that <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> broke the law.'' But, he added, `` I think it's unfortunate that some guy who's a celebrity can get away with backing himself up with thousands of groupies and he can get away with attacking someone. If it was a poor black kid with three friends cheering him on, I think he would get arrested.''

<HEAD>Soldiers Trade Gunfire in Panama; Army To Cut Tour Length</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A squad of Army Special Operations soldiers on a routine patrol at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, traded gunfire with a small group of intruders but no one was hurt, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Friday. The Thursday night incident came as the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was poised to cut the required tour length in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, part of a continuing effort to reduce the number of military dependents in the troubled Central American nation. The service hopes to encourage more soldiers to opt for so-called `` unaccompanied tours'' _ leaving their families behind _ by reducing the tour commitment, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> officials, who asked not to be named. The exchange of gunfire, which occurred Thursday evening near an oil tank farm, was the first such incident in nearly three weeks. The officials said American soldiers spotted two or three intruders before nightfall Thursday, drawing fire from the unidentified men but not returning it. Later, around 9 p.m., the soldiers were patrolling the tank farm area and again spotted intruders, who again fired. This time they returned the gunfire. The intruders immediately `` broke contact'' and slipped into the jungle, the sources said. The pending tour reduction plan, stemming in part from a campaign of harrassment against Americans, would allow <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to move more military families from civilian housing in and around <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to military housing on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. According to the sources, the plan is awaiting final approval from Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuono </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of staff, and Army Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>. That should come early next week, the officials said Friday. Once the Army acts, the other three military services are almost certain to follow suit, predicted one official. Currently, soldiers deployed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are expected to serve for three years if accompanied by their family and two years if unaccompanied. The new plan would reduce an accompanied tour to 2 -LCB- years and slash the minimum unaccompanied tour to just 15 months. `` Given all the turmoil, we're hoping more soldiers will decide they can go unaccompanied and stick it out for 15 months,'' said one official. Over the past five months, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has succeeded in reducing by 50 percent the number of military families living outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ dropping the total still off-base to about 1,130. The effort has taken on more momentum this summer because of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> describes as a deliberate campaign of harrassing Americans. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said Aug. 21 that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by Panamanian authorities this year, including attempts to extort bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail. The harassment comes at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is continuing to press economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a bid to oust the country's leader, military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is the home of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, the organization responsible for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There are about 10,000 American servicemen stationed permanently in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, plus about 2,200 servicemen who have been assigned there on a temporary basis since the spring to upgrade security at American bases. Sources said the move to reduce tour lengths for soldiers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> comes amid rumors that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government intends to cancel the leases on 100 off-base housing units rented by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> itself for military families.

 Air traffic controllers canceled planned strikes after the government pledged to improve airport equipment, union leaders said Friday. The decision came a week after controllers in <LOCATION> Catalonia </LOCATION> agreed to cancel three days of strikes in return for government promises to raise pay for all 940 controllers in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and eliminate regional salary differences. The strikes would have affected <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s busiest holiday routes and collapsed its Mediterranean airports, already overburdened by summer travelers. The Tenerife controllers called off the strike after <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mederos </PERSON> pledged to install a new radar system at <LOCATION> Reina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> airport and improve the control tower at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rodeos </LOCATION> airport, the leaders said.

 Police officials said Friday they were investigating a fight that broke out between police officers and followers of black <PERSON> Muslim </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> who were trying to drive prostitutes from the capital's red-light district. The trouble began about 11:30 p.m. Thursday, when officers noticed about 25 members of the Nation of Islam shouting insults at streetwalkers and trying to disrupt their contact with passing motorists, said police spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>. Officers patrolling the intersection just five blocks from the White House repeatedly warned the Muslims not to jaywalk or step in front of moving vehicles, <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said. When one officer attempted to issue a jaywalking citation to one of the Muslims, several of the man's friends began to push the officer, who called for help from colleagues, the spokesman said. When order was restored 20 minutes later, three police officers and four Muslims had been hurt, none seriously, and eight of <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s followers had been arrested. Seven were charged with disorderly conduct and one with assaulting a police officer, <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said. He said officials were investigating the incident. Earlier this year, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION> beat a television reporter and cameraman after they refused to turn over videotapes that reportedly showed several Muslims assaulting a suspected drug dealer. No charges were filed. Police later acknowledged that patrols by <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s followers helped reduce narcotics trafficking at an apartment complex that was one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s most notorious drug marketplaces.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Friday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must end what he called its `` hostile policy'' against his country before <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> will resume cooperation on humanitarian issues. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said he sent a letter Aug. 10 to retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, a special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential envoy, reaffirming <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s opposition to congressional testimony July 28 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> had called for continued isolation of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> until it ends its decade-old occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Thach spoke with reporters after talks with Thai Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> on the last day of a five-day visit. He later flew home. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> gave no details of his letter to <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, but said, `` The cause -LRB- of suspension of cooperation -RRB- is there so to resume -LRB- cooperation -RRB-, you must liquidate the cause.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said Aug. 3 it was temporarily halting participation in efforts to account for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen missing in the war and in resettling former political prisoners in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, despite recent agreements on those issues. It cited <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON>'s testimony as the reason for its decision. In his testimony <PERSON> Sigur </PERSON> argued against a congressional resolution urging the establishment of `` interest sections'' _ diplomatic missions below the level of embassies _ in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, saying the move would not improve cooperation on humanitarian issues. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> agreed a year ago that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would accelerate its accounting of nearly 1,800 Americans missing in action, and in return the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would help <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with its humanitarian problems. <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> told <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> in July that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would try to resolve 70 top priority MIA cases by year's end, and welcomed joint excavations for remains between August and October.

<HEAD>Trial Posponed for Brother of Oakland Pitcher</HEAD>

 A kidnapping and attempted murder trial was postponed after the defendant's lawyer said it would hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> pennant chances and harm the career of his client's brother, star pitcher <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON>. A new trial date has been set Dec. 12 for <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, 35, who is charged with the 1987 choking, beating and stabbing of a 59-year-old woman and leaving her for dead. The trial was set Aug. 22, but a motion to postpone was filed Aug. 4. District Court Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> granted the motion after a hearing and set the new trial date. The motion said a defense investigator recently visited <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` following leads and witnesses in order to support the defense of intoxication'' and had uncovered more potential witnesses. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, contended the motion for postponement rested largely on the need for more time to prepare a defense. But the two-page motion also dealt with <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON>, 33, and the effect the trial might have on his career if he were called in midseason to testify. The document said <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON> will be a `` critical'' defense witness. `` <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON>'s ball club is in first place in their major league division and will go to the playoffs in all likelihood,'' the court document said. `` The management of the club is absolutely opposed to his appearance as a witness until after the baseball season. `` The calling of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON> would cause tremendous adverse publicity for his ball club and for himself and could have a substantial effect on his major league career and this season in particular. It would be grossly unfair to potentially ruin another life or career in this situation,'' the document said. `` I think it's very interesting about this baseball,'' said the victim, <PERSON> Sigrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Griswold </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. `` When I read the motion and found three paragraphs devoted to the baseball issue, I was shocked.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Immel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> pleaded guilty to kidnapping in the case and was sentenced in November to 48 years in prison. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON> also pleaded guilty but changed his mind after <PERSON> Immel </PERSON>'s sentencing and asked for a trial Reached by telephone in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Athletics General Manager <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> said Thursday he was not aware of a motion to postpone and had not been contacted about the possibility of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckersley </PERSON> testifying. `` We were vaguely aware of something involving his brother,'' <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> said. `` But we were not specifically aware of a trial pending.'' But <PERSON> Alderson </PERSON> added that `` clearly something of this sort would be a distraction to <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> during the course of the season.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Smoldering fires and the risk of collapsing buildings Friday prevented investigators from finding the cause of a blaze that destroyed much of the historic Chiado shopping district. Civil engineers and other experts were told their inquiry would have to wait until the fire completely subsided in the cellars of the 150 - and 200-year-old buildings that were used to store highly combustible materials such as textiles and paper Firefighters also said the burned-out shells of the <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Grandela and the <ORGANIZATION> Grandes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Chiado department stores were probably beyond propping up and could collapse at any minute. The fire broke out in the <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Grandela early Thursday and in the next four hours swept through buildings on the narrow streets of the neighborhood known for its speciality shops and cafes where artists and writers gathered. One man died and 43 people, six of whom remained hospitalized Friday, were injured. Fire officials say they do n't know what caused the blaze, the worst in the capital in 200 years. News reports raised the possibility of arson. Union representatives said about 2,000 people, mostly clerical and shop workers, lost their jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Lisbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Matos </PERSON> put damages at $ 600 million, nearly double the estimate of insurance adjustors. He told a news conference that stores in the entire downtown area would suffer from the effects of the fire despite official promises to rebuild the Chiado. `` We fear that people will change their shopping habits,'' he said. `` Remember that it took 14 years to restore the National Theater after it burned.'' <PERSON> Matos </PERSON> said 40 stores were destroyed, not counting the offices of many lawyers and accountants on upper floors. <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Nuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abecasis </PERSON>, who met Thursday night with architects, urban planners and cultural officials, told reporters it would be a year before reconstruction of the area could begin. <PERSON> Matos </PERSON> called the old, battered state of the equipment used by firefighters `` shameful.'' The daily <PERSON> Correiro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Manha </PERSON> said reporters sent to the central fire station discovered that none of the buildings destroyed in the Chiado was connected to the department's centralized alert system. Neither of the two department stores had sprinkler systems installed, and no recent fire inspections had been carried out in the area's shops, the paper said. The weekly <PERSON> Sabado </PERSON> said the most serious outcome of the fire was that <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> citizens, `` who have long lived with the impression that their city is under permanent threat ... are now aware how little is done to avoid such disasters.'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Monteiro </PERSON>, owner of three stores destroyed in the Chiado fire, urged <PERSON> Matos </PERSON> to demand an impartial inquiry into why the mayor had ignored shopowners' protests and built stone planters and tables in the middle of the <LOCATION> Rua </LOCATION> do Carmo that prevented fire-fighting equipment from reaching the <ORGANIZATION> Armazens </ORGANIZATION> do Grandela store. The Chiado district is in a part of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> that was rebuilt following a disastrous 1755 earthquake and fire that destroyed much of the medieval part of the city.

 Young workers this summer are experiencing the lowest unemployment rate since 1969 with a record 68.5 percent of the nation's youths holding jobs, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The unemployment rate among workers aged 16-24 was 10.9 percent in July compared with 11.7 percent a year ago, the department said. But all of the improvement was among whites; blacks did not share in any of it, the government said. Only about half of the nation's black youths have jobs this summer, compared with three-fourths of white youths. `` Black youths continued to be about twice as likely as whites to work in government jobs,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. `` Their proportion in these jobs, however _ 12.6 percent this summer _ has dropped 4 full percentage points from the high reached two summers ago.'' The jobless rate for white youths in July was 8.9 percent, compared with 9.7 percent a year earlier. The rate among black youths was almost three times higher _ 25.3 percent, the same as in July 1987. The proportion of youths either working or looking for work climbed to an all-time high of 78.6 percent in July, 0.6 percentage point above what it was a year ago. But because of the continuing decline in the size of the youth population, the actual number of young workers in the labor force has fallen by 270,000 in the past year to 25.3 million, the department said. Labor force participation among white youths has reached a record 79.4 percent this summer after hovering around 78.6 percent the past four years. `` In marked contrast,'' the government said, `` labor force participation for black youths, which had dropped more than 2 percentage points between 1986 and 1987, held steady at 65.7 percent in July.''

 The government on Friday described a rare strike this week by 300 miners as `` regrettable'' but understandable in view of economic hardships under an austerity program.

State-run newspapers said the cabinet met Thursday and decided to change regulations regarding sick leave pay to eliminate contradictions the miners had asked be done away with. <PERSON> Judit </PERSON> <PERSON> Csehak </PERSON>, minister of social-welfare and health, said the new regulations which would reduce sick pay received since Jan. 1 by about 10 percent would go into effect Oct. 1. The miners at the <PERSON> Komlo </PERSON> mine in southern <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had complained that because of a quirk in tax laws introduced at the beginning of this year, workers on sick leave could earn more than those working regularly. Government spokesman <PERSON> Gyorgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marosan </PERSON> said the government considered the 20-hour strike `` regrettable and avoidable'' but understandable `` under the circumstances,'' newspapers reported. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported that the government would ask parliament to consider amendments to the tax bills before the end of this year, but gave no details. In a letter to the government, the miners warned that the tax `` does not stimulate increased production or the undertaking of extra shifts.''

He said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` has no selfish interests'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and would not approve a return to power by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, who killed hundreds of thousands of people during its 1975-78 rule.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said Friday he will lead the way as faculty and administrators voluntarily submit to the drug screening required this year of <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s 6,000 students. `` All of us have agreed to voluntary drug testing at random and several of us at the top, myself included, will be drug tested,'' said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, the school's founder and chancellor. He said he knows of no other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> college or university that tests all students for drugs. `` I'm hopeful they will watch what we're doing and follow suit,'' he said. Liberty students were notified by mail over the summer and each has signed a waiver agreeing to submit to urine screening. `` We have checked with thousands of young people and have n't received a complaint,'' said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, a television evangelist and founder of the Moral Majority conservative lobbying organization Urine-testing could begin next week and will include all students during the program's first year, said Dr. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Albers </PERSON>, the school's director of health services. There are no plans to test employees of <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s other organizations. Tests will be given to about 200 students a week in a special bathroom designed to make it difficult for anyone to alter the urine sample. The urine will be screened three times with the last test breaking it down to the molecular level. Testing will be done for illegal and abusable prescription drugs and will be used to spot other health problems, <PERSON> Albers </PERSON> said. Students who test positive will be offered counseling, and possibly a second chance. `` While the school takes a very strong position against drugs, we're not going to be unreasonable in our methds,'' said <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoss </PERSON>.

 Panamanian military leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has fired the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> consul in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, whose office had been used by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoys for obtaining visas for travel to that country, a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> diplomat said Friday. The <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government has been rejecting visas approved by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s consulate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because it is staffed by officials loyal to ousted President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. As an alternative, American diplomats had been obtaining travel documents from the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> consul, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who had maintained ties with both the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> loyalists. But a Panamanian diplomat in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a supporter of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was fired this week by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. A receptionist at the Tampa consulate, reached by telephone, said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was ill on Friday. She said she was unaware of the report that Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had been removed from her post. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official could not confirm that Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had been fired but said the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government was no longer accepting visas signed by the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> consulate. The official and the Panamanian diplomat insisted on anonymity. Another department official said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats have alternatives other than the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> consulate for obtaining visas but he refused to elaborate. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has declined to recognize the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government and regards <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate authority in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> even though he was ousted six months ago and has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ever since. It also recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, as the official Panamanian representative in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has ignored attempts by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to replace him, told a news conference Thursday that the embassy officially recognizes the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> consulate, implying that Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> had broken with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in its editions of last Sunday that the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> consulate recently had approved visas for 14 American officials who were either serving in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on expired visas or recently assigned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The administration has barred its diplomats from having official dealings with representatives of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> government. As a result, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats have been prevented from obtaining visas from consuls loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

 A prison inmate who tested positive for the AIDS virus and allegedly spit on a correctional officer has been indicted on a charge of attempted murder. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, 27, who was serving a robbery sentence, told several prison guards at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that he had AIDS and threatened to infect them, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, a special prosecutor. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> are not related. `` He carried it out by spitting on the officer,'' the prosecutor said. `` This guy has a disease and he's using it aggressively against other people.'' Grand jurors who handed up the indictment Tuesday saw a video recording of the prisoner's actions. Doctors said <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> tested positive for HIV, which causes the fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There is no known cure for the disease. Chances of AIDS transmission by saliva are extremely low, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>. `` But the crux of the matter is his intent, even though he may not be able to carry it out by that means,'' he said. The guard has experienced a `` great deal of trauma'' and must have periodic blood tests to check for the presence of the virus, said the prosecutor. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON> faces a possible sentence of 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of attempted murder.

<TEXT>
 A spokesman for Kurdish rebels said Friday that 88 civilians were killed and 500 people injured when <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes dropped poison gas bombs on five Kurdish villages in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> a day before. Western diplomats in the Iraqi capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> confirmed that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has launched a major assault on the Kurdish guerrillas now that it has been freed from fighting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> by a week-old cease-fire. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million Kurds have been fighting for an independent homeland for more than 50 years. The guerrillas formed an alliance with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> two years ago, opening a second war front that pinned down tens of thousands of Iraqi troops badly needed in the main battlefields to the south. Thursday's reported attacks on the Kurds came as Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leaders met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for talks to end the nearly 8-year-old war. Kurdish and Iranian officials have said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used an Aug. 20 cease-fire to intensify its campaign against the guerrillas, while <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is using the truce to regroup shattered forces. Six fighter-bombers carried out the attack on five villages in the <LOCATION> Zakho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Amadiyah </LOCATION> regions of northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> near the Turkish border, said the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said 88 people died and 500 were injured. The rebel spokesman called The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> bureau in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> from a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> capital, which he refused to be identified for `` security reasons.'' The use of chemical weapons is outlawed under a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. `` We appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to offer their humanitarian assistance to the gas victims through the Turkish <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>,'' that country's equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said the spokesman.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday accused <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of lax crime policies, turning the tables on the Democrat's criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration drug efforts a day before. During a campaign trip in his adopted home state, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also took up the defense of his embattled running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, telling a rally that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be `` an outstanding vice president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the rally in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that it was `` an insult'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to refer to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s drug policies as `` criminal'' and `` absurd'' when thousands of federal and local law enforcement officials `` are putting their lives on the line every single day to stop the narcotics flow.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` is the governor who vetoed the mandatory sentencing for drug dealers. He opposes capital punishment for drug king pins. And he fought tooth and nail to keep that outrageous furlough program that lets murderers, rapists and drug dealers out on appeal.'' As to his own plans to combat drugs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who headed a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> task force on drugs, said `` one way we must do it is support our local law enforcement officers who are out there every day.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also repeated his support for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who he has not mentioned by name in two previous days of campaigning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> touted the congressional qualifications that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign had hoped to emphasize before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> became embroiled in questions about using his family influence to join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> rather than be drafted during the Vietnam War. `` Here's a man elected twice to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, twice to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a wonderfully thoughtful person who has taken a leadership role in job retraining ... but also is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, knows as I do that only a strong <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can prevent expansion of totalitarianism around the world,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a hall filled with about 2,500 supporters. `` He'll be an outstanding vice president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> from his plane Friday morning, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. The vice president told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` I think things are going very well.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last spoke to his 41-year-old running mate two days earlier, said press secretary <PERSON> Shiela </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, who said the two `` keep in touch.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said the campaign believes the firestorm over <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has peaked. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> himself now refuses to answer further questions about his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is pushing hard to tout his credentials as a Texan, a state where he moved 40 years ago to go into the oil business and later served as a member of the House. `` This is a key state and I'm not going to let them take it away from me,'' he told the <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> rally. `` It's my state ... I understand this state.'' At the end of his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> briefly donned a white 10-gallon hat. He put it on again at the airport before leaving <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION> and when he stepped off Air Force Two in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He told the Texans he would do more for them than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, highlighting their differences on energy, defense and gun control. `` My opponent opposes offshore drilling, and I support it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He also called for a tax credit for oil exploration to increase the industry drilling rig count, adding `` and I do know what a rig count is.'' He reiterated his support for the Strategic Defense Initiative which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes. `` He says it is fantasy. I say it is essential. I will support research vigorously and fully and when it is ready I will deploy it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A judge Friday ordered the seizure of jewelry and other luxury items that <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> allegedly bought with some of the $ 690,000 donated by strangers last year for her dying son's liver transplants Dade Probate Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> granted a request from lawyers for a court-appointed curator of the estate of <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>, who died in April 1987 at age 7. The order also struck Ms. DeSillers' $ 150,000 claim on the estate. `` I'm going to ruin you, lady,'' a furious Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said as the curator, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, left the judge's chamber Friday. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> ignored the comments and declined to say anything about them later. `` You call this justice? She'll never run for public office in this state,'' Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> said loudly as her attorneys sought to quiet her. In a separate ruling Thursday, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> dismissed Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>' request to hold Ms. DeSillers in contempt for not handing over records of her purchases and the disputed items themselves, which include a diamond-sapphire ring and diamond-studded gold cross Being forced under threat of jail to turn over the records and purchases could violate Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' right against self-incrimination, because criminal investigations are under way in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> counties, the judge had ruled Thursday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dribin </PERSON>, an attorney for Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, said having a third party seize the items did not expose Ms. DeSillers to self-incrimination. Friday's order does not cover the records, only the disputed items. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> has estimated that the amount of donations that Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> may have improperly spent on herself, family and friends was $ 200,000. The seizure order does not list any dollar value for the items. Besides the ring and the cross, it includes such things as an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computer, a diamond-studded gold bracelet, about $ 4,000 in furniture, a car phone and a gold watch. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> declined to say when the seizure might take place. The national spotlight turned on Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> in early 1987 after the theft of $ 4,000 raised by <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s classmates for a needed transplant. Donations poured in, including $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and $ 200,000 from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> died after three failed liver transplants at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. His mother has refused to pay the $ 262,000 balance of his medical bill, claiming the boy received inadequate care, a charge the hospital denies vehemently. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, an attorney, was appointed curator of the child's estate in March, after Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' handling of the donations came under fire when it was learned she rented an apartment in a posh, waterfront apartment building and had purchased a used BMW for $ 13,500 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, one of Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' lawyers, 33, says some of his client's purchases may not be improper as claimed because some of the donations were given for her personal use. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said his client has been unfairly portrayed as `` greedy and grasping'' when she gave thousands of dollars to poor families with sick children.

In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> rejected the report's contention. `` We are not doing that,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` The Banking Committee is wrong. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is independent. We are not applying pressure of any kind.'' Four Republican members of the panel also issued a statement saying the report `` loses objectivity and perspective'' in portraying the remarks of <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> `` as an effort to exert improper pressure.'' The statement was signed by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, R-Neb.; Kit Bond, R-Mo., and <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION> The Republicans also scoffed at the report's contention that <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> attempted to influence the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> through the press, saying his views were not supposed to be kept secret and noting that the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> itself had called him as a witness in open hearings. The report said <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> `` has made repeated attempts to influence <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy through the press and through criticisms published in the Economic Report of the President for 1988.'' It said <PERSON> Darby </PERSON> `` wrote a letter to the governors of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and to the <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> presidents on the Federal Open Market Committee just before the February meeting suggesting that money growth was too slow.'' The report said the remarks could be `` ironically counterproductive'' because they `` could result in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> acting less vigorously than it otherwise would in the recommended direction, or acting in a direction contrary to the suggesting of the administration, in an effort to preserve the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation for independence. `` The problems of political independence are particularly acute at the present time when all members of the board of governors were appointed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' said the report. The report described as `` somewhat diversionary'' attempts `` by some within the administration'' to blame the crash on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s slow-growth policy preceding October 1987 It said slow growth was a result of an agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the administration made necessary by the 1987 Louvre Accord between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and six other major industrial nations. The accord was aimed at stabilizing the dollar after a two-year lowering. `` The administration is therefore jointly responsible for the slow rate of money growth and any of the resulting consequences,'' the report said. `` Attempts to single out the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> as the scapegoat for the stock market crash or any of the consequences of the slower than normal growth in the money supply are therefore incredible.''

<HEAD>Navy To Begin Random Drug Testing Of Civilian Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it would begin random drug testing of selected civilian employees this fall. The service said its final plan for the tests had been signed Aug. 6 by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> and that 81,000 of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 337,000 civilian workers are being notified they will be subject to urinalysis testing for drugs Although testing legally could begin as early as Oct. 6, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> does not plan to start the program until early November, said Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> becomes the second military service to launch a testing program for civilian workers; the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> already is testing civilian workers in sensitive positions. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> still is working on its testing guidelines. All of the military services have long tested men and women on active duty. Three months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> forwarded to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the drug testing plans of 24 different government agencies, technically clearing the way for the agencies to begin testing when they were ready. The plans were developed as part of a broad administration campaign to ensure a drug-free workplace. In forwarding the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had tagged about 200,000 civilian positions as sensitive enough to warrant testing, but did not provide a breakdown among the various services. The department employs about 1 million civilian workers. According to <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, most of the 81,000 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> positions designated as subject to testing are in the areas of `` public health and safety, protection of life and property, law enforcement and national security.'' Civilian workers who receive a notice that their job has been designated `` sensitive'' and who then immediately request assistance for drug use will be offered counseling and rehabilitation without penalty, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. Those who do not voluntarily come forward in the very beginning and who subsequently test positive for drugs will be subject to administrative and punitive sanctions up to and including dismissal, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to test about 20,000 civilians during the first year of its program. Unlike military personnel, the civilian workers will be allowed to provide urine samples without being directly observed, the spokesman said. The drugs to be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines and phencyclidine.

<HEAD>Bush, Quayle Paint Dukakis as Weak on Crime</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Republican ticketmate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> depicted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on crime on Friday, and the vice president said his Democratic rival's criticism of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration anti-drug efforts were `` an insult.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent the day working in his governor's office in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and offered no immediate rebuttal to he latest <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign blasts. Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> called for more spending on rural health care programs as he toured <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> behaved more and more like a man who felt the controversy surrounding his running mate's service in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was fading. The vice president talked with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> by telephone for the first time in two days and reporters were told that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advised his running mate that `` things are going very well.'' But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also conceded an error in his official biography _ after his press spokesman first denounced a newspaper story about the matter as a `` cheap shot.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said it was `` inaccurate'' to say that he had spent two years working as chief consumer investigator for the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> attorney general's office, but blamed the error on his staff. `` If it indicated that, that is inaccurate,'' he said of his official biography. `` I did n't hold the job for two years.'' The issue arose after The Plain Dealer of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> reported that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> actually held the position for a little over two months. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was hired as an entry-level employee in the attorney general's office in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> in 1970, several months before the consumer division was created. He later held the investigator position. But after more than a week of fending off controversy about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his service in the National Guard, the Republicans went on the offensive. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he spent his second straight day trying to firm up support in his _ and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s _ home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` He is the governor who vetoed the mandatory sentencing for drug dealers. He opposes capital punishment for drug kingpins. And he fought tooth and nail to keep that outrageous furlough program that lets murderers, rapists and drug dealers out on appeal,'' the vice president said of his Democratic opponent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also fired back at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' sharp attack Thursday on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's war on drugs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said parts of it were `` criminal'' and added the enterprise was a failure. `` That is an insult,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, adding that his Democratic rival should have noted that many federal and local law enforcement personnel have lost their lives trying to stop the illegal flow of narcotics. His press aide, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, denied the vice president was shifting his position on Star Wars. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said three weeks ago he favors deployment of the missile defense system `` as soon as feasible.'' In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that full deployment would be `` very expensive'' and said any decision would have to await further research. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, campaigning in Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for supporting gun control during his tenure as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` Americans would be much better off if our opponent believed in crime control rather than gun control,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tended to state business, but paused to answer a question after swearing in a new transportation official. Asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement on Star Wars, the governor said, `` I think he's taking the right position and I'm pleased that he has.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has long been a firm opponent of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's space-based missile defense proposal, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a supporter. Aides said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would soon scale back the amount of time he devotes to statehouse duties and increase his campaigning around the country from three days a week to five or six. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, on a swing through the South, went with 87-year-old Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stennis </PERSON> to a hospital ward where premature infants are cared for. He later said he will continue to seek increased spending for rural health care programs, including those dealing with newborns. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was unable to make a scheduled appearance in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> later in the day when his chartered jet was grounded. The front door of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 was damaged when federal agents guarding the plane forced it closed. They broke a hinge mechanism which props the door open when it's on the ground, and that in turn punctured the door. The damage meant the door might not stay open in case of an emergency evacuation, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered repairs, said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>. The incident came on the heels of several mishaps with planes chartered for reporters covering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. But it marked the first time a candidate had to alter his travel plans because of problems with his aircraft. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, one-time <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pledged to get out the vote for the Democratic ticket. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> represent an alternative, a chance to change,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. In the colorful rhetoric that marked his campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> want to privatize the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. They want to privatize foreign policy. They want to privatize public education. And since they like privacy so much, I want to help them move back into private life.''

<HEAD>Bomb Found on Policeman's Car and Defused</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A policeman spotted a bomb attached to his car Friday and British army explosives experts defused it, authorities reported. No group claimed responsibility for the bomb, but suspicion fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The officer, who was not identified, found the bomb while his car was parked at his home in <LOCATION> Sion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Strabane </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>, 115 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. Later Friday, a court in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> refused to block extradition of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, where he will resume a 20-year prison sentence imposed in 1978 for the attempted murder of a policeman. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 30, is suspected of membership in the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which is outlawed on both sides of the border. He escaped from the Maze Prison in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> during a mass breakout in 1983 and has fought extradition since. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, held a vigil at <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Mountjoy </PERSON> jail Friday to protest the decision. Police said the car bomb defused in <LOCATION> Sion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> contained three pounds of the lightweight explosive called Semtex, which is made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and has been used by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in its current wave of attacks on soldiers and other security personnel. About 150 families were evacuated from nearby homes while the bomb squad conducted carefully controlled explosions over five hours to make the device harmless, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has promised to stop Semtex from reaching the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. Security forces have said in the past the explosive was included in arms shipments from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. A car bomb using Semtex killed a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruiting officer Monday as he drove home from his office in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. On the British mainland, funerals were held for six of eight soldiers killed Aug. 19 in the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombing of a bus near <LOCATION> Omagh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>. `` The hope for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is her ordinary people, who will never be daunted by the men and women of violence,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> told 400 mourners at the funeral of Pvt. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, 19, in <LOCATION> Lyngford </LOCATION>, 120 miles west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. About 10 miles farther west, leather-jacketed motorcyclists accompanied the hearse of Pvt. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>, 21, a fellow member of the <ORGANIZATION> Somerset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sickle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bikers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, to the cemetery at Stoke sub <PERSON> Hamdon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Somerset </LOCATION>. The bikers sent a wreath in the shape of a motorcycle wheel. It joined another wreath, one of six sent to the funerals bearing the message, `` From the people of <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>.'' Twenty-seven military personnel have been killed this summer by <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The bus attack was the deadliest since 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the republic, which is overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, who is making a left-wing challenge to <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> for the party leadership, said in <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should leave in January 1990. `` If a peacekeeping force is needed to cover the transition, it should be a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> force,'' he said. `` The argument that British troops must remain to stop bloodshed is completely invalid, for these troops are a central part of the problem.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sometimes repays dealers who make repairs on out-of-warranty parts, but an executive on Friday denied that the practice constitutes a `` secret warranty'' used to quiet customers who complain. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s national service operations manager, confirmed information from a 12-page <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> document published Friday in The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that lists 41 components for which <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> can be reimbursed by its Japanese parent company. The reimbursements let dealers provide free service on the components, but <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Giaquinta </PERSON> stressed that the list does not set guidelines on what work can be done free of charge. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> district offices decide what parts will be repaired or replaced without charge, he said. The document lists items including cracked dashboard pads, peeling blue paint, slipping automatic transmissions, worn engine cylinders, camshafts, cruise controls, catalytic converters, fuel pumps, and brakes. <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said a customer generally has to complain to get the free repairs. `` A dealer might point out to him that a component should n't have failed and offer to seek reimbursement from <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, but in most cases it would be up to the customer to request it,'' he said Most automakers long have acknowledged paying for selected post-warranty repairs to keep customers satisfied, but <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s list apparently is the longest made public, the newspaper said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, a public interest group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, called the policy a `` secret warranty'' used to quiet complaining customers while others who do not complain are charged for the same repairs. `` What they're doing is taking care of customers who are likely to cause them image problems by squawking too loudly, while ignoring thousands of others who do n't complain,'' <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> said. `` We do not have a secret warranty,'' <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> said. `` We make a case-by-case determination under our customer satisfaction policy whether to reimburse for a repair that occurs beyond the normal warranty.''

 Local officials have asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to investigate <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after a small plane crash killed three people, the latest in a string of accidents at the airport, a county spokesman said Friday. Meanwhile, federal investigators were at the printing shop that was destroyed when a twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerostar </ORGANIZATION> crashed shortly after takeoff Thursday and exploded into flames. All three people aboard the plane were killed. `` They are still there completing the on-scene investigation and getting ready to move some of the wreckage,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Prellezo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials also are examining the wreckage. Before Thursday's crash, four people had been killed in 16 accidents involving planes taking off or landing at the airport in this <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> suburb since 1982, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. The airport is used mainly by small planes. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> had agreed to the county <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an investigation. He also said the department had asked the national <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to examine the airport's operations. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said he was not aware of plans to investigate the airport. Nevertheless, he said a special <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection of the facility in May found fewer safety problems than a similar inspection a year before. County officials recently announced a $ 575,000 plan to add 1,000 feet to the 3,000-foot airport runways. `` This will put aircraft at a higher altitude when they cross the airport's boundaries, and this gives a pilot who gets in trouble the maneuverability area to possibly turn back to the airport,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Some residents of the densely populated neighborhoods surrounding the airport strongly oppose to the small aircraft traffic. `` I'm going to start a petition to get those small planes out of here,'' said real estate broker <PERSON> Jeanette </PERSON> <PERSON> Piazza </PERSON>. `` I'm serious about this.'' According to witnesses and <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> reports, the six-seat <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> circled several times before clipping power lines and plunging into a strip shopping plaza about a mile from the runway. `` He did n't get very high, maybe 100 to 150 feet at the most,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, an accident investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said no flight plan was filed and the plane's destination was unknown. But <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said flight plans are n't required for many local flights. The dead pilot was identified as <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, 55, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Lauderdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perry </LOCATION>. Names of his two passengers were not immediately released. A typesetter at the printing shop, <PERSON> Kelli </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, 24, suffered burns over 27 percent of her body and was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirando </PERSON>. Three other stores in the shopping center were destroyed. Officials estimate the damage at about $ 1 million. `` I'm a pilot myself,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON>. `` I know there's been a lot of problems at that airport and I do n't want it to look bad or I do n't want my husband to look bad.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers suffering drought losses will not be allowed to double up on benefits under ongoing emergency livestock feed provisions and the new disaster payment program, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Undersecretary <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON> said that if a farmer has a crop loss that would qualify him for both programs, he can not collect on the same loss twice. `` However, a livestock producer who has a loss of 1988 crop corn production could receive emergency livestock feed assistance based on part of his loss and disaster payments based on the remainder,'' <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON> said. The basic restrictions are spelled out by the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988. <PERSON> Vautour </PERSON> said the while the statutory provisions of the new law went into effect on Friday, the regulations and operating procedures which will implement these provisions have not been completed. `` Producers should start assembling their sales receipts and other data to substantiate their actual production information,'' he said. Department officials have said they hope to begin actual operation of the $ 3.9 billion drought-aid law by Oct. 1. At that time, they hope, farmers can begin applying at country offices of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for benefits.

 Besides the damage, the forest fires ravaging the nation's oldest park are giving those visitors who are still around a new persective on a landscape normally crowded with summer tourists. At Mud Volcano, an area of boiling cauldrons several miles north of Fishing Bridge, the smell of smoke from distant fires mingled with the stench of sulfer from the cauldrons. The fires have charred more than 400,000 acres of forest and forced large sections of the park to close. The parking lot for Mud Volcano is sprawling, but <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lanny </PERSON> <PERSON> Simcoff </PERSON> and their children were alone in it. One other small group was working its way along the boardwalk through the area. The family, from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, had planned to leave the community of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> on Wednesday and head south into Grand Teton National Park, but the fires closed the road to <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION>. `` We're going to go back to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> and rent a rowboat and row around by ourselves,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Simcoff </PERSON>. `` Actually, though, I kind of enjoy being alone in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> at the height of the tourist season.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> were staying at Fishing Bridge, a small resort on the north end of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> that has avoided the flames. `` We've been just enjoying ourselves on this side of the park,'' said <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` We'll do some fishing, go on a couple of hikes and make the best of a difficult situation.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, assistant manager of the general store at Fishing Bridge, shook his head at his almost empty store, which had roughly a dozen people in it Friday morning. `` Normally, the first three weeks in August are peak season,'' said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> is a ranger-naturalist who has been turned into a media escort. Once the fires are gone she'll have a new lesson to impart on park visitors. `` We'll tell people about what happened this summer, about it being an usually dry year and about Park Service policy on fires,'' she said. `` And we'll talk a lot about fire ecology and hopefully give people walks through some of the fire areas and compare them with some of the unburned areas. `` It will be a real good opportunity to see the changes that take place,'' <PERSON> Snell </PERSON> added. `` It's like a living laboratory.

 Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on Friday, the end of a five-day visit, and contended that most blacks support the measures. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an Illinois Democrat who ran unsuccessfully earlier this year for his party's presidential nomination, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the responsibility to protest <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of race discrimination. Referring to silence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> first began persecuting Jews, he said, `` We do n't want to repeat that.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on African affairs and will have a major role in debate on pending legislation to stiffen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions. At a news conference Friday <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should wait for greater political change before easing sanctions even if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white authorities free <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader who is serving a life prison sentence. `` One of the ways that dismay will be expressed is through sanctions, by my country and increasingly by other nations also,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` We find no pleasure in imposing sanctions. It is not done as punishment, but as the only clear signal we know how to send that we want this great country of yours to also become a just country.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> met with both government and opposition leaders during his tour. He said some blacks he met opposed sanctions, but he said a majority support them. Many Americans who oppose sanctions say they hurt South African blacks more than the government, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has made similar arguments. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. Government officials say they are pursuing gradual race reforms and will not be hurried by sanctions. The sanctions approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 forbid all new public and private loans to this nation and bar trade in certain products.

 A rape victim's parents said Friday they were so outraged by the assault on their daughter that they had no choice but to pursue her attacker for more than a year. Their persistence led to the arrest of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Biddings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, who was indicted Friday in the rape of the daughter and four other women and girls. Police said he is a suspect in as many as five dozen attacks attributed to the so-called handcuff rapist. `` That is every parent's first reaction: ` I'll go out and get the person who did this to my child,''' said the mother. `` But the feeling never left me, and I always had a very strong premonition that he would return.'' Police said the woman, standing at the same bus stop where her daughter was attacked in June 1987, acted as a decoy while her armed husband watched and waited in the dark. The couple, who agreed to a news conference on the condition they not be identified, said they staked out the spot only a few times before the wife was attacked Aug. 5. She was grabbed from behind, carried to a nearby yard and thrown to the ground before her husband managed to frighten the man off. The couple got a license number that led to Biddings' arrest. Biddings, 34, was charged by the grand jury with 12 counts of rape, six counts of kidnapping, two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of felonious assault in connection with the attack on the mother and the rapes of her daughter and four others. Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the investigation is continuing and more charges could be brought. The nickname `` handcuff rapist'' resulted from the use of handcuffs early in the four-year series of attacks. At the news conference, the couple sat, nervous and unsmiling but holding hands, as reporters questioned them. Their 23-year-old daughter was with them, and all three were hidden from television cameras by a screen. The mother said she and her husband decided to go looking for their daughter's attacker shortly after the incident occurred. She said she was never afraid during the stakeouts. `` I was furious,'' she said. Her husband said police discouraged both of them. `` I was not hesitant at taking the law into my own hands,'' he said. `` Me and my wife had concerns, we had talked about it for numerous, numerous hours ... the dangers of it. I made a serious attempt at discouraging her from doing it.'' Their daughter said she had no idea what her parents were doing, initially. `` After I found out, I was very scared for them, and I was upset that my mother was hurt over this,'' she said. `` I'm very proud of them, however.'' The courthouse news conference was arranged by the prosecutor's office In addition to media inquiries, the office said it had also been deluged by people interested in producing a television movie about the case. `` I do n't understand all the attention, actually,'' the mother said. `` We're private people. We did what we had to do and do n't feel we should get any credit for doing anything We're embarrassed I'm very embarrassed.'' Although their persistence paid off, the couple said they would discourage others from doing the same. `` It's very dangerous. Everything went wrong. It did n't happen the way it was supposed to,'' the mother said. `` He was n't supposed to get his hands on me. I could have been killed.'' But their daughter said the arrest encouraged her. `` It makes me feel like there is hope,'' the daughter said. `` Never give up on your police and not to be afraid to step forward ... because even though he has assaulted you and it's all said and done, maybe you can stop him from assaulting someone else and stop someone else from going through the pain.''

 The fiery sorghum liquor maotai no longer will be served at state banquets, the official media said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, the news agency, said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has decided to stop serving hard liquor at banquets for foreign dignitaries. Only wines were served Thursday night at a dinner given by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> for Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the report said. The government is conducting a campaign against public waste and extravagance. The banquet, a popular function in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, is a prime target. Menus now are to be held to four courses, not the customary 10 or 15, and feasting is expected to end in 1 -LCB- hours. The rule on liquor follows removal of price controls on maotai and other liquors, which caused huge price increases. A bottle of maotai, previously set at $ 5.40 but accessible only to people with good connections, now costs more than $ 40.

<HEAD>Experts Say Seals Not Killed By Virus</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with higher estimate of dead seals,

<TEXT>
 Researchers have determined something other than a viral epidemic killed thousands of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> seals, but a government spokesman making the announcement Friday refused to give the cause. Officials in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said seals had begun to die in British waters and estimated more than 10,000 of the marine mammals have died in recent months. If accurate, that estimate would represent a major increase in the number. Scientists elsewhere in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have estimated the number about 3,000 lower. Animal health experts and environmentalists had speculated chemical pollution in the water may have lowered the seals' ability to fight disease. The <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> has determined what caused the seal deaths and is working on a cure, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity. She said the researchers would disclose their findings next week. Neither the herpes nor the picorna viruses widely held responsible for the seal deaths are the main cause, the spokeswoman said, adding that the findings resulted from months of research by the institute and the <ORGANIZATION> Seal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in the nothern Dutch village of <LOCATION> Pieterburen </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s biggest hospital for seals. She said the researchers `` have proved it was one definite factor'' that killed the seals. Although other factors may have contributed to the disease, the spokeswoman said, `` it was the straw that broke the camel's back. ... All the dead seals had it.'' The disease apparently undermines the mammals' disease-fighting immune system and they usually die of pneumonia or liver infection. `` Whether environmental pollution has played a role I do n't know,'' she said. According to the spokewoman, the researchers are expecting to disclose details of a possible cure for the disease when they publish their findings Thursday in the British scientific magazine Nature. `` All I'm allowed to say is that I'm very happy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Seal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Lenie </PERSON>' t <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> Since May 1, a total of 216 seals died along <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s coasts and 18 perished killed off <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, officials of the government-run <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Officials of the council's <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mammal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said more than 10,000 seals have died in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. They estimated the world population at 500,000. Previous estimates said up to 3,500 seals have died in West German coastal waters and 3,000 more deaths had cut the Danish seal population in half. More than 800 were reported to have died off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it had organized a conference for next Tuesday to formulate plans to handle the immediate problems created by dead and dying seals.

 <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s apology for supporting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War has failed to impress the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who voted to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to try her for treason. During their 89th annual convention this week, 13,400 VFW delegates adopted three resolutions concerning <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, including one saying `` a mere apology is not enough to redeem the situation.'' The VFW also denounced her upcoming movie `` Union Street,'' and called for her `` to be tried by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government as a traitor.'' The last resolution passed unanimously by voice vote. `` How do you go back 20 years and make amends?'' VFW spokesman <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Pall </PERSON> said. `` What is this woman really after? This is no way to redeem the hurt and pain she caused those troops in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, an ardent opponent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, took a highly publicized trip to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> in 1972. Last June, at her request, she appeared on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> program `` 20-20,'' saying she was `` very sorry for some of what I did.'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s publicist, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, said Friday from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> stated in 1972 that <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> had n't done anything wrong.'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> reached an out-of-court settlement with the federal government in 1979 in which she agreed not to press a $ 1 million lawsuit, in exchange for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s admission that it spied on her improperly and its promise to adhere to <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> guidelines in the future. One resolution passed by the group Wednesday said the VFW `` is not insensitive to a sincere expression of contrition.'' `` But the VFW wants to be assured that the ` apology' is not simply a means of bolstering her sagging career and political fortunes,'' it said. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s husband, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Assemblyman and former anti-war activist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, has faced similar campaigns, including an unsuccessful attempt by veterans groups to have him ousted from the legislature as a `` traitor'' in 1986.

 Two bombs jolted the Moslem part of the city Friday and residents joined a strike against what they view as <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias blocking election of a pro-Syrian president. The bombs exploded in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in the early evening within hours of each other, police said, but no casualties were reported. One went off at a garbage dump and the other in a narrow street off a commercial district. They shattered windows and wrecked shutters of shops in both areas. No group claimed responsibility. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops what they suspected of being a car bomb but the vehicle did not contain explosives. The strike closed government offices, banks, shops, restaurants, gasoline stations, amusement centers and other businesses in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and areas policed by Syrian soldiers. Sponsors said bakeries, pharmacies, hospitals and the news media were exempt. However, life was normal in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the 385-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the capital, police said. The Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia, opposed the strike and a spokesman described it as `` a reflection of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s hegemony. `` The Syrians have forced their surrogates to call the strike after the defeat of their candidate in the first round of the presidential elections,'' the Lebanese Forces official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker. It has 40,000 soldiers stationed in the north and south and in sections of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Parliament failed Aug. 18 to muster the needed quorum to elect a president. The only serious candidate was <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s closest Christian ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and a personal friend of Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. Leftists and Moslem militia leaders have blamed <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to elect <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, 78, on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Israeli opposition <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leading independent daily paper An-Nahar said last week the quorum was not achieved because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposed the election of a `` confrontational candidate.'' Several businessmen in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> voiced doubt that the strike would lead to the election of a new head of state before the six-year term of President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> expires Sept. 23. `` This is playacting,'' said a grocer who identified himself only as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musbah </PERSON>. `` I do n't believe that a president brought in by a strike would be good for a country which has been on strike for years.'' He was referring to the 13-year-old civil war, which has claimed more than 130,000 lives and shattered the nation's economy, once the most flourishing in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said Fijian soldiers found the red <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> deserted a few yards from their checkpoint and reported it was rigged with `` a quantity of explosives.'' The peacekeepers' Swedish engineers fired two anti-tank shells at the car almost seven hours after it was discovered deserted, the spokesman said. `` The shells exploded destroying the vehicle. There was no other explosion, apparently the car did n't contain any explosives,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops sealed off the area and blocked traffic along the coastal highway south of the port of Tyre after the car was discovered.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemned on Friday the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, expressing deep dismay over their `` more intense and frequent'' use against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The 15 council members voted unanimously to condemn the use of chemical weapons a violation of a 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol. The British-sponsored resolution did not name <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as the attacker but cited reports by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chemical weapons experts accusing the government in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> of using poison gas, including a mustard gas attack on an Iranian city Aug. 2. At that time, both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had accepted <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598 demanding a cease-fire in the 8-year-old war, but no truce date had been set. Peace talks opened Thursday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A Kurdish guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, claims <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped poison gas bombs on six Kurdish villages in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that day. Kurds have been fighting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> for more than 50 years for a separate homeland. Sir <PERSON> Crispin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There are extremely delicate discussions taking place in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> at the moment. We would not wish to do anything to upset those discussions. `` The resolution makes perfectly clear in the preamble who we think has been using chemical weapons, and I think it's best for the moment to leave it at that.'' The preamble notes the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is `` deeply dismayed by the -LRB- investigative -RRB- missions' conclusions that there had been continued use of chemical weapons in the conflict between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and that such use against Iranians had become more intense and frequent.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> admitted last month that it had used chemical weapons, but claimed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used them first. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it has the ability to produce such weapons but has not done so. The resolution asked other nations to halt the export of chemicals used to produce such weapons, and encouraged Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to promptly investigate allegations of the use of chemical weapons. It noted the continuing negotiations of the Conference on Disarmament in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on banning the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and arranging the destruction of current stockpiles. The 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol bans the use of chemical and biological weapons but does not prohibit their manufacture. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed a similar resolution in May, but that one did not specifically cite the use of chemical weapons against Iranians. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> released a report by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigators that blamed <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for using mustard gas Aug. 2 in an air raid on <LOCATION> Oshnaviyah </LOCATION>, an Iranian city near the northeast corner of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts found chemical and medical evidence of mustard gas use, and found splinters of shells similar to those found after attacks on Iranian civilians in 1984, 1986, 1987 and earlier this year, `` indicating their utilization during an Iraqi air attack on Oshnaviyeh.'' Iranian authorities said the air raid injured 2,680 civilians. No deaths were reported. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts interviewed 24 patients who were still hospitalized when they visited the areas Aug. 12-14. Council members stood for a minute of silence at the opening of their meeting Friday in memory of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, who died in a plane crash Aug. 17.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief recessed <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> peace talks Friday for a day of `` reflection'' after a four-hour session during which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> apparently took uncompromising positions on how define their common border. `` I hope that on Sunday, after reflection, flexibility perhaps will start,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told reporters after presiding over a joint session with the two delegations. `` We are making progress slowly, but we are trying.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, first raised the border problem in a brief public statement Friday, the second day of talks which are expected to last months, if not years. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> insists that implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution 598, which provides for withdrawal of forces `` to internationally recognized boundaries,'' be based on a 1975 treaty between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. That treaty was aimed at settling centuries of border disputes between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> repudiated it on Sept. 17, 1980, five days before Iraqi forces invaded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> following border clashes. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants the peace talks to include a renegotiation of the border. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also made it plain that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants an independent body to be formed quickly to assign blame for the 8-year-old war, which claimed more than a million dead or wounded. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> expects the body to identify <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as the aggressor, a verdict that could also be the basis for reparation claims. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> called the 1975 treaty and an `` outline plan'' prepared by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> for putting the treaty into effect `` vital criteria'' for reaching peace. The most controversial part of the 1975 treaty made the southern boundary between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> the middle of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only access to the sea at the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The treaty granted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> its claim to the eastern half of the 127-mile waterway. A major cause of the war was the dispute over the <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON>. The truce continued to hold meanwhile, but guerrilla groups from both sides traded new accusations of government-ordered massacres. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemned the use of chemical weapons in the war, expressing deep dismay over their `` more intense and frequent'' use against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The British-sponsored resolution, adopted unanimously by the 15-member council, did not name <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as the attacker, but cited reports by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chemical weapons experts blaming <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> for using poison gas, including a mustard gas attack on the Iranian city of <LOCATION> Oshnaviyah </LOCATION> on Aug. 2. After Thursday's two-hour opening talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, face-to-face talks were abandoned temporarily and both sides stayed in separate chambers, with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials meeting them and reporting back to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. But Friday afternoon, both parties met again in joint session. Outside the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> complex, about 200 exiled Iraqi Kurds protested <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons and waved banners demanding, `` Stop the massacre of Kurds.'' A Kurdish guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, charged that six <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air force planes dropped poison gas bombs on Kurdish villages in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Thursday, the day the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks started. A spokesman who telephoned the <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> bureau of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said that 88 civilians were killed and 500 were injured. Moslems attending the Friday prayer service in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s imposing, Saudi-financed mosque passed a large colored poster illustrating the chemical bombing of the Iraqi Kurdish town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said killed 5,000 people last March Iraq-based Iranian guerrillas, meanwhile, accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of killing political prisoners. <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajavi </PERSON>, leader of the Iranian People's <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, called on <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to send a mission to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to halt an `` accelerated pace of killings.'' He charged Iranian authorities arrested more than 10,000 people on political charges in the past few weeks and that hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers were executed.

 A jury Friday convicted a man of murdering and dismembering a prostitute whose remains were discovered three years later, stuffed in a back porch freezer. The 12-member panel later returned to deliberations and unanimously recommended <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> be electrocuted for the March 1985 slaying of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a jury recommendation is not binding on the judge, who in capital cases has the final say between life in prison and death. Hillsborough Circuit Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazzara </PERSON> set sentencing for Sept. 26. The jury convicted <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> after more than five hours deliberations over two days. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, 27, was shot once in the back of the head. Her limbs and head were then severed with a power saw. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s 14-year-old daughter tipped police after she and a friend found the frozen body on the family's cluttered back porch in March. The state argued that <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> was killed because she was dealing drugs for <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and he thought she had cheated him. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON>, 26, a two-time <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> felon with an admitted drug problem, testified for the prosecution that he helped hold the woman at <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s home while she was beaten and raped by <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and co-defendant <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, a 28-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> Martins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferry </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, resident who is schedued for trial on the same charges later this year. <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, on <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s orders, shot Ms. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> held down her arms and <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> laid across her legs. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> then cut off her arms, legs and head with a power saw, <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> was promised 25 years probation in a plea bargain with prosecutors for his testimony. `` It must be clear to you that I do n't like making deals with people like Mr. <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON>,'' Assistant Hillsborough State Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> told jurors in closing arguments. `` I made a deal with this guy so you would hear what Mr. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> did to <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>. I think you needed to know that.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> noted that after <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> was arrested in March authorities had only a circumstantial case until <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON> voluntarily contacted police four months later and offered details. `` He probably knew there was a body in the freezer. He must have,'' <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> said in his closing statement. `` But that does n't mean he killed it ... Whoever killed her loathed her ... For you to convict my client on <PERSON> Whyte </PERSON>'s testimony is preposterous.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> did not take the stand.

<TEXT>
 A British newspaper reported Friday that the Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, said to have been wrapped around <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> after his crucifixion, is a fake but experts discounted the newspaper report as unsubstantiated rumor. `` As yet, we do not have a final figure,'' Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> said Friday night in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The 14-foot cloth kept in <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> bears the image of a bearded, crucified man. Tite is coordinater of radio-carbon dating tests made on the cloth by <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. He said results from each testing center have been circulated to the others `` with a proposal for a coordinated date on the shroud from the samples, but I have n't heard from anyone as of yet.'' Tite is keeper of the British Museum's research laboratory and supervised the <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> tests. The London Evening Standard reported without attribution Friday that radio-carbon dating tests conducted by scientists at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> showed the shroud was made about 1350. However, it quoted Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Magdalene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, as saying: `` I think that as far as seems possible the scientific argument is now settled and the shroud is a fake. I suppose there will be certain people who will never believe it but it seems unlikely'' that the tests could be 1,300 years off. `` This report is without any serious foundation,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Holy Shroud of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, established 10 years ago to pursue investigations into the cloth. `` There have been so many of these type of reports and they're all rumors It's all got totally out of hand.'' All three institutions conducting tests agreed to keep their findings secret and forward them to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for an official announcement in September or early October. Both <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON> and Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, head of the radio-carbon dating laboratory at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> which was responsible for the tests, were unavailable for comment Friday. <PERSON> Luckett </PERSON>, whose university is an ancient rival of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, was not connected with the tests but has been associated with investigations of its history. In <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION>, Professor <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON>, the liaison between Cardinal <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballestrero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> and the three laboratories, said he had received no word from <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and was `` amazed'' by the Evening Standard report. <PERSON> Gonella </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> scientists made blind-tests on three samples. `` They were asked to date the three samples, not to determine which of them belongs to the shroud,'' he said. He confirmed that the Oxford experiments were completed but said results would n't be released until after scientists from the three laboratories met to coordinate them. <PERSON> Tite </PERSON> said earlier Friday that an announcement on results `` will be made in September or early October by <LOCATION> Turin </LOCATION> via the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> press office.'' He said each laboratory received three samples of cloth, but were not told what they were. He said samples were taken from the shroud and from medieval and other cloths. `` It was blind-testing,'' he said. Announcement of the results is expected to come from <LOCATION> Ballestrero </LOCATION>, who authorized thumbnail-size samples to be cut from the shroud kept in his cathedral. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> geoscientist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Damon </PERSON> and physicist <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> headed the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> study of the shroud, but declined comment. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said she was `` pretty sure our guys do not know the results from the other institutions,'' and that the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> scientists `` just ca n't make any comments until it's the official announcment. They will not comment on any rumors.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said she had spoken with Tite, who `` assures me that they have not released any information.''

He told an Italian television interviewer Thursday that falsehoods had been written about the situation in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> but the censorship was a mistake. <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Jallab </PERSON>, acting undersecretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday: `` We do not have censorship, and we do not believe in its effectiveness.'' Information Minister el-Sayed <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, ordered foreign journalists and photographers Wednesday to take pictures and interviews only while accompanied by a ministry representative. He also said news or photos could not be sent from <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> without a censor's stamp. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> `` is a free country with an independent judiciary'' and anyone whose rights are violated by the press has recourse to the courts. <PERSON> Jallab </PERSON>, interviewed in English, said Friday: `` The prime minister is the highest executive ... so his statement would eventually cancel any previous measures.'' Sudanese officials, including the prime minister have denounced stories in foreign news media attributing corruption and incompetence to the relief effort for 1.5 million people left homeless by three weeks of flooding in the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Jallab </PERSON> said no journalist had been censored and none would be. He said ministry representatives assigned to accompany photographers and television crews were there to help with logistics, not to censor. `` We are only facilitating their missions. We do not tell them what to do,'' <PERSON> Jallab </PERSON> said. `` One of the reasons that led to the ouster of the former regime was the lack of press freedom.'' The measures <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> outlined were similar to those in effect during most of the 16-year rule of <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, whose presidency ended in a military coup in April 1985. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON>'s civilian government took over a year later and has maintained some of the most liberal press laws in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 A defendant in what is believed to be the longest federal criminal trial in American history wanted special consideration because of his sleep disorder, so he asked the judge about his `` sleeping motion.'' `` I thought we had put that to bed,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> replied to the laughter and groans of the defendants and attorneys in his <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> courtroom. On another day, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> angered some when he called one motion `` creative nonsense at best.'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, 60, spent nearly two years with the Herculean task of handling the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> v. Accetturo, et al. case. The trial ended Friday when the jury, after 21 months of proceedings but only 14 hours of deliberations, acquitted all 20 defendants of racketeering charges. The defendants, alleged to be members of the Lucchese crime family, had been charged with organized crime activities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. During the trial, 20 litigators, including some of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s most highly regarded lawyers, and two defendants representing themselves filled <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>'s courtroom He acted as referee to a throng of egos, and sometimes one of his toughest tasks was just keeping the courtroom quiet. He made more than 100 rulings on legal motions. Legal papers from the case fill 15 feet of file drawers. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>'s judicial record includes a landmark decision in a civil racketeering case brought by the government against Teamsters Local 560. In 1984, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> local had been dominated by organized crime for a quarter century and placed it under a trustee's control, the first such action in the nation. Earlier this year, because of comments he had made in news reports in his typically outspoken fashion, ousted union officials sought to have <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> removed from the case. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused. At about the same time, the appellate court was considering another <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> matter. The judge had ordered a lawyer and his firm back into the Lucchese trial after a key defendant's attorney contracted cancer. The lawyer fought his appointment in appeals to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and lost. Along the way, though, the 3rd Circuit mildly chided <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> for the `` leisurely pace'' of the trial. The judge then lengthened trial days and reduced delays. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he received his law degree in 1951. The former sportswriter served as a judge in the state Division of Workmen's Compensation and was a state judge in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> before President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> nominated him for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1980.

<TEXT>
 Opposition lawmakers showed up Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> for a continuing session to certify the results of July elections, and a governing party leader threatened to go ahead without them if necessary. Opposition deputies had walked out of the session early Thursday to protest what they view as the governing party's unwillingness to check reports of voting fraud in the elections. They returned to the chamber Thursday afternoon. Lawmakers pledged Friday to work round-the-clock if need be to install a new national House of Deputies in time for outgoing president <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>'s state-of-the union address Thursday to a joint session of lawmakers. The political sparring reflects a new atmosphere resulting from the elections. The opposition made major gains against the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, which has dominated national politics for nearly 50 years. President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> is expected on Sept. 1 to formally present his successor elected in July, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> officially takes over for a single six-year term in December. Opposition leaders say the voting was riddled with fraud and challenge the official results that give <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> a victory with 50 percent of the vote. His two leading challengers have barnstormed the country urging people to reject the election results. `` The pressure for time is on, and this will oblige the deputies to sit continuously in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' congressional spokesman <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> said a majority of deputies had agreed to stay round-the-clock in permanent session through the weekend if necessary to certify the vote count. The proceedings have unfolded in a raucous atmosphere, with opposition sympathizers chanting, whistling, and throwing coins and other objects from the public galleries. The session resumed Friday with all public but the news media excluded. The deputies are sitting as an electoral college to certify the results of their own elections, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members have been doing the same. The House later will certify the presidential vote count. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> bloc, told reporters that if necessary, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> can muster a bare majority of one vote, install the lower chamber and proceed with business without the opposition. According to the preliminary vote count, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> should get 247 of 500 House seats and the opposition 227, with 26 seats undecided. The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> has never lost a major election since it was formed in 1929 years ago and usually won the presidential race by more than 70 percent of the votes cast. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a dissident who broke away from the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> in November to demand a cleaner electoral process, came in second on the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> ticket with 31 percent. He claims he actually won the election. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> came in third with 17 percent. Also, for the first time in six decades, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> lost four seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ all to the <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> coalition.

<HEAD>Homeless Author Is Offered Shelter by Widow of Violin Thief</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A best-selling author whose hard luck has forced him to live out of his van was offered shelter by the widow of a man who harbored a famous stolen violin for almost 50 years. <PERSON> Marcelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said Friday she tracked down <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, author of `` The Graduate,'' and his ex-wife wife at a western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> motel earlier this week and offered to take them in after reading of their plight. `` I jumped right to the phone as if some power was leading me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I saw their picture and I thought, ` They probably do the same things I do, give it all away, and sometimes you get shafted.''' She said she hoped <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> would write a book about the stolen violin and how she came to be married to the man who held it for a half-century. But <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s ex-wife, who uses only the name <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and who continues to live with him, said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> might not be able to write such a book. `` The only problem is that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> does n't know if he can write the story about the violin. He has n't written anything factual,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> gained national attention last year when she said her second husband, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, confessed before he died in Aug. 15, 1985, that his violin was a stolen Stradivarius he had bought for $ 100 from the man who had stolen it. The violin was stolen at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in 1936 from <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Huberman </PERSON>, an internationally known violinist who died in 1947. The violin was authenticated for its insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION>, which had paid $ 30,000 to <PERSON> Huberman </PERSON>. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> insured it for $ 800,000 and reportedly intended to sell it, and Mrs. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> was going to pay her a reward. Mrs. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said she met <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1968 and they married in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> in March 1985, two days before he was sentenced to two years in jail for sexually molesting one of her granddaughters. She said Friday that she had married him to regain control of her financial holdings. After serving four months of his sentence, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer and moved to a hospital where he died, Mrs. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s 1962 novel was made into the hit movie of the same name starring <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. The movie evoked the discontent of a generation fed up with materialism. He and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in search of a publisher after living for a decade in their van in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. In more prosperous days, the <ORGANIZATION> Webbs </ORGANIZATION> had given away two houses out of a need, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said, to `` get free of things.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> said the couple would drive to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> on Saturday to meet Mrs. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> and consider the offer. `` It sounds a little bit gothic, but we might be able to handle something like that,'' she said. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> wrote four novels until 1978, when he stopped writing. The <ORGANIZATION> Webbs </ORGANIZATION> divorced eight years ago after 20 years of marriage because they believed the institution of marriage violated their constitutional rights to freedom, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The president of a laboratory was arrested Friday and charged with illegally throwing medical waste in an open trash bin outside the office, authorities said. A 10-day surveillance of the medical lab uncovered garbage bags containing hypodermic needles and syringes, blood vials and other medical waste, said <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON>. Two of the blood vials were found to contain hepatitis B virus, she said. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Numeroff </PERSON>, 58, and his company, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, were charged with 21 misdemeanor counts including second-degree reckless endangerment and violations of the Public Health Law. The most serious charges carry a maximum prison term of one year in jail. The company and <PERSON> Numeroff </PERSON> also face criminal fines of up to $ 26,000 and thousands of dollars in civil penalties. <PERSON> Holtzman </PERSON> said that the needles and syringes found in the garbage bags were not broken or crushed to make them inoperable and were not placed in puncture-resistant containers as required by law. City Sanitation Commissioner <PERSON> Brendon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON> said his department received a tip Aug. 16 that medical waste at the lab was being disposed of in the sewer. Investigators found no evidence of that, but they did discover the garbage bags with medical waste in the trash container. Among the items found in the bags were 60 loose needles, an unspecified number of syringes, 25 urine samples, 15 blood vials and a scalpel blade. <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, when asked about the rash of medical waste found on beaches in the metropolitan area this summer, was not optimistic that authorities would find the source. `` We may never know,'' he said.

 The opening of `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was delayed Friday because someone broke into the movie theater, stole the film and slashed a screen, police said. The Centre Theatre canceled the first showing of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s film, but found another copy and held its second scheduled showing, said <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Detective Lt. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>. The movie also made its debut Friday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the heart of the Bible Belt, with about 300 protesters singing and praying outside. In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, 50 protesters sang hymns and preached in an attempt to dissuade the nearly 300 people who attended the first showing there. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the movie showed on two screens in a theater complex at <LOCATION> Phipps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, in trendy <LOCATION> Buckhead </LOCATION>, north of downtown. A short line began forming two hours before the first show, a mall official said. The movie opened last week in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, attracting hundreds of pickets. The previous week, the movie opened in seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, attracting thousands of demonstrators. Protesters have objected to the film's portrayal of Christ. The movie's last scene depicts Christ, while hanging on the cross, hallucinating about abandoning his role as Savior, having sex with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and raising a family. He rejects the temptation. The movie has been condemned by <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s predominant <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and other conservative religious denominations nationwide. Some groups have called for a boycott of the film, and of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, an employee at the theater referred questions to <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex-Odeon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Friendly </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, but a secretary said she had left the office for the day. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said there were signs that a side door to the downtown theater was forced. Inside, police found 5-foot-long slashes on the theater's screen. It was not known how the film was shown. Police had no suspects, <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said. `` I do n't understand what all the big deal is about,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said after watching the movie there. He said he had wanted to see it `` before all the hullabaloo started, but after that started I just wanted to see it more.'' The protesters marched, sang religious songs, prayed and held a rally in an area in front of the mall that had been cordoned off for them. Entertainer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for an appearance at an amusement park, stopped by. `` I do n't need to see the film,'' he told demonstrators. He said he had begun to read the novel on which the film is based years ago, `` and when I saw where it was going I put it down.'' Mall management not only cordoned off an area for the protesters, but also provided them with portable lavatories and power for their sound system. `` It's because we realize everyone in this issue has rights,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> MSA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Managment </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the mall. Craft said business had not been hurt by the controversy. `` If anything, business is up.''

<HEAD>Court Rejects Government Bid to Transfer Black City to Homeland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court rejected a government bid Friday to merge the country's second-largest black township with an impoverished homeland 180 miles away. The union, decreed by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> last December, met widespread opposition among the half-million residents in the township of <LOCATION> Botshabelo </LOCATION>. Many feared the government would declare the distant homeland, Qwaqwa, to be independent and deprive them of South African citizenship. Botshabelo, comprised mostly of clusters of shanties spread across a treeless plain, is in <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, the most sparsely populated and conservative of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s four provinces. A three-judge panel of the provincial <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declared <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s proclamation invalid Friday, saying it would not promote the political development of <PERSON> Botshabelo </PERSON>'s residents. The government issued no statement after the ruling, made in response to a case brought by township resident <PERSON> Gauta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefuo </PERSON>. The government can appeal the ruling. Governing officials said the merger is compatible with their longstanding policy of locating black ethnic groups in self-governing or nominally independent homelands. Botshabelo is made up predominantly of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sotho </LOCATION> people, as is <LOCATION> Qwaqwa </LOCATION>. But the judges said there were few similarities between <LOCATION> Botshabelo </LOCATION> and Qwaqwa, aside from ethnicity. Established nine years ago, <PERSON> Botshabelo </PERSON> has been depicted by anti-apartheid activists as a dumping ground for blacks not needed or wanted in the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. Most of its residents were expelled from white-owned farms. The homeland policy is part of the nation's policy of racial segregation known as apartheid. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. After pamphlets were dropped from security force helicopters announcing the merger, nine Botshabelo clergymen wrote to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. They warned that the situation was `` a recipe for frustration and resultant violence.'' `` It is unfeasible that one of the poorest self-governing states should administer and develop the second-largest black township in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the clergymen said. <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, is the largest black township in the country. The judgment marked the second major court defeat this year for the government's policy of homeland consolidation. The country's highest court, the Appeal Court, ruled last April that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had acted without proper authority when he incorporated the 120,000-member community of <LOCATION> Moutse </LOCATION> into the adjoining, semi-autonomous homeland of <LOCATION> KwaNdebele </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Most Moutse residents do not belong to the <LOCATION> Ndebele </LOCATION> tribe that predominates in <LOCATION> KwaNdebele </LOCATION>.

Lawyers for Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> had asked for dismissal on the grounds that Vice Adm. N.R. Thunman, chief of naval education and training, was biased against <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> in convening the court-martial and had tried to influence its outcome. Defense lawyers cited the admiral's comments to news media <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s family and a congressional committee. But the judge, Cmdr. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON>, ruled that <PERSON> Thunman </PERSON>'s statements were non-prejudicial `` He never indicated any culpability by any one with regard to the death,'' <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON> said. Also Friday, <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s lawyers exercised their right to have the case decided by a panel of officers rather than the judge, and four officers were selected. They will hear opening statements and initial testimony Saturday in a trial that will last at least through Monday, <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was in charge of the school at <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> on March 2 when <PERSON> Airman </PERSON> <PERSON> Recruit </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died after he panicked, climbed out of a swimming pool and shouted that he wanted to quit. Instructors allegedly pushed <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into the water and held his head under until he collapsed and died from a fear-induced heart attack or drowning. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, who was talking on the telephone in his office overlooking the pool at the time, is accused of failing to safeguard the physical well-being of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> and other subordinates. The prosecution contends he should have prevented the use of unsafe and unlawful force and had failed to establish policies banning the use of force and recognizing the right of students to drop out. In arguments on the admissibility of certain evidence, Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leighton </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s lawyers, argued that using force on students was crucial to proper training. Since <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death, instructors have been prohibited from touching students. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> is one of two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men being court-martialed in the case. If convicted, he could face a letter of reprimand, loss of seniority for promotion and forfeiture of two-thirds of his pay for three months, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON>, a public affairs officer. Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 26, a instructor from <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, is to be tried on charges of involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery. His trial was scheduled to begin Monday but will be delayed until <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s case is concluded <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>'s former boss, now-retired Capt. C.L. <PERSON> Lavinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> at the time of the death, received a letter of reprimand for dereliction of duty. Four other enlisted instructors were given non-judicial punishment of fines and in two cases reductions in rank. Four supervisory personnel, one an officer and three of enlisted men, were given non-punitive letters of caution.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> continues to suffer from mild hearing loss in his left ear and moderate hearing loss in his right ear, his physicians reported Friday. `` There has been no change in the president's hearing deficit in the past ten years,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> physician Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON> said in a statement issued following <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s annual hearing examination. The exam was conducted at the president's penthouse suite in the Century Plaza Hotel. The statement said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s two hearing aids also were checked and `` are working perfectly.'' The president wears hearing aids in both ears and he `` continues to have the same mild hearing loss in the left ear and moderate hearing loss in the right ear that he has had on previous examinations,'' the statement said. The president was examined by three physicians, including his longtime ear, nose and throat specialist, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> started to use a new type of hearing aid last year and he has had no complaints. He can adjust the volume by using a credit card-size control. Earlier Friday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president's allergist had determined there has been no essential change in his sensitivity to pollen. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who receives weekly shots to control the allergy, has been undergoing a battery of annual checkups in the midst of his traditional August vacation. The president was examined Thursday by his longtime allergist Dr. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookman </PERSON>, and the checkup `` was routine,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is spending a week of his August vacation here with his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. Outside of appearing at campaign rallies for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., the president has left his suite only for private dinners with old friends in the evenings The Reagans are scheduled to return to their ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> on Saturday after attending fund-raising events for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and for Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, R-Calif. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the party event, in <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, will be attended by 350 to 400 people who either contributed or gathered $ 5,000 per person for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign coffers About 1,000 people, contributing $ 200 apiece, were to attend the fund-raiser for <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anthropologist and two <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> Indian chiefs were arraigned Friday on charges of engaging in illegal political activities and could be expelled from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and chiefs <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON> and Kube-I of the <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> tribe were accused of breaking <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Foreigners Law during a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year The law, passed in 1980 when <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> was under a military government, prohibits non-Brazilian residents or visitors from speaking out publicly on domestic political issues. The trial has caused a sensation here. It is first time native Indians have been legally considered foreigners. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>'s lawyer, well-known human rights defender <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, said Friday the trial was suspended `` at least until December'' because <PERSON> Kube-I </PERSON> had returned to his village for the harvest and festival period and refused to show up at court. The court gave Kube-I 90 days to present himself for arraignment. `` This is a landmark case. I've been studying native peoples for 24 years, and this is the first time a native group has been considered foreign by a white government,'' <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said by telephone from his office in <LOCATION> Belem </LOCATION>, a city at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> 2,140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. He said the two <LOCATION> Kayapo </LOCATION> chiefs were invited by <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to speak about forest conservation. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, who has lived and worked in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> since 1977, said he went along as a friend and interpreter. `` They -LRB- the two Indians -RRB- said they were worried about deforestation in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>, erosion, mercury pollution from gold mining, and hydroelectric projects that displace Indian tribes. They're especially upset at the <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION> project that will inundate about ... -LRB- 18.8 million acres -RRB- of land, mostly Indian territory,'' <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said. The Kayapos number about 5,500 and live in the southern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. Environmental groups later invited <PERSON> Paiakan </PERSON> and Kube-I to speak to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The bank suspended funding for the Xingu project. Many Brazilians believe the Indians were responsible for blocking the project, but <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said funding already had been suspended because of financing problems with the government power company Eletronorte. The trial began Friday in <LOCATION> Belem </LOCATION> at the 3rd <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Para </ORGANIZATION>, a northern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle state. If found guilty, the three face a prison term of up to three years each and expulsion from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. It was not clear where the Indians could be expelled to. `` That's a very interesting question. But it's the government's problem,'' <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said Legally, Indians are wards of the state and do n't have the full rights of other citizens. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said he felt the trial was an attempt by the government to intimidate scientists and native Indians and keep them from speaking out on politically sensitive issues. `` No matter what the outcome of the trial is, the effects will be very unpleasant. I am prohibited from working in any <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> area as long as the case is pending. My work is paralyzed,'' he said. The Foreigners Law was enacted and often used by the military governments that ruled <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> from 1964 to 1985. Foreign priests and students who spoke out about political affairs were charged and sometimes expelled from the country. However, this is the first time the law has been used since <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> returned to civilian rule in 1985 under President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> said he was n't afraid of being expelled. `` If I'm found guilty ... I would n't want to stay here any more.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it is investigating apparent sabotage of O-rings destined for space shuttle booster rockets, a problem a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official said may have been motivated by a company incentive program. The defects were detected before any damaged rings were sent to the rocket maker. A `` very small number'' of O-rings that appeared to have been deliberately cut were discovered in June by the manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> HydraPak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the incident was immediately reported to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, and rocket maker <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON>, <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON> vice president of operations. He said a check showed none of the flawed seals was shipped to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. `` These things are inspected more times than you can hardly believe. But it's a serious nature. This O-ring has a great deal of visibility in the space program and around the world, and we can understand that. They are handled very carefully,'' <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said. However, television station <ORGANIZATION> KTVX </ORGANIZATION> quoted a former <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> employee Friday night as saying one deliberately cut O-ring was placed in a rocket segment under assembly at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was there when they received the damaged O-ring, and it was labeled from HydraPak, and it was in a package that had gone through quality assurance at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the unnamed worker. The man said when he called attention to the flawed seal he was told to keep quiet because the exposure could cause further delays in the space shuttle program. <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> denied the allegations, saying, `` No unacceptable component has either been delivered to us or been delivered by us for use in the shuttle program.'' The company conducts extensive `` acceptance inspections'' of any parts intended for flight hardware, and records of those inspections show there was `` virtually no possibility that any damaged O-ring has ever gotten into the flight hardware,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. A faulty O-ring that allowed super-hot exhaust gases to escape sideways through a joint and ignite the shuttle's exterior fuel tank was blamed by a presidential commission for the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion, which killed the craft's seven-member crew and grounded the nation's shuttle program. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said some HydraPak employees are suspected of damaging O-rings to receive bonuses awarded to workers who found defects. `` My understanding is they tightened internal final inspection, incentivized it or came up with some kind of program to make sure -LRB- no flawed O-rings -RRB- got out,'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huntsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` After <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON> set up this internal thing, perhaps some employees may have been taking advantage of it. That's what's suspected Whether it's a fact, I do n't know. We're treating it as an internal HydraPak thing,'' he said. Under the incentive plan, workers reportedly were awarded points for finding defects missed in previous inspections. When they accumulated enough points, they received a cash bonus. However, the system was eliminated since the defects appeared, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> denied, however, that HydraPak employees were given a cash incentive and said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was `` either misinformed or misquoted.'' `` Employees do not benefit monetarily from finding a defect,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Asked if the company had a point-system incentive plan, <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said he could not comment. He did confirm a Times report that, in addition to the O-rings that were deliberately cut, several others were left in a curing oven believed to have been left deliberately on a hotter-than-normal setting. Former HydraPak inspector <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KSL-TV </ORGANIZATION> Friday that she discovered three O-rings with slash marks as early as May, but management was unable to determine who was responsible. After more cuts were found, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said she was asked to take a lie-detector test. `` I did. I had nothing to hide. I liked my job at that company. I took the test and I failed it. They came in and took me off my inspection,'' she said. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said that when cuts continued to surface in some O-rings, she was moved to a filing job and was asked by management to resign. <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said no employees were fired as a result of the investigations, but he would not say if any were disciplined. <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> said security at the suburban <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> plant was strict, including employee badges for admission and escorts for visitors. But <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> claimed security was lax and that anyone could walk into the plant. HydraPak, with offices solely in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, also produces various industrial seals and hydraulic components and employs about 85 people. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON> said his agency was investigating the possibility of sabotage, but he declined to elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> likewise refused to discuss the space agency's investigation. But he said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials believe none of the damaged O-rings ever made it to <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> and that their discovery would not affect shuttle launch plans. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> decided not to conduct an investigation because the company never received any damaged O-rings, said spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>. `` It's always upsetting to hear that someone may, for whatever reason, be deliberately damaging stuff that's intended for the space program. But we are satisfied that the steps taken by <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON> to resolve the situation are, in fact, adequate,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dockstader </PERSON> would not comment on <PERSON> HydraPak </PERSON>'s efforts to resolve the matter except to say the company had taken steps to prevent similar incidents in the future and `` the problem is now solved.'' The damaged rings were discovered by a HydraPak inspector, he said. Had the rings passed the company's inspection, however, they still would have been examined by resident inspectors from <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> and the federal <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. On Aug. 18, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiokol </PERSON> culminated a 2 -LCB- - year effort to overhaul the booster with an apparently successful test-firing of the redesigned rocket at the company's <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> plant 70 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The firing was the fifth and final qualifying test before the booster can be cleared for flight. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is expected next week to set a date for the launch of Discovery, the first post-Challenger mission. At the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center, engineers continued to troubleshoot two problems that cropped up during a test firing of Discovery's engines on Aug. 10. One involves a small leak of hydrogen in an area where fuel lines extend into the shuttle from the external fuel tank. The other is the sluggish behavior of three valves that control the flow of liquid oxygen into the orbiter.

 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s official resume says he was the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Consumer Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was created, state records show. The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effect July 1. Officials said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> served as chief investigator from July until mid-September, when he became administrative assistant to then-Gov. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitcomb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> biography, which his campaign is using as his official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971. `` He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the unit's first director and now an attorney in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. `` He was in fact the chief investigator. He helped get the unit set up. -LRB- But -RRB- it would not have been before 1971,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Friday in a telephone interview. `` We formally began operations July 1.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> conceded Friday that the resume entry was `` inaccurate'' and said his staff had written the document. `` If it indicated that, that is inaccurate. I did n't hold that job for two years,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters aboard his campaign plane. Earlier, however, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> called the revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> `` a cheap shot.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a 1969 graduate of <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was attending <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the time. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, then an editor with the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, helped arrange his job interview with the state. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> worked for <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s grandfather and publisher of the News. `` At no point in any of this did <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ask any favors or use any influence,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, now with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` He would n't have been hired as a chief investigator. He was hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of jobs on his merits. It's a nothing story,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>, the Attorney General at the time, recently had surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge who was then an assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, `` all complaints and inquiries were handled by me. The legal assistant assigned to me and utilized as my chief investigator was <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' Her statement was released by the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> campaign. The Consumer Protection Division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products, false claims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud. In 1980, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> referred to himself as a `` Vietnam-era veteran'' in campaign literature when he was running against three-term incumbent <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, dropped the reference after objections by some <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> combat veterans. In that same election, which he won, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was `` on active duty for several periods during his tenure'' in the Guard. The statement referred to periods when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was in basic training and 15 days of camp each summer.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Friday asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stop deporting Palestinians and expressed concern over growing violence in the Israeli-occupied territories.

In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a mob of Palestinians attacked a fellow Arab alleged to have cooperated with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, and news reports said another alleged collaborator opened fire a day earlier on a Palestinian mob that was blocking his way in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, wounding a teen-ager. The incidents were the latest in a series of Palestinian attacks on suspected collaborators, including three in the past week. Also Friday, 14-year-old <PERSON> Aymen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yammen </PERSON> died from a gunshot wound to the eye that he suffered during clashes last week in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of Tal, officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. The fatality raised the Palestinian death toll in the 8-month-old Arab uprising to 254. Four Israelis have also died. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the army closed a trade union for a year, alleging its members held meetings to initiate anti-Israeli protests, an army spokesman said. It was the 10th union to be closed since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right-wing Trade Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> accused Palestinian trade unions of acting as `` cover-ups for terror organizations.'' `` They are not an innocent workers' union but front organizations behind which the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s political arm has been hiding for years,'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> also denounced an upcoming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> review of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s trade privileges because of alleged abuses of Palestinian workers' rights. The <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Palestinian lobby in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, has accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of closing down union offices indiscriminately, arresting <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> labor activists and denying trade union protection to more than 100,000 Arabs in the territories who travel to jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Thursday he would review <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s duty-free trade status following the complaint, which was filed in June. A country found to have abused worker rights risks losing its privilege to export products to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> free of duties under the Generalized System of Preferences. In 1987, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> exported $ 487 million in goods under the program. Responding to <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s statement, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said: `` We shall explain to our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> friends that when it comes to the lives of Jews, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not be pressured by economic sanctions.'' An Arab hospital official said nine-year-old <PERSON> Marah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadadeli </PERSON> was shot in the left leg when she ran out of her house in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the largest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the girl thought she heard the army announce on loudspeakers that a curfew was over. The announcement actually said the curfew was continuing. The 120,000 residents of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> have been confined to their homes since Thursday. A 23-year-old <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> man was also shot in the left leg by soldiers, a hospital official said, adding that he did not know the circumstances. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, residents of the Jabaliya refugee camp attacked a Palestinian fireman who worked for the military administration and his family defended him with knives and chains, the army said. It said two of the Arab attackers were treated for slight injuries and arrested. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> Thursday, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> also suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opened fire on <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths who refused to let him through a barricade, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. The man was believed to be a collaborator because only Arabs who work with the authorities are granted permission to carry a weapon, the news reports said. <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabali </PERSON>, 14, who was shot in the shoulder, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from his hospital bed that the man `` got out of his car, pulled a pistol and shot me.'' The clashes followed three attacks on suspected collaborators over the past three days. In the worst incident, masked men broke into the home of <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazaza </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yatta </LOCATION> Wednesday and hacked him to death with axes. In another development, the Nazareth-based Arab weekly <PERSON> A-Sinara </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was considering forming a provisional government next month composed of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> academics from the occupied territories, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The newspaper said formation of the government-in-exile would be announced either at next month's <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> session in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or when <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> addresses the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 13. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Friday asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to stop deporting <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and said it was was worried by growing violence in the occupied territories. Since the start of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 33 Palestinians and ordered another 25 expelled from the occupied lands. The Israelis say those deported helped foment the unrest.

 A federal jury Friday acquitted 20 reputed mob figures of racketeering charges, ending what is believed to be the nation's longest federal criminal trial and handing the government a stunning defeat. The jury, which had been selected 21 months ago, read 77 separate innocent verdicts before the courtroom erupted in pandemonium. The defendants and their attorneys hugged and gave a standing ovation to the jury, which had deliberated just 14 hours. The jury forewoman wept. `` What's there to say,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON> said. `` Apparently the jury just resented the length -LRB- of the trial -RRB- and the breadth of the indictment.'' The government had charged that <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Tumac'' Accetturo of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and his co-defendants controlled a powerful <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> faction of the Lucchese organized crime family that had illegal gambling, loan-sharking, drug-dealing and fraudulent credit card operations. The defense tried to discredit government witnesses, many of whom had serious criminal records. The government contended that only such insiders could tell the story of the organized crime family. Defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhnke </PERSON> said the verdict was a `` complete rejection'' of long government racketeering prosecutions against numerous defendants. `` We think this is certainly the last prosecution that can be brought like this,'' added defense attorney <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>. `` My client is enormously thrilled by the result,'' said <PERSON> Accetturo </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Skoller </PERSON>. `` I'm just glad it was everybody -LRB- acquitted -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Taccetta </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> resident charged with supervising the organization in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The defendants and their lawyers waited outside the courthouse to applaud the jurors as they emerged before going to a restaurant to celebrate. Some of the jurors blew kisses, waved and smiled broadly. `` They should never, ever do anything like this to anybody again,'' said juror <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannigan </PERSON>. `` It's really unfair, not only to defendants but to jurors.'' The jurors went through each charge against each defendant and reached a conclusion so quickly because they had a `` good system.'' Another juror, hospital maintenance worker <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, reached at his home in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, said, `` I just want to enjoy my family and get back to my lifestyle. `` I do n't want to be bothered. Do n't call me any more,'' he added, before hanging up the phone. Before they were dismissed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> thanked the jury, saying, `` I commend you in the highest terms for your dedication, your patience, your attentiveness.'' `` I'm just glad it's over,'' the judge said later, adding he planned to go on vacation as soon as possible. The panel began deliberating Thursday morning with a record to consider that included 40,000 pages of transcripts, testimony from 89 witnesses and 850 exhibits, including 400 tapes. The government's star witness was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Alonzo </PERSON>, a diagnosed schizophrenic, admitted drug addict and alcoholic and convicted criminal who had shot one of the defendants _ his cousin _ five times. Defense attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, elected mayor of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> during the trial, criticized the government for calling `` liars, thieves, crooks and criminals'' as witnesses. `` American jurors realize that's not enough under our Constitution,'' he said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Critchley </PERSON>, who represented <LOCATION> Taccetta </LOCATION>, called the verdict a `` collective victory.'' `` The odds in this one were against 1,000 to 1,'' he said. The government had alleged the defendants, charged in an indictment unsealed in March 1986, operated out of the <LOCATION> Hole-in-the-Wall </LOCATION> luncheonette in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, where pictures of gangsters <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON> hang on the wall. Witnesses testified about kisses of respect for the boss, `` tribute'' payments and mob `` sit-downs.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who came to office after the indictment was unsealed in August 1985, said he had no regrets about the prosecution but in the future would try to keep cases `` as short and simple as possible.'' `` Despite this loss, the days of the Mafia are numbered,'' said <PERSON> Alito </PERSON>. According to the Administrative Office of the Courts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the trial surpassed in length the `` Pizza Connection'' heroin smuggling case, which ended after 17 months in March 1987.

 Many in this blue-collar town remember <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> only distantly, a 1960s classmate who was shy, with a sly smile, and in recent years was generous with his family. Now authorities in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> say the former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant may have headed an international spy ring that sold <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense secrets to the Soviets at high prices for 10 years. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 41, enlisted in the Army on Aug. 9, 1965, soon after he graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Sebring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Acquaintances said he seldom returned to his hometown of 5,000 people, about 55 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, although he came back in 1985 for a 20-year class reunion. `` He had flown home from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. It was in August, and he told us that in a month or two he would retire,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Igro </PERSON>, who was on the school's track team with him. `` It was about 20 years since anyone had seen him, since he joined the service right out of high school. There was just small talk, about old days in school, not about what he was doing now.'' The <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> family lived in two houses on <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, neighbors say. The first house, where <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> grew up, caught fire a short time after the family moved across the street. `` Clyde sent cash _ money _ to his mother to buy a house about five years ago,'' said <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, 22, a neighbor before the Conrads moved from here several years ago. `` What we heard was that every time he would move -LRB- in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-, he would buy a new house.'' The Conrads still own their former home on the street, and a tenant is trying to buy it, neighbors said. Neighbors said they were not sure where the <PERSON> Conrads </PERSON> now live, although his father and a sister lives in <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION>, about six miles west of here. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, said Friday he had not seen his son in nine years. Other relatives were not immediately available for comment. His sister, <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> <PERSON> Henschen </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> that family members have not spoken with <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> since his arrest. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> was arrested Tuesday and was being held in a West German prison pending further investigation. He was charged with `` compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especially grave case,'' according to the prosecutor's office. West German authorities have said millions of dollars may have been involved. At the Tin Lantern restaurant in downtown Sebring, owner <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohde </PERSON> made light of the allegations. `` You want our spy sandwich?'' <PERSON> Rohde </PERSON> asked patrons. `` It comes with a secret decoder ring.'' But <PERSON> Rohde </PERSON> admitted the news seemed to have taken residents aback. `` They're just shocked. Nobody expected it,'' said <PERSON> Rohde </PERSON>, 50. `` They live in this town for years, and they suddenly have a spy scandal and they say, ` My God, how could it be someone from here?''' One McKinley Street resident, who would give her name only as Mrs. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, said she remembered <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> as a youngster but learned little about him or his family despite living on the same street for more than 30 years. `` We'd talk every now and then, just occasionally,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said of the family. `` But people around here pretty much mind their own business. I knew them, but their business was their business and I did n't get into it.'' `` The family was real well-liked,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 33, who lived three houses from the Conrads. `` I did n't know <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, the one that was in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, but I ran with his sister. `` They just minded their own business and never got into no arguments or nothing.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, 65, said he used to go to the racetrack with <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON>. `` We used to go to the track quite often,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. `` We'd bet a couple of dollars on each race, a little here, a little there Sometimes we'd win _ most of the time, we'd win _ but sometimes we'd lose.'' Of the allegations against <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said: `` I do n't believe he done it. I do n't know for sure, but I knew his daddy, and I just do n't believe it.''

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury began deliberating Friday whether the Copper-7 intrauterine device caused sterility in a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> woman. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, 30, and her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, are seeking at least $ 16.5 million from <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer of the birth-control device. The damages sought are more than any jury has awarded in 18 similar cases. The jury, which has heard three months of testimony, began deliberations Friday morning and was sent home about 5 p.m. Jurors were instructed to return Monday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Kociembas </PERSON>' attorney, argued during trial that the Copper-7 caused pelvic inflammatory disease and rendered Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> sterile. He said the Chicago-based <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> was negligent in designing the device with a tailstring that he said provided a haven for bacteria. The Copper-7 was rushed to market without proper testing and sold to women without adequate warning that it could cause public inflammatory disease, and without warning that it was too large for women who had never given birth, <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Strain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, said the company exceeded <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requirements in marketing Copper-7, which was once the most widely used IUD in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He attacked the credibility of witnesses called by <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> and said <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> did not even prove that Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> suffered from pelvic infection, let alone that it was caused by the Copper-7. <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON> asked the jury for $ 15 million in punitive damages, $ 1.5 million to $ 2 million in compensatory damages for Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> and $ 300,000 in compensatory damages for her husband. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved the Copper-7 in 1974, and <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> sold between 300,000 and 400,000 of the IUDs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before withdrawing the product in the wake of numerous lawsuits. <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> law firm represents more than 150 of the 500 Copper-7 users who have sued <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>'s case is the first it has tried.

 Strikes and violence spread in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> quoted reliable sources as saying that up to 1,000 inmates were killed when guards opened fire at Insein Jail outside <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Friday. State-run <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio reported earlier that 2,000 inmates rebelled at Insein jail on Thursday, setting buildings ablaze. It said guards opened fire and `` some inmates and prison guards were injured.'' There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy between the Thursday date given by <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio and the Friday time given by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. TV broadcast Friday night Huge anti-government rallies continued in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> Friday, and retired ranking military officers joined those demanding immediate democracy in the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said: `` Anti-government demonstrations are reported to have begun.. -LRB- at Insein Jail -RRB- early in the day when prisoners had left their cells for breakfast. Several who tried to give speeches are said to have been shot dead and in the chaos that followed fires were started. `` As inmates fled to escape the flames, it is reported that security guards opened fire. According to reliable sources, about 1,000 people were killed. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio in its account said guards fired on prisoners as they tried to open the gates to escape from the burning building, but it speaks only of several people being wounded.'' The report was by <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunness </PERSON>, who had been in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and filed it from <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> it was not sure when <PERSON> Gunness </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oo </PERSON>, a former defense minister, said earlier in a letter to President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> that `` thousands of lives have been lost'' since the coup that began authoritarian military rule 26 years ago `` and the country is in the grip of a general strike paralyzing the whole administration.'' `` It is now long overdue to abolish one-party -LRB- government -RRB- in favor of a multiparty system,'' he wrote. `` It is imperative to immediately transfer power to an interim government ... composed of people acceptable to the country.'' A copy of the letter, dated Friday, was seen by the AP. Another letter urged <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the first civilian president since the coup, to form an interim government and release political prisoners. It was dated Tuesday and signed by a retired brigadier and 14 colonels. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio reported two other prison riots besides that at Insein: _ Prisoners set fires at <LOCATION> Bassein </LOCATION>, 90 miles west of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, on Wednesday, guards shot one inmate dead and about 100 prisoners escaped _ At <LOCATION> Akyab </LOCATION> jail in <LOCATION> Arrakan </LOCATION> state bordering <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, `` prisoners and people outside of the prison shouted slogans, demonstrated and started to riot'' Thursday night Six inmates were killed, 24 were wounded and about 1,600 escaped. According to the radio, all the prisoners were convicted of crimes unrelated to the anti-government protest. It said all the 2,750 people arrested this month during demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> had been released, except for those accused of serious crimes. The radio said protesters commandeered 27 buses Friday in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, stole gasoline under threat of violence and drove the buses around the city. An earlier broadcast said `` some violent incidents, looting and destructive acts have been reported in several townships since martial law was revoked in the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> city development areas'' Wednesday, and `` hooligans'' set shanties afire in some parts of the capital. No details were given. Officials said strikes halted trains and domestic flights of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> on Friday; closed oil refineries at <LOCATION> Syriam </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and at <LOCATION> Mann </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>; crippled most factories of the <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and stranded foreign ships in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> port. Most government offices in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> were empty. Friday was the second day without newspapers because workers at the six state-run dailies stayed home. People are hoarding necessities and the price of rice has soared. The largest and most widespread protests since the military takeover of 1962 have had the government on the defensive for a month. At least 112 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> alone, by official count, and unofficial reports put the toll much higher. Turmoil began when 77-year-old Ne Win, who led the coup and imposed rigid socialist rule, resigned late in July and the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chose <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> to succeed him. Demonstrations began almost immediately against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who was blamed for the ruthless crushing of dissent, and turned bloody Aug. 8 when security forces began shooting into crowds. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned after 17 days and <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the attorney general and one of two civilians in the Cabinet, replaced him Aug. 19. Student-led rallies continued and protesters demanded full democracy. Even <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s recommendation Wednesday that a special party congress be held Sept. 12 to consider a referendum on one-party rule did not end mass actions in the streets. Rallies have been peaceful since <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> quit, but the situation has deteriorated since <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> lifted martial law Wednesday and security personnel virtually disappeared from the streets. Police and government workers in <LOCATION> Taunggyi </LOCATION> joined 100,000 demonstrators Friday in demanding an interim government. Witnesses said it was the largest rally ever in the Shan state capital, 290 miles northeast of the capital. In <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, daughter of late independence leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, told 400,000 cheering people only immediate democracy could end the unrest. She asked the military to be `` the people's army'' and look after their interests.

 A tremor shook northern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> Friday, but no damage or injuries were reported, authorities said. The Seismological Intitute of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chile </ORGANIZATION> said the tremor measured three on Mercalli scale and was centered 190 miles north of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, near the coastal city of La <PERSON> Serena </PERSON>. Police reported no damage or injuries. The Mercalli scale gauges the intensity of an earthquake as felt in a specific location. The scale runs from 1 to 12: a 1 reading is not felt except by very few, favorably situated. A 12 reading is total damage.

 Premier <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> will meet Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> on Sunday, apparently to discuss a plan to raze villages in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, official media said Friday. The terse report over Hungarian radio did not contain details, but it was clear that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s plan to destroy 7,000 of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s 13,000 villages will be the main topic of their discussions in <LOCATION> Arad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Hungarians have complained that the move will wipe out hundreds of ethnic Hungarian communities. The two leaders will hold `` a working meeting ... on the basis of a mutual agreement,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said the Romanian president proposed the meeting through diplomatic channels on Thursday. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> is about 25 miles from the Hungarian border. The proposal was accepted in a hurriedly convened special session of the Hungarian party's Politburo Friday, <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said. The visit appears to have been arranged following a Hungarian initiative to defuse a deepening crisis between the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies over the plan to raze the villages and resettle the tens of thousands of residents. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has long accused the Romanian government of discrimination against the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians who live in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, most of them in <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>. Last weekend, Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> denounced the resettlement plan as `` a crime against mankind.'' The meeting will be the first encounter between the two countries' leaders in 11 years. In retaliation for an anti-Romanian demonstration in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> of about 50,000 people in June, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> ordered the closure of a Hungarian consulate in <LOCATION> Cluj-Napoca </LOCATION> and of a Hungarian culture institute in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> that never started operation. Romanian refugees and independent Hungarian groups Monday night started a two-week demonstration against the plan opposite the Romanian Embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>.

 Former Black Panther leader <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, who had refused parole from prison until a fellow inmate and ex-Panther also was released, decided to leave after all, prison officials said Friday. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> for two months for parole violations, refused to leave on his scheduled release date Tuesday, demanding that convicted murderer <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> `` Geronimo'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> also be freed. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> apparently changed his mind about staying behind bars when prison officials served him with extra conditions of parole, including a clause that should he again decline to leave, it would be considered a parole violation, said prison spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballatore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s refusal to leave so far has merely been a violation of prison rules, she said. The new clause would make it a parole violation, a much more serious offense. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was processed Friday, she said. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> is serving a life term for the 1968 slaying of a <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> woman during a $ 30 robbery. He entered prison in 1972 and lost his eighth bid parole two weeks ago for parole when a state panel called him a `` danger to the public.'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s supporters contend he was framed, that he's a political prisoner and the victim of police efforts to jail Panther leaders and dismantle the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the late 1960s and early'70s. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, 45, co-founder of the defunct <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> and its defense minister, has had two decades of scuffles with the law.

<TEXT>
 A decree made public Friday gives broad powers to paramilitary police accused by political activists of unprecedented brutality in breaking up demonstrations. The decree says the special police, attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, will be responsible for keeping public order at demonstrations, which have become more frequent under Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness. It gives them the power to enter homes and businesses in pursuit of suspects, seize autos and communications equipment and use a wide range of weapons. Crowd control previously was the responsibility of regular police, who also are governed by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The paramilitary police until now had been assigned only to guarding prisons and labor camps, and protecting government property and special shipments. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet approved the decree July 28, and it was published in a legislative digest that reached subscribers Friday. Soviet media have not reported the measure, signed by President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, but carried extensive dispatches on a decree of the same day that requires advance permission for public demonstrations and meetings and sets stiff fines and jail terms for violators. Political activists say the paramilitary police turned up at a demonstration Sunday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and during this year's unrest in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` In peacetime, the army is taking on extraordinary powers,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a leader of an unofficial opposition political group called the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` What is happening here is what happens in other countries only under martial law.'' <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said the new measure gives paramilitary police _ not regular police _ jurisdiction for the first time over political meetings and demonstrations. Dissident journalist <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON> said unprovoked beatings at Sunday's protest were unprecedented in recent times. On Sunday, the paramilitary police helped regular police stop a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> protest in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Pushkin Square against the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 20 years ago. They wore khaki uniforms without insignias, black boots and berets with <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> markings. More than 100 protesters were arrested and dissidents said the paramilitaries beat and kicked about 30 of them. <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said some members of the force told those arrested they had served in the Soviet army in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Paramilitary police units were reported in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> as early as February, months before the decree. They helped quell demonstrations by Armenians demanding the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian region attached to the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Under the decree, paramilitary police need not obtain a search warrant from a prosecutor, as regular police are required to do. <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said this violates a constitutional provision of inviolability of the home. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a special <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference June 28 there should be `` strict observance of the rights of citizens to the inviolability of their private life, home, the secrecy of telephone communication, postal and telegraph correspondence.'' On Friday, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ... called for creation of a state based on laws, but even in the times of -LRB- Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> there were n't laws that openly violated the constitution, such as this one does regarding inviolability.'' The decree says the paramilitary police will be used to stop violations of public order that have a `` mass character,'' threaten people's lives and health, disrupt businesses and damage property.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Residents of two towns on the edge of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> were warned Friday they might have to evacuate because of a 36,000-acre forest fire, and inside the park rangers shepherded convoys of tourists down roads otherwise closed by fires. Forest fires also threatened two communities in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, where youngsters at one Bible camp were sent home as a precaution. Numerous fires also charred woodlands in parts of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, where one fast-moving fire forced firefighters to pull back Friday. Two additional battalions of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops, about 1,200 soldiers, from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, were being trained to assist hard-pressed civilian crews, according to officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates firefighting efforts in the West. About 1,200 men from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> already are fighting fires in and near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Friday's two convoys of up to 350 cars allowed tourists to get from one side of the park to the other in safety, after a ranger drove the route between the park communities of Canyon and <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> to check its condition. <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said notices were posted Thursday night notifying visitors of the convoys. `` They think it's a big adventure. Of course, some of the people are upset,'' she said. The convoys filed past the 114,000-acre `` North Fork'' fire, one of 10 involving about 400,000 acres of the park. Just outside the park's northeast entrance, a 36,000-acre blaze in the Absaroka-Beartooth wilderness area in south-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> threatened two towns Friday and a fire official said evacuation plans were ready. `` We have about a 30 to 40 percent chance that we would have to evacuate'' <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and Silver Gate, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON>, incident commander on the Storm Creek fire. The southern edge of the fire was about four miles north of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and a rocky ridge with little vegetation stood between the fire and the town, <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON> said. `` But today we have a forecast of high northerly winds and we could have wind-carried embers that would carry as far as one mile out in front of the fire,'' he said. He estimated that perhaps 500 to 1,000 people might be affected if an evacuation is ordered. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> stopped charging its $ 10 entry fee Wednesday because of the inconvenience fires created for visitors. But some visitors saw the restricted access in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> as a blessing. `` I kind of enjoy being alone in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> at the height of the tourist season,'' said <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Simcoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` This is nice, actually, and they say we're here at a very historical moment in the park's history.'' Park facilities at <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, Canyon, <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> remained closed Friday. The park's west entrance was re-opened Friday morning, although intermittent closures were expected. The only other major roads open in the park included the one from the park's north entrance to Mammoth and Tower; from the northeast entrance at <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to Tower and Mammoth; from Mammoth to Indian <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>; and from the west entrance to Old Faithful, also subject to intermittent closures. The park's south entrance near <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> also remained closed. On Friday afternoon, park officials began discouraging people from leaving through the park's northeast entrance because the road east of <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was closed in case residents of that town have to evacuate. From the south entrance, the Rockefeller Memorial Parkway leading into Grand Teton National Park also was closed, because of a 21,500-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Some 1,525 firefighters, including about 600 soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, battled the 162,700-acre Clover-Mist fire burning in the park and in steep, rugged terrain in the <ORGANIZATION> Shoshone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Elsewhere, residents of <LOCATION> Maxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, a town of about two dozen households 90 miles southwest of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, were told to stand by Friday for possible evacuation as a fire spread to about 7,500 acres of heavy timber overnight, said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, a fire information officer. Winds pushed the fire away from the town during the day, though, he said. The fire forced closure of the main road through the area, destroyed a trailer home and two bulldozers and chased fire crews out of a mining camp in the <ORGANIZATION> Deerlodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. In southwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the lightning-sparked <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> fire crept within a half mile of a subdivision of about 1,000 people north of <LOCATION> Grants </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION>. In the northeastern corner of the state, the Ward Canyon fire spread to within a mile of the tiny community of Troy, authorities said. Both communities were placed on evacuation alert. The Ward Canyon blaze had burned 15 unoccupied structures, mostly hunting cabins. About 120 second-grade children from the Fir Point Bible Camp were taken to a school about 25 miles north of Grants Pass `` as a precautionary move'' after the <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire grew to 500 acres, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He said the children headed home Friday and the fire was 75 percent contained. Also in the state's northeast corner, the Tepee Butte fire exploded to 18,000 acres of grass and timber by Friday morning from 150 acres Thursday afternoon, and firefighters said it could spread to as many as 80,000 acres. In western <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, swirling winds and dry conditions forced fire bosses to withdraw hundreds of firefighters from the raging Eagle Bar fire near <LOCATION> Hells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, which spread to over 3,000 acres along the <LOCATION> Idaho-Oregon </LOCATION> border. Thirty firefighters were trapped for an hour in a hotspot and had to use their fire shelters for safety before being airlifted out by helicopter at dawn.

 Share prices recovered moderately in thin trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Saturday following a major decline the previous day. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues won back 113.50 points, or 0.41 percent, to close Saturday's half-day session at 27,678.91 points. The index plummeted 305.03 points Friday after European countries raised their key lending rates, depressing stock markets around the world. Volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most major shares are listed, was a light 230 million shares. `` The gain in the Nikkei index is largely caused by the rebound of major shares such as steel and electronics,'' said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But the market as a whole does n't look too good.

The frail man of 80 said he spent 14 years in a labor camp after being arrested in 1929 on trumped-up charges, and hoped he would live to see the building completed. `` We are n't doing it for us, but for the future generation,'' to prevent a repetition of the terror, the balding <PERSON> Kotlyar </PERSON> said, his body shaking, his voice trembling. <PERSON> Kotlyar </PERSON> stood with a cane at a microphone Thursday night in a packed auditorium.

 Authorities on Thursday released <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s top dissident and nearly 1,700 anti-government protesters, and hundreds of thousands more rallied to demand immediate democracy, rejecting the president's proposal to consider multiparty rule Dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> left Insein Jail, quickly organized a rally of about 200,000 people, and demanded an interim government be formed to lead the nation to democracy. On Wednesday, President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> bowed to three days of mass protests against one-party rule and called for a referendum on multiparty democracy. The leader _ the nation's third in five weeks _ lifted martial law imposed Aug. 3 in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, withdrew troops from the city center and lifted curfews throughout the country. But to the people in the streets Thursday, the moves clearly were insufficient.

 Government figures showed Thursday that the economy, surging through a stiff drag caused by the drought, grew at the surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.3 percent in the second quarter but inflation hit a six-year peak of 5.1 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the gain in the gross national product, the total output of goods and services, would have soared beyond the 3.3 percent clip had it not been for a larger-than-expected $ 9.5 billion loss in farm production. Without that impact of the drought, GNP growth from April through June would have hit a 4.3 percent annual pace, it said. The 5.1 percent inflation rate, compared with just 1.7 percent in the first quarter, sparked new worries that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to step up its anti-inflation campaign by sending interest rates even higher to quell the heatup.

<HEAD>Study of Ethics Enjoying Resurgence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A year after a leaking gasoline line caused his car to explode, 25-year-old <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> remained so severely burned that he would die without long and painful treatment. <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> asked to be allowed to die. Question: Should the hospital grant his request? The increasing frequency of questions like this has led to a national resurgence in the study of ethics, according to <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for the Advancement of Applied Ethics, which opened in June. Ethicists say the number of such centers has been increasing in the last decade, especially at medical schools. `` If your medical school or center does n't have a serious program to address the ethical as well as the scientific, you are kind of behind the times,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, associate for policy studies at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hastings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, perhaps the oldest ethics research institute, founded in 1969. `` I would say there has been a change in attitudes since the 1950s and 1960s when philosophers felt the study of ethics was not very interesting,'' he said. `` Now it's one of the most vital areas in academic philosophy.'' <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> decided to open an ethics center because, like many other universities, `` we felt that a new priority should be given to ethics and values,'' <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said. `` Instead of just caring about them, we should start doing something about them.'' The university expects its center will help students and professionals deal with a wide range of ethical issues, including insider trading, influence peddling, managing AIDS in the workplace, sexual harassment, South African divestment, whistleblowing, fetal tissue research, abortion, organ transplants and affirmative action, <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said. A Carnegie Mellon videodisc telling the story of <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON>'s 1973 accident and subsequent medical care, called `` The Right to Die,'' is used to guide businessmen, government officials and health care professionals through the complexities of moral questions that did n't exist 20 years ago, <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said. At certain points in the story, the videodisc is stopped to allow seminar participants to debate the ethical issues and make their own decisions about what should have been done. <PERSON> Cowart </PERSON> was not allowed to die, and today he is remarried and a practicing attorney in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of Ethics at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lists 56 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ethics centers or programs in its <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bioethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, many of them formed in the last few years. Spectacular science fiction-like news stories about new medical techniques and capabilities have helped glamorize ethics, said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonsen </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>'s new department of Medical History and Ethics. `` The first heart transplant was done in the late 1960s and that captured the attention of everyone,'' <PERSON> Jonsen </PERSON> said. `` Every one was asking, ` Is that right? Taking the heart out of one person and putting it in another?' The media played that up in a big way and got a big response.'' The reaction also enlivened debate among philosophers, scientists and doctors, he said. `` The reactions to that within medicine was to say, ` This is fantastic technology _ what's its best use? It may have adverse consequences,''' <PERSON> Jonsen </PERSON> said. `` In medicine you're supposed to benefit your patients. That's the first rule The ethical question we are asking is can this.. benefit my patient?'' The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> Ethics, which opened in February 1987, was formed after administrators and faculty began reflecting on medical cases that grabbed the public's attention, said center director <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisel </PERSON> `` One day in 1984, I picked up the paper and found a front-page story on <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, the little girl who received a baboon's heart at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. I reflected about that every day for a week, and I thought of similar stories,'' <PERSON> Meisel </PERSON> said. `` Finally, we said that this is an important topic and we should do something about it.'' Kidney dialysis and organ transplantation sparked ethical debates in the 1970s, said <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, director for the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s biomedical ethics center. `` Today the new developments are in genetics and reproduction,'' he said. `` Also, with the emphasis on the civil rights movement and the women's movement, more patients have been demanding more information from doctors about themselves, about their conditions, and there has been more emphasis on the patient's right to determine what treatment he or she should have.'' The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>'s year-old Center for Biomedical Ethics also was formed after medical school administrators, students and doctors agreed more attention should be paid to ethics, said center director <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>. `` You need new ethical norms at a time of rapid change,'' <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> said. Although only a few weeks old, the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> center already has been busy conducting seminars for the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and a number of other groups and agencies. Advances in medical technology have led to perhaps the most uncomfortable, most highly publicized ethical questions, but difficult issues also arise in other areas, ethicists say. `` Suppose you sat down and thought about rearranging your investment portfolio to avoid businesses and investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said. `` Could you come out just as well? And if you could and it does n't cost you anything, would n't that be a good thing to do? ... `` For a variety of reasons, the business world is becoming more alert to ethical issues _ either to keep out of trouble or make their operations run more smoothly or because they simply want to be more responsible ethically to their employees and to society,'' <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said. Like other ethics centers, the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> center does not advocate particular moral values, however. `` The idea is not to sell ethics consulting, but to help people come to grips with ethical issues on their own,'' <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> said.

 Sometimes, one can get sick of all that culture during a European vacation. That, anyway, is how it appears to Dr. <PERSON> Graziella </PERSON> <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON>, the head of psychiatry at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>. In the past 10 years she has treated more than 115 tourists for what she calls `` <ORGANIZATION> Stendhal </ORGANIZATION>'s Syndrome'' _ an emotional reaction to hundreds of years of history and art, all hitting the traveler at once. `` The historical memory in these cities of art stirs the emotions,'' she says. `` They can be emotions of great pleasure but also of great pain.'' With its vast pink-and-green Duomo cathedral, its museums filled with Renaissance art and its dark cobbled streets, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> is a throwback to another century _ except, of course, for the hordes of backpackers and signs reading in English, `` We make real Italian ice cream.'' <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON> maintains that the overwhelming sense of the past sometimes disorients tourists and leads to panic attacks, intense feelings of persecution and abandonment and a loss of a sense of reality and identity. `` Very often, there's the anguish of death,'' she says, prompted by the vivid sense of historical figures that reminds visitors of their own mortality. <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON>'s work has aroused considerable interest, not to mention debate, in the hometown of <LOCATION> Michelangelo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Botticelli </PERSON> and Donatello. `` It sounds simply ridiculous,'' declares <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> <PERSON> Padova </PERSON>, assistant director of the Palatine Gallery. <PERSON> Patrizio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostecresi </PERSON>, administrator of the Duomo, says he's seen no unusual effect inspired by the church. `` People have committed suicide here,'' he says, knitting his brow. `` But I do n't think it's the art.'' Nonetheless, the local government is interested in the research. The city of 425,000 receives 5 million tourists a year who spend upwards of $ 670 million. The province of <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> last year gave <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON> and several researchers a grant to expand their study. They are now trying to get data from <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to see if the phenomenon exists there. <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON> says she first noticed something wrong a decade ago, as more and more tourists visiting the works of art arrived at the hospital filled with anguish. A thing of beauty, it seemed, was not always a joy to behold. Most people suffered psychological problems, but some also complained of heart palpitations or dizziness. She perceived two categories of sufferers: solitary travelers, often Europeans of a sentimental bent; and members of organized tours who apparently have difficulty adjusting to new things. Many of the latter group, she says, are Americans from small towns and `` with a cultural level that is not very sophisticated.'' The team has studied the cases of 115 people who were hospitalized, but many other people were treated and released, <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON> says. The researchers decided to name the problem after <PERSON> Stendhal </PERSON>, the French novelist who lived in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the early 19th century and wrote of being overwhelmed emotionally by the beauty and the past in <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>. Modern Stendhals have reached crisis points before <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>'s statue of <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caravaggio </PERSON>'s painting of <LOCATION> Bacchus </LOCATION>, and under the concentric circles in the Duomo cupola, <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON> says. However, it's not like tourists are disturbed by a Donatello or terrified by a Titian. `` It's everything put together,'' she says. <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON> admits that the some of the symptoms may stem from travel weariness and stress. However, she says, `` most people have spoken of how they felt in this city, their rapport with this city.'' Dr. <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pancheri </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> at the University of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said people can be moved by historic cities but `` it does n't seem likely it would be a syndrome.'' <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON> <PERSON> Carriglia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>'s tourism director, suggests that the problem is really the crowds and the quick pace of modern travel. `` It is n't the monuments and the art that make people feel sick,'' he insists. <PERSON> Magherini </PERSON> advises her patients to rest and be with people of their own culture. In some cases, she prescribes tranquilizers. `` Italian cities of art are outside the reality of American life,'' notes the Duomo's Ostecresi. `` Here a normal building is 300 or 400 years old. People sometimes feel like they're in a film.'' Visitors need to take more time, he says, adding: `` Even <PERSON> Stendhal </PERSON> tried to see too much.''

<HEAD>Tennessee Williams Comes To Life At Edinburgh Festival</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tennessee Williams, the tortured and talented Pulitzer Prize winner, is being reborn at the <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in a one-man show that pays homage to one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest playwrights `` I like to think of it as a tribute to the man,'' actor <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> said of `` Confessions of a Nightingale,'' his solo show about the late author of `` The Glass Menagerie'' and `` A Streetcar Named Desire.'' The 90-minute play, adapted by <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>'s book, `` The Ultimate Seduction,'' had its European debut on Aug. 24 at <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>'s St. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON>'s Hall. It is the only American theatrical offering among this year's official line-up at the Scottish capital's 42nd annual arts binge. The 54-year-old <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> introduced the show in January 1985 at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Playhouse </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The tanned, silver-haired actor has taken it on regular tours ever since, stopping at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Theater </PERSON> for a brief run in the fall of 1986. `` It's been a wonderful high,'' <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> said in an interview prior to the first of five <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> performances. He said that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who died in 1984 one month before his 73rd birthday, had been an important influence in his life, figuring in `` the beginnings, the so-called end and then the restart -LRB- of my career -RRB-.'' In 1953, newly arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from his home in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> used a <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> one-act play to audition for drama school. The first Broadway play he ever saw was `` The Glass Menagerie,'' and the fledgling actor even found himself acting opposite the playwright at a party in the mid-1950s. `` I always said <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was my first leading lady,'' chuckled <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON>. The reading, from the Hungarian play `` <PERSON> Fata </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgana </PERSON>,'' cast <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as an older woman in love with the young man played by <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON>. In 1972, <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> decided to give up acting to join a public relations firm in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and he made what he thought would be his farewell stage appearance playing Lord <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> production of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION>' `` Camino Real.'' Then, in 1983, he returned to the stage in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> production of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' `` <PERSON> Vieux </PERSON> <PERSON> Carre </PERSON>,'' and the chance to embody the playwright soon followed. `` I started it in a small way, never dreaming it would have a life,'' he said of `` Confessions,'' which began as a short piece to accompany the unveiling of a bust of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Playhouse </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> was wary at first of continuing the impersonation: `` I was very hesitant; I had always avoided one-person shows.'' But he soon found the rewards irresistible. `` It opened up a whole new career for me because I had been a juvenile actor when I quit,'' he said. `` When I was 35, I was still getting occasional calls to play teen-agers. Doris Day had nothing on me.'' <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> empathized with <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' own concerns about depression, aging and the vicissitudes of life in the theater. `` I certainly felt I could identify from the point of view of a career that had started off well as a young actor and then the years when it was n't working and I had to get out of the business,'' he said. <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> is working again, with seasons on TV's `` The Colbys'' and `` Dynasty'' behind him and a stint on the CBS series, `` Wise Guy.'' Following <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON> takes `` Confessions'' to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and then is hoping for a run in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The experience, he said, has been cathartic in a way <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> might have understood. `` <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> had a wonderful line: ` If I get rid of my demons I lose my angels,''' said <PERSON> Stricklyn </PERSON>. `` I'm trying to do everything in reverse: to get rid of my demons and gain my angels.''

<TEXT>
 OK, so you've managed to stay awake all the way through `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>.'' Now it's time to hit the hay, right? Wrong. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is torturing sleepyheads sans VCRs by tacking on a new half hour after <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> that's gon na be hard to turn off _ `` Later with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Costas </PERSON>.'' Yeah, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> is that sports guy, the one who does baseball for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. But this is not a sports show, and <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> has quickly proven himself a facile interviewer with an intelligent, easygoing style that fits just about any kind of guest. For his premiere week last week, he had a candid, two-part interview with newswoman-author <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON>, handled delicate questioning of former child superstar <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> and traded bits with comedian <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON>. Part 2 of the Crystal interview airs tonight. The first show with <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> was extremely serious. Outspoken as she is, <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> seemed even more open than usual when she talked about her late colleague <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Savitch </PERSON>, the subject of a couple of recent tell-all books that raise questions about the way <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> handled the troubled star. <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> told Costas of her one-time jealousy toward the beautiful blond anchorwoman, then her eventual realization that <PERSON> Savitch </PERSON> was a woman out of her league and painfully aware of it, gradually sinking into drug abuse. <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> said she and some <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> colleagues met over a weekend to plan some kind of psychological rescue mission, but it was too late. <PERSON> Savitch </PERSON> drowned when her car fell into a canal adjoining a restaurant parking lot; the accident was unrelated to drugs. Costas handles the subject sensitively. The next night with <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> was lighter as she offered up her irreverent assessment of network news, and the two ended up in a funny, casual discussion of the movie `` Broadcast News.'' Viewers might as well have been sitting around the kitchen table with them. With <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> had another serious story on his hands. The one-time toast of TV when he starred on `` Diff ` rent Strokes,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> is now a grown young man with serious health problems _ he needs a third kidney transplant _ and very little acting He is bitter toward his parents and management for not giving him more guidance as a child. <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> elicited the necessary information, but allowed the young actor to maintain his dignity throughout. Costas seemed overprepared for Crystal, occasionally asking questions that contained answers _ `` What's different about your -LRB- <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> -LRB- impression -RRB- compared to others who may have gotten the voice but not the character?'' or, about life on the road as a standup comic, `` Is it true you often ate dinner by the bathroom light in the motel?'' By tonight's show, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> hits his stride with Crystal. There's a very nice exchange when <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> recalls the genesis of perhaps his best comedy bit, his bittersweet impersonation of an old, black jazz musician _ `` Can you dig it I knew that you could.'' Crystal's father produced jazz shows and he remembers being around those guys when he was a child and being profoundly influenced by them. `` That's the reason I've always performed, was these guys,'' he tells <PERSON> Costas </PERSON>. `` Because no matter what was happening to them, when they got up and played, they felt good.'' <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> gets to combine his first love, baseball, in this interview when he and <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> discuss the brilliant, 8-minute film Crystal and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Guest </PERSON> made for `` Saturday Night Live,'' in which they played two retired <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> baseball players, Rooster and The King. <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> does n't miss a beat when <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> suggests being interviewed for a few minutes in character as Rooster. For the next two weeks, <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> continues his eclectic guest list with <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rona </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, `` Phantom of the Opera'' star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and `` Night Court'' star <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Larroquette </PERSON>. The show airs only Monday-Thursday, because, as <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> notes, `` nobody wants to tinker with that great <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> institution, ` Friday Night Videos,''' which incidentally also has <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebersol </PERSON> as its executive producer. <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> will not be relegated to only late-night all season. He's on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s team covering the prime-time Summer Olympics starting next month But insomniacs need n't worry. <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> has taped enough shows to cover him while he's in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Upcoming: Bigger Merit Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A big change could be coming in payroll merit increases as an intense period of corporate belt-tightening begins to relax. The possibility does n't represent any change of heart by those who control payrolls, but instead is simply the hardnosed recognition of an economic reality _ that there may not be much to be gained through further tightening. It is nothing new in American life. It has happened before and will happen again because it is a self-correcting cyclical phenomenon, as a bit of recent history illustrates. At the tail end of the 1970s, for example, major companies sought to improve their net income by cutting staffs, limiting pay raises and otherwise becoming leaner, meaner and more efficient. It was n't a choice easily arrived at, and in fact, it was long delayed. For nearly two decades American companies had been developing an enormous midriff of white-collar workers _ and becoming less competitive because of it. The problem was exacerbated by inflation, which rose to double-digit levels and effectively priced many American products out of the growing global marketplace. Change was imperative. Costs had to be cut. One company after another adopted the same policy: Pare staffs and restrain pay raises; get more net for the payroll dollar. Some companies went further and closed plants, but most just watched the payroll. Then, as the economy recovered from the big recession of the early 1980s, the pressure came off again. Growth was in again. In 1982, according to a compensation survey released this week, merit raises rose 9.1 percent. And then, once again, the lid came down. American companies, though more efficient now, continued to receive stiff competition from abroad. Payroll-watching was in again. Work forces shrank; salary increases dwindled. Since 1982, according to <ORGANIZATION> Sibson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a management consulting firm, salary increases have declined steadily. By 1988, merit increases averaged just 5.3 percent. And next year, says <PERSON> Sibson </PERSON>, the average will be 5.2 percent. But now, it states, the cutting may have reached its limit. The jobless rate is down to the mid-5 percent range, meaning most of those laid-off workers have found new jobs. Companies now are looking for workers. It could mean a big shift of emphasis by those who watch the bottom line. Instead of improving profits by squeezing payrolls, some companies now might have to seek results by rewarding good workers with bigger pay raises. The result, says <PERSON> Sibson </PERSON>, could be the end next year of seven years of steadily declining salary increases and downsizing of staffs. `` It appears companies may have achieved all they can in those areas,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sibson </ORGANIZATION> principal who managed the survey, the results of which are based on responses from 653 companies. Many companies are much leaner today than four years ago, said <PERSON> Michell </PERSON>, adding that the key issue now facing companies is how to retrain and motivate those employees who have remained with their organizations. He concludes that `` incentive programs which allow companies to share the risks and reward with their employees will take on a greater role as organizations address this issue.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said three-quarters of survey participants now have incentive compensation programs, and that many are planning to extend them. The reason, he says, is corporations recognize they need to pay more attention to motivating workers, to rewarding performance and to increasing productivity. And, as it was in the earlier part of the cycle, when downsizing and pay restraints were in vogue, the goal is the same: The bottom line.

<HEAD>Leslie Caron Revels in Gigi's Other Side</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 She was a waif-like but winsome coquette whose delicious romantic romps added a touch of whimsy to the 1950s and early'60s. Today, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caron </PERSON>, the `` Gigi'' of yesteryear, is a grandmother who's about to portray the matriarch of fashion <ORGANIZATION> Coco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> in a TV movie. She's also written a book of short stories called `` Vengeance,'' and a screenplay she describes as a `` parable of war.'' `` I suppose I have two sides to my nature,'' <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> said in an interview. `` But I'm not cute. Whatever I am, cute is not the word.'' <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> retains a place in film history, a time when the musical embodied the spirit and romance of an era. Beginning in 1951 with <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> in `` An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' through `` Daddy Longlegs'' with <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Astaire </PERSON> in 1955 to 1958's Academy Award-winning `` <PERSON> Gigi </PERSON>,'' she won the hearts of audiences around the world. But now, more than three decades later at the age of 57, she is remembered mainly as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s French gamine-in-residence. While still a teen-ager, <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> was plucked from a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> ballet by <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who took her to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> where she went under contract for MGM. `` I was stereotyped after ` An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,''' she said. `` And I think Americans a long, long time ago decided that I was cute, a gamine and all those things. Actually, I'm a very serious person.'' <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> credits much of her artistic bent to the legacy left by her American-born mother, a dancer whose own dreams went unfulfilled. `` My mother protected me and helped me fulfill my wishes. But I think they were the expression of her wishes.'' Her mother's suicide in 1967 stoked her determination and left `` a feeling of unfinished business.'' As she approached 40, she took up writing and refuge in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, her hometown. A word processer sits on a table in her living room. <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> had just returned from the printer with the script of the film she wrote and plans to direct. `` It's a moral tale. It's about the incapacity of people to get along. In other words, it's a parable of war on a family scale,'' she said. The screenplay, whose title she refuses to divulge, is to be a family affair. She hopes her children, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> and actress-daughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>, who has given her a grandchild, will participate in the project. Both are the children of her second marriage to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s National Theater. <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> has been married three times. She has written what she calls a `` good part'' for herself, meaning neither cute nor guileless. `` I might have been innocent and guileless when I was 18,'' she said. `` But, my God, the years have passed and I've lived quite a lot of drama. And the public keeps seeing the same films on the television.'' In 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Doubleday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> published a collection of her short stories, `` Vengeance.'' `` They are sort of brutal,'' she said. `` No, cruel is the better word. I do have a sharp eye and a wicked sense of humor.'' As a one-time star still at work, <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> is finally able to stretch herself as an actress in a variety of roles. `` For the last 10 years, the spectrum of parts I'm offered just swings widely,'' she said. Most recently, she portrays <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> in a syndicated TV miniseries for the fall season, `` The Man Who Lived at the Ritz.'' Based on the best-selling novel by A.E. <PERSON> Hotchner </PERSON>, it is the story of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> artist, played by <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, caught in wartime <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> between the Resistance and the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> played the submissive wife of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, portrayed by <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> in the movie, `` The Train,'' which recounted the exiled <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s journey home to start the Russian Revolution. She also appeared in an episode last year on TV's `` Falcon Crest.'' <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> thinks of herself as a survivor. `` I remember a rather cruel producer, cruel and rude, who said as she hired me that she so admired -LRB- <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bardot </PERSON> for retiring when she was losing her looks,'' <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> recalled. `` I think it's so against everything I believe because so long as there is life, there's a contribution you can make. ... I think one must not just be banking on one's looks.''

<HEAD>Irwin Winkler Is ``Hands-On'' Producer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Film producer <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> prefers being on the front line to thinking about the bottom line. `` For the good producer, raising capital is about the last thing to worry about,'' he said. `` If you're good, the money comes very easily. `` Everybody sees themselves through the golden light. I see myself as somebody involved from the very conception. Every film I do I'm involved with from the very conception of the project.'' <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> -LRB- `` Rocky,'' `` The Right Stuff,'' `` Raging Bull'' -RRB- sticks to that principle on his latest production, `` Betrayed.'' He developed the screenplay, helped with casting, was on the set during filming and worked on the post-production and promotion. `` Betrayed'' was directed by <PERSON> Costa-Gavras </PERSON> -LRB- `` Z,'' `` Missing'' -RRB- and stars Debra Winger and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON>. Winger plays an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who must learn whether <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> farmer, is involved with right-wing extremist activities. The opening scene of `` Betrayed'' shows the murder of a controversial radio personality by a white extremist group, similar to the 1984 slaying of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> talk-show host <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON>. `` I was interested in the subject of the murder of <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> and then I did some research,'' <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said. `` I found this kind of widespread group of extremists. This is a group of people looking to overthrow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government.'' Though the producer does not call `` Betrayed'' a `` message film,'' he hopes it will increase awareness about extremist groups. `` What we say is that you've got to face it,'' he said. `` You ca n't run away. The only problem I can see for the film is not enough people want to recognize that it exists in our country.'' <PERSON> Berenger </PERSON> was the first to be cast. His work as the scarred sergeant in the Academy Award-winning `` Platoon'' attracted the filmmakers. `` We really wanted someone who was very All-American; there are n't that many of them,'' <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> prides himself on the care put into each of his films; his active participation is atypical of film producers. `` Probably in this business, you could n't name more than a dozen really hard-working, caring producers that are involved creatively making the film,'' he said. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> worked as a mailboy, a projectionist and a clapper _ one who goes to live TV shows and applauds and laughs _ before deciding to get into the movie business. He began producing films in the 1960s and had his first major hit in 1969 with `` They Shoot Horses, Do n't They?'' which received nine Academy Award nominations and won the best actor prize for Gig Young. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s biggest success came with `` Rocky,'' which received 10 nominations in 1976 and won the Oscar for best picture. `` It was just a nice little movie, very cheap,'' <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> recalled. `` I think it caught the American conciousness at the time. Maybe because we were just coming out of the -LRB- <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -RRB- war and everybody wanted to believe in something, and here was a character who believed in himself. `` The whole purpose of the movie was, even if you do n't win the title, if you have self-respect it's more important.'' Despite his string of successes, <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, like most producers, is largely unknown to the general public, which tends to associate producers with the financial aspect of the film. `` Most of the producers do n't know what they do. The misconception of the producers' function is really not a misconception. Most producers do n't do a very good job,'' he said. `` That perception of the producer whose just out there packaging all of this is generally right.'' While film critics usually detect a pattern in the films of a certain director or actor, the producer's contribution often remains unnoticed. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> believes a basic theme does exist, a `` Winkler'' trademark, so to speak in many of his films. `` Somebody pointed it out to me that almost every film I'm involved with deals with how people react in a particular situation, usually a situation of stress,'' he said `` Whether it's a guy like Rocky, responding with courage and daring or Debra Winger in ` Betrayed,' if you go through all those films, you find that common thread.'' <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> does not see that pattern in most of the films now being made. `` I think the biggest change in the industry is that the studios have really become conglomerates so there's not the personal touch you used to have.'' He is also concerned about the lack of quality screenplays. `` That's what's hurting the business the most. What we really have to do is show some respect for the writers and encourage more young people to become writers so we'll have better stories.'' Although many of <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s productions have been financially successful, he does not claim any expertise in what makes a film popular at the box office. `` You can never figure,'' he said. `` It's a mysterious set of circumstances.'' As for his movies: `` I'm just trying to tell a nice story. Whether you're a writer or a producer, all you want to do is tell a good yarn.''

<HEAD>Santana Strikes Chord In Musical Scene After Two Decades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When jazz great <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> recently praised the originality of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, the low-key musician expressed satisfaction that he still strikes a singular chord on the musical scene after two decades. `` For Miles to tell me this, hey, that's a great compliment, but it shows that I'm not on stagnant water,'' said <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, who's admired for his stirring guitar solos `` Stagnant water stinks. You need water to go out, you need water to come in _ all the time. And in order to do it, you have to become a student. Once you have a master's and you know everything, it's a drag.'' To keep his music flowing, <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> will release a three-record LP early next month and has launched a tour that reunites <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> `` Chepito'' Areas and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrieve </PERSON>, three original members of the band that evolved during jam sessions in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s heavily Hispanic Mission District. The <ORGANIZATION> Santana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> made its debut in 1968 at the Fillmore West where <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> recently held court at a small side table overlooking busy <PERSON> Geary </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON>, talking about his new album, the feelings behind his music and the popularity of Latin-rhythm groups. The Mexican-born <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1961, entering the national spotlight with a show-stopping performance at <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> in 1969. He has gone on to earn 14 gold albums, nine platinum albums and sell more than 25 million records worldwide. Despite a pocketful of popular hits _ including `` Evil Ways,'' `` Black Magic Woman,'' `` Oye Como Va,'' `` Soul Sacrifice'' and `` Europa'' _ the 41-year-old <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> has continued experimenting. The new anthology, including some unreleased cuts, serves to `` give a testimony of the things we have become and lived.'' `` We're looking to take the music further. I mean, play the music and respect it for the way you play it, but also embrace the future and take some new chances,'' said the slender, mustachioed <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>. `` We want to serve the people with our music,'' he said. `` Music is a healing force if played correctly. I really believe that, aside from being the universal language, it's a healing force and reminds us that we have more things in common than we think.'' For <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, who began playing guitar at age 8, music has never been a strictly commercial endeavor. `` Music is not to make a living,'' he said. `` Music is to help the conditioning of life. People play for many different reasons and all of them according to their heart's capacity. My capacity tells me that I can do a great service by doing music correctly. People know when you're playing something from your heart and when you're just giving lip service.'' Before <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sound Machine began doing the `` Conga'' and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobos </LOCATION> started playing `` Tex-Mex,'' <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> was infusing his music with the `` Latin rhythm.'' In past cuts such as `` Samba Pa Ti,'' `` Oye Como Va'' and `` Black Magic Woman,'' <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> showcased `` salsa'' when it was still considered something to add to Mexican dishes. Still, most of the recent publicity surrounding Hispanic-theme movies _ `` <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bamba </LOCATION>,'' `` Stand and Deliver'' and `` Milagro Beanfield War'' _ and Latin-rhythm musical groups fail to even mention <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>. `` For <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Estefan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobos </LOCATION> and all the other Spanish-speaking people today, if they want to go to the future, they got to go through me first,'' <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> said. On the other hand, <PERSON> Santana </PERSON> expressed satisfaction his music has not been easily categorized, and points out his innovative music has endured for two decades. `` I consider myself a musician and a stylist, in bringing forth a certain thing that all generations can relate to,'' he said. `` That's better for me than being something mega-everything for three years.'' The new album, titled `` <PERSON> Viva </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>!,'' is the latest of 25 LPs released during his career. He also cut albums with Buddy Miles and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. The tour began on Aug. 26 at <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. Some scheduled stops include <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> built up a record in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that departed only occasionally from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's line but along the way he took some positions he does n't mention in his resume. For example, he advocated special tax breaks for smokers, dieters, foreign golfers, batboys and batgirls for professional baseball teams, and college football coaches. The tax breaks for smokers and dieters was proposed in a `` ` Kick the Habit' Tax Credit Bill,'' which he sponsored and which, in the interest of health, would have allowed a tax credit up to $ 150 for half the cost of enrolling in a weight-loss or stop-smoking program. It did n't become law. And <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> once threatened to try to rename <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in honor of former Sen. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartke </PERSON>, D-Ind., unless some <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> lawmakers dropped efforts to rename the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakeshore </ORGANIZATION> in memory of the late Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, D-Ill. During his four years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and almost eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator has been a steady advocate for military spending and for reducing the government's role in daily Some votes have put him at odds with organized labor, veterans and other interest groups. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sought to overhaul federal budget procedures in an effort to cut the budget deficit. He voted for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s big 1981 tax cut and then followed that with votes to raise taxes in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987 _ tax increases that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed after vowing to oppose tax increases. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> now is on record with his running mate, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to oppose future tax increases. On May 10, 1985, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and most other <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans voted for a budget that would have eliminated the cost-of-living increase in Social Security pensions while boosting the defense budget to offset inflation. The vice president broke a 49-49 tie and the budget passed. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subsequently refused to cut the Social Security increases. The 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is best known as an author of the 1982 Job Training Partnership Act, which emphasized involvement of local government and private employers in training young and unskilled workers. His <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> co-author was Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., whose name the Republicans invoke with ridicule on the campaign trail As a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> developed a reputation for learning the intricacies of the defense budget and weapons systems. Few are more vocal in support of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> _ nicknamed Star Wars. After some initial skepticism, he fought tirelessly for approval earlier this year of the U.S.-Soviet arms-limitation treaty and _ to the surprise of some conservatives _ opposed most of a dozen conservative challenges to the pact. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> fought just as consistently against another top initiative of 1988: a Democratic-sponsored bill requiring that large companies give workers at least 60 days' notice before a shutdown. He voted for every effort to water down the bill. He voted for aid to the anti-government rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>; for a constitutional amendment allowing organized prayer in schools; against abortion; against gun control and for capital punishment. Although he endorsed extension of the Voting Rights Act, he fought restoration of some civil-rights protections that had been nullified by a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. Breaking with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he voted to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vetoes of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and of a bill authorizing $ 18 billion in clean-water projects Last year he voted for an $ 88 billion highway-mass-transit bill but would not vote to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of that measure. Here are some other stands taken by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>:

 Twenty-seven times this year Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has voted against the majority of his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on a variety of issues, including <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, abortion and immigration policy, and some of his votes put him at odds with his running mate, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. When 77 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> voted on Feb. 4 against granting $ 60 million to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was on the opposite side. On July 13, 75 percent of Democrats voted against allowing oil drilling in parts of the eastern <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> voted for it. Those votes were an exception for the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, who now is his party's nominee for vice president. During 17 -LCB- years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> he has usually been found in the middle of the pack. Of 212 substantive votes <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has cast this year, 185, or 87 percent, sided with the majority of Democrats. In 1987, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> voted on 408 roll calls, and 90 percent of the time _ on 365 votes _ he sided with most other Democrats. Averaging his annual ratings by the Americans for Democratic Actas,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has said, referring to the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors federal financing of abortions. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> calls the issue one of the toughest for him but generally supports federal money only in the case of rape or incest or when the mother's life would be endangered by carrying a baby to term. On the basic question of abortion, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says, `` It's a woman's right to make that decision after consulting her physician, hopefully her pastor or priest.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> apparently is unequivocally opposed to capital punishment. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has voted for it, most recently on May 16, when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved the death penalty for certain drug-related murders. More than half the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> opposed that bill. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors handgun control; <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is on the other side. On the most recent vote on the issue, in 1987, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> opposed an amendment prohibiting firearms that can not be detected by airport security devices. Seventy-four percent of Democratic senators voted for the amendment. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appear unconcerned about their differences. `` I did n't pick <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to be a clone of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' the presidential nominee explained. `` We agree on most things but we disagree on some.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was in the minority on April 20 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, on a 61-35 vote, killed an amendment that would have required a balanced federal budget before any financial reparations could be paid to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II. Only eight other Democrats were with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on that vote. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> later voted for the reparations bill, which passed 69-27. More than two-thirds of Democrats favored a six-month extension of the amnesty period during which illegal immigrants could apply for legalization. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> voted with most Republicans and the extension failed, 56-40. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, whose state's energy industry is in deep trouble, voted July 13 to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to approve drilling on existing leases in the eastern <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The amendment failed 59-37, with 75 percent of Democrats voting no. On 150 of the 212 substantive votes this year, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> voted on the same side as Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and liberal Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. On 17 occasions, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was aligned against the two; he was allied with <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> against <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on 23 votes; on eight he sided with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> against <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has consistently been among a minority of Democrats on key defense issues; he has been considerably more hawkish. On the 27 votes this year in which <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was opposed by most members of his party, six were on major defense questions, including the MX mobile missile, the Strategic Defense Initiative -LRB- he opposed cuts in both; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes SDI, also known as Star Wars -RRB-, and on requiring the mothballing of two aging aircraft carriers when their replacements are commissioned -LRB- he opposed it -RRB-. Some other key <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> votes this year: _ Down the line against conservative efforts to modify the U.S.-Soviet INF arms treaty _ For the <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> civil rights restoration bill and most attempts to weaken it Against most Democrats, he supported amendments involving abortion and schools controlled by religious organizations. _ For a bill generally prohibiting employers from using lie detectors on employees _ For legislation prohibiting a president from withholding details of covert operations from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ Against a resolution disapproving a U.S.-Japanese agreement on peaceful uses of nuclear energy _ For three major bills that he, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, shepherded through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>: Welfare overhaul, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> benefits for some expenses of catastrophic illness -LRB- with a tax increase on the elderly to pay for them -RRB- and a sweeping trade bill _ For an amendment requiring that government AIDS-related literature emphasize abstinence from illegal drug use and from sex outside a monogamous marriage _ Against stripping federal courts of authority in cases involving disputes about school prayer _ For requiring that lucrative `` golden parachute'' benefits for corporate executives be subject to stockholder approval _ Against requiring written parental consent before government clinics may provide contraceptives to minors _ For creating a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in the Cabinet

<HEAD>Ad Agency Stocks Sidelined This Olympic Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Politicians and Olympic sponsors usually try for the limelight with advertising every four years, but their efforts this year have failed to make ad company stocks stars on Wall Street. Industry analysts estimate that the major advertising stocks as a group have underperformed the broader market by about 10 percent this year. They say the outlook for the group remains tied closely to the performance of the economy next year. `` The industry has gone through three tough years,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON>, who follows the ad business for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>. But he said the rigors of industry consolidation and cost-cutting may have put the group in a position to benefit from whatever surprises may lie ahead. Over the past two years, consolidation created some huge ad holding companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Omnicom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and a bigger <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The publicly-held ad companies also include <ORGANIZATION> Interpublic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Belding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Simultaneously, agencies were laying off workers and taking other cost-cutting steps. <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON> estimates ad industry employment is down 3 percent to 5 percent from a year ago. The belt-tightening came in time for the industry to reap earnings benefits from ad spending growth expected due to the elections and the Olympic Games. But the anticipated spurt has largely failed to materialize. In June, the industry guru <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> of the ad agency <ORGANIZATION> McCann-Erickson </ORGANIZATION> scaled back his estimate of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ad spending growth for the year to 8.4 percent, down from the 9 percent gain he had forecast six months earlier. Some other ad industry analysts expect even slower growth. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, who follows advertising stocks for <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the quadrennial year is turning out to be a big zero.'' He expects an increase excluding direct mail spending of 5 percent to 6 percent this year. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said the economy is at a different stage in the business cycle than it was when ad spending climbed at double-digit rates in 1976 and 1984. `` The economic news this year has n't been bad, but it has n't been as good as it was in those years at the beginning of a big expansion,'' he said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, who follows the ad business for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ad spending should rise about 7 percent this year. He said spending did n't get its normal quadrennial lift because consumer spending increases have been anemic. That hurt ad stocks, he said, because `` the market has been shying away from consumer cyclical stocks this year.'' Looking ahead, <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> expects ad spending will grow 7.5 percent in 1989, while <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> expect growth roughly matching this year's pace. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> noted that commercial time is sold out on the summer Olympics broadcasts, and that advance sales of time on the three major television networks for the fall exceeded last year's strong totals. But even so, he said `` I do n't have anybody telling me clients are increasing their budgets.'' <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said a pickup may occur in consumer spending as the trauma of last fall's stock market crash recedes, and said that would make the case `` for 1989 not being a bad year at all.'' As a result he finds the ad stocks `` attractive, with the caveat that I do n't expect a recession before 1990.'' In their search for new ways to generate revenue, some of the major ad agencies have been buying marketing services firms that offer the consulting, promotion and design work that ad companies once spurned. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said the results from this shopping spree have been mixed. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> said a gradual movement by major advertisers away from the flat-fee system of compensating ad agencies could be a boon to well-managed agencies. Under some new methods, agencies are taking lower base rates but get incentive payments if their advertising works, boosting sales or market share. <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON> said the recent pace of new product introductions indicates that consumer products companies are taking risks and becoming more agressive. That could be a plus for ad companies because new product rollouts usually mean more advertising. He is not pushing the group, but feels good about it. `` If there are no surprises, the ad stocks go sideways,'' <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON> said. `` But if we see some surprises, the surprises will likely be on the good side and the stocks are going to go up.''

 Ever alert for investment opportunities, many Americans have been burned in recent years by unscrupulous operators promoting overpriced art and collectors coins, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> warns. While both rare coins and art can prove good investments, avoiding mistakes requires either considerable knowledge or reliance on a trustworthy adviser. Perhaps the most important thing to avoid is allowing oneself to be pressured into a quick decision, especially by a telephone salesperson, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> says. And do not give out credit card numbers or bank account numbers to anyone calling you. Often salespeople will claim you have won some sort of contest and the numbers are needed for `` verification.'' Do n't fall for it, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> warns, you risk big losses by giving out such numbers to unfamiliar callers. Salespeople often try to snow buyers with tales of big increases in the value of prints or coins. In the case of art they will sometimes ghoulishly claim the artist is seriously ill and that, when he dies, the price will skyrocket. But the technology for reproducing pictures is excellent today, so that what is claimed to be a limited edition print worth $ 500 to $ 3,500 can in fact turn out to be a good quality reproduction, worth $ 50 at best. `` Therefore, it is very important to consult a reputable local authority on the subject, such as an art appraiser or museum curator, before purchasing any work of art,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> says in a new consumer fact sheet on art fraud. Copies of the alert, as well as <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> investor alerts on Rare Coins, <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telemarketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraud </ORGANIZATION> can be obtained, at no charge, by writing: Public Reference, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, 20580. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> urges consumers to be skeptical of claims of authenticity for coins and art, noting that crooks often print up fraudulent certificates or authenticity for art or fake coin grading certificates. They sometimer refer buyers to `` experts'' who are actually paid by them, and may promise refunds which they later refuse to make good on. It can help to check out sellers with the local <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, consumer office or state attorney general's office. But remember, it is n't unusual for a company to change its name periodically to avoid being identified with past complaints. Whatever the situation, do n't be rushed, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> urges, no offer is so good that it can not wait for a cool, professional examination. `` Ask yourself: if this offer is so good, why is a total stranger making the effort to sell me this investment?'' the agency suggests. In the case of rare coins, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> suggests checking with professional organizations to see if the dealer is a member in good standing before sending any money. These groups include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Numismatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Colo </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tangible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Numismatists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, born into a world of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> privilege and conservative causes, preached the gospel of rock-ribbed Republicanism long before he ever walked the corridors of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or became <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. `` Politics comes naturally to the family,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, retired editor of the nearby Fort Wayne News Sentinel. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> represents the fulfillment of a family dream.'' In his road to the Republican ticket, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> never wavered in his personal or political leanings: the popular fraternity boy became an amiable candidate, the teen who learned golf made the game his passion, the youth who displayed a <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> sticker on his car in the'60s proudly voted for the tenets of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution from his back bench in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Back at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1960s, `` He was basically a little political commentator,'' recalls <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> fraternity brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Socolofsky </PERSON>. `` I think you genuinely could see something light up there. There was definitely a spark.'' `` He was really well versed,'' he added. `` It was obvious that was the fabric of the family.'' However, not everyone saw him quite that way. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` undistinguished'' and `` mediocre,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> professor who taught <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> constitutional law. `` He did n't work very hard. He was not very bright. He did n't get much done.'' Asked about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> being chosen for the No. 2 spot on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said: `` It confirms what I was told when I was a little kid, that anybody can grow up to be president.'' In the days since <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was anointed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the fabric of his family has turned into political drama as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> struggled to vindicate himself amid a torrent of controversy about his lackluster academic career, his personal life and most of all, his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> service during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War _ and whether he used family clout to secure bullet-free duty. In a matter of days, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, the first baby boomer on a national ticket, has catapulted from relative obscurity to the withering glare of the limelight, a man on the hot seat, a second-term senator vying to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. `` From a guy who could walk down the street unrecognized, bang, he's suddenly put in the spotlight,'' law school friend and federal appeals Judge <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> said this week. `` He was unprepared and that's probably not a very good way to put a vice president in.'' If this is a test of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s mettle, he'll pass with flying colors, his friends believe. `` From everything I have seen, he's demonstrating very definite resilience,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s former economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION>. `` He'll survive very well.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> surely inherited his fervor for conservative politics from his grandfather, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, a media mogul who founded a multi-million-dollar newspaper empire that includes the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Phoenix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gazette </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> family owns the <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> -LRB- Ind. -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, is publisher; the senator, who worked as a young associate publisher before entering politics, is vice president. The circulation of the paper is less than 9,000. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent his childhood in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, moving west with his family as a small boy in the mid'50s when his father helped run the <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON> newspapers. They returned to <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> in 1963 when <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> was a high school junior. For <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, life in this rural <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> town was filled with penny-ante poker games with his buddies, dancing to juke box tunes at the now-defunct Swing Inn, part of the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION>, and cruising down <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, stopping at the A & amp; W Root Beer stand and the Penguin Point drive-in. `` He had a regular kid existence,'' said high school pal <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Cope </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area cardiologist. `` It's been said he was a rich kid, but that never showed when he was a teen. He did n't have his own car.'' He borrowed his mother's. As a senior in college, he was a big man on campus _ and drove a beat-up International Scout. Already, his political philosophy was forming. `` He was very, very conservative at the time. He was pro <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Cope </PERSON> recalled. `` He was pro-war because the president was pro-war. <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who dated <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in high school, told a reporter <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had a bumper sticker on his car with the chemical symbols for gold and water. `` And he said in this big voice, ` And that is the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''' The conservative sentiment, light years away from the angry chants and window-smashing rampages of the anti-Vietnam protests, also prevailed at <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION>, a small, upper middle-class liberal arts college in <LOCATION> Greencastle </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> majored in political science. `` It was not a very controversial social environment,'' said <PERSON> Socolofsky </PERSON>. `` The war was n't even debated in classrooms there.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, economist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> and a former fraternity brother, was a freshman when <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was a pledge trainer. `` I remember the night <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was elected in 1968. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> had a party in his room. There were a couple of TVs going. The only thing I can remember he -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- was at the convention _ he was an usher to the stage _ he really got a big kick out of that. `` The Democrats were studying somewhere, I suppose.''

 Following his father's and grandfather's footsteps, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> _ also <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s fraternity at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> _ and became vice president at the so-called campus `` animal house.'' `` We were the beer generation,'' <PERSON> Socolofsky </PERSON> added. `` We really enjoyed getting a keg of beer, putting some music on and having dates.'' Whatever the trend on other campuses, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he never used or even experimented with marijuana. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was popular, making friends easily. He also was a premier golfer. But his academic record was less impressive. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says he was the `` proverbial C-plus'' student, but he flunked a comprehensive political exam he needed to graduate. He later took a different test and passed. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Katula </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION>'s athletic director and former golf coach, says <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` was a very tough competitor. I liked his confidence. It gave me confidence. ... He's very aggressive. ... I'd like to have six <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayles </PERSON> playing for me.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s none-too-stellar academic career later became a touchy topic when <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> faculty members rejected a proposal to award the senator an honorary law degree. They later reversed themselves after the university president appealed. After college, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> entered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> at the height of the war. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> editor and a family friend, said he recommended <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to a top Guard official, who asked the guard personnel office to put a slot `` on hold'' for him. He was brought aboard as a welder before being shifted to a public relations post. Questions about whether the hawkish <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> pulled strings to avoid the front lines have dogged the senator, who at week's end refused to answer any more questions about it. `` I was not seeking special treatment,'' he said. `` No rules were broken.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also denied suggestions this week that clout got his son into <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> when his grades could n't. His father told a reporter that `` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>'s -LRB- a -RRB- pretty good salesman,'' who talked his way into law school, arguing <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> was tougher than other schools. In law school, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, another law student. They wed after a 10-week courtship and have three children. Associates say the <ORGANIZATION> Quayles </ORGANIZATION> live a middle-class existence in suburban northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> cutting and styling her husband's hair, and both sharing parental duties, such as babysitting. Starting out in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> worked as investigator for the state attorney general's office, administrative assistant to the governor and at the <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> paper before a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> official, Orvas Beers, approached him to challenge Democratic eight-term Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Roush </PERSON> in 1976. He is `` a real charmer,'' <PERSON> Beers </PERSON> says now. `` ` I thought he'd get a lot of the women's vote because of his friendliness, his personality and his good looks.'' <PERSON> Beers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took to politics naturally. `` Only one time did I ever have to suggest anything. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> was standing talking to a group of people -LRB- when he was running for the first time -RRB-. I said, ` <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>, get yourself out and shaking hands. He did n't argue a bit. And he did n't stop shaking hands the rest of the campaign.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s former press secretary, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said the blue-eyed, blond senator bristles at talk about his looks and comparisons to matinee idol <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. `` He wanted to be taken seriously. He wanted to be taken as a professional trying to do a job,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, news director of <ORGANIZATION> WHAS-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. One day a trade group from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> visited <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s office, and as is custom, they were asked if they wanted a photo taken with the senator One woman in particular `` was thrilled,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> recalls. `` She made a compliment about his beautiful blue eyes. He was very embarrassed. He tried to lighten the moment. He said, ` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>'s got blue eyes.''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> served two terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before defeating three-term Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> in the 1980 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslide. `` Taking on <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, it gives you an idea about his competitiveness,'' <PERSON> Katula </PERSON> said. `` He's not afraid to take a chance. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> easily won re-election in 1986 and is known as an expert on defense issues and an ardent supporter of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars anti-missile shield. He also led the administration fight against providing advance notice of plant closings and wrote the Job Training Partnership Act, a nationwide employment program. Earlier in his career, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was on the fringes of a scandal that resurfaced with his nomination to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ticket. In 1981, an insurance industry lobbyist, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, said she had had a relationship with a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> congressman and shared a vacation house in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> a year earlier with him and two other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, one of whom was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Playboy magazine, for whom <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> subsequently posed, reported this week that she will say in an upcoming issue that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> propositioned her and she refused. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has angrily denied the accusation and said he was there on a golfing outing. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> says of his ex-boss: `` I never saw <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> give a second look to any woman. He was as straight an arrow you'd ever want to meet.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has a hard time keeping on schedule. He said one day they were running from one meeting to another and they were trying to get to an airport. `` We passed a driving range and I'm watching the clock. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made them stop. `` Dan picked up a can of balls and he fired off a few,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, while they anxiously waited. `` That was his release and his relaxation.'' They made it to the airport. Friends say that although they're a little surprised at <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s fast climb up the political ladder, he's used his assets well `` What he's done shows he had some talent and organization and friends in the right places,'' Cope says. `` His success speaks well for himself.''

 Government figures indicate the economy, shaking off the drag caused by the drought, grew at the surprisingly brisk annual pace of 3.3 percent in the second quarter, while inflation hit a six-year peak of 5.1 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the gain in the gross national product would have soared beyond the 3.3 percent clip had it not been for a larger-than-expected $ 9.5 billion loss in farm production.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Down Sharply In Volatile Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Oil futures prices finished sharply lower in volatile trading, as the market hit a bearish downturn after reports of higher <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, contracts for October delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 37 cents a barrel to close at $ 15.31 Thursday. October crude closed 2 cents lower in Wednesday's trading. Contracts for September delivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline dropped 1.07 cents to finish at 46.44 cents a gallon. Most other contract months for gasoline also declined. Wholesale heating oil for September fell 1.30 cents to 42.45 cents a gallon. Analysts said the October contract for crude oil tumbled below a critical technical level of $ 15.50 a barrel on reports that production by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> had surged anew. `` Reports that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production has reached 19.5 million to 20 million barrels a day caused a sharp decline in the market today,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market also broke a key technical level.'' Analysts said that once the market hit $ 15.50 a barrel, negative sentiment took over, sending prices even lower. The oil futures market has been largely inactive in recent weeks, without much fresh news on supply and demand to guide it. Analysts said Thursday's reports provided the first sign of direction in some time, and speculated that prices could weaken further as the increased oil outflow reaches consuming nations. `` It looks like we're about to start a move to the down side,'' <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> said. Last week, the market focused on developments in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and a tentative cease-fire between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Analysts have speculated that an end to the fighting between the two <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations could mean the fractious 13-member oil cartel would set production limits, thus helping to raise world oil prices. But on Thursday, analysts said the market reacted to rumors that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had refused to go along with a quota proposed by other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members.

<HEAD>Boeing Sets Industry Record For Single-Year Commercial Jet Orders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Strong world economies, attractive airline fares and a movement by airlines to more fuel-efficient aircraft have helped <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> break its own 10-year-old record for commercial jets ordered in a year, the company says. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that an <ORGANIZATION> Linjeflyg </ORGANIZATION>, a domestic Swedish airline, had ordered six 737-500 jetliners and took options on six more, giving <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 466 jetliner orders for the year. That broke the old record of 461 planes <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> set in 1978. The order, worth more than $ 175 million, boosted the dollar value of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s announced 1988 orders to $ 20.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> several weeks ago surpassed the record of $ 19.9 billion in new orders set last year. `` This represents four consecutive years of record orders for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference. `` This has been a very good year,'' added <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON>, vice president of sales for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> operating company. `` Next year, we're forecasting to have a reasonable year, perhaps not as good as this one.'' Still, <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is predicting that over the next two decades, the world's airlines will need almost as many new planes as the 8,171 now in service, and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> should continue to provide the largest share. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> this year picked up a number of large orders, including 15 747-400 jumbo jets by <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, 50 757s by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, 30 757s by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and the biggest commercial jetliner order ever, a $ 4.6 billion deal with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for 100 aircraft. In addition, both <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rolls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> have said they may be interested in ordering large numbers of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes, possibly this year. `` With the possible order of up to 50 757s pending with <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rolls </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> order and another possible 75 jets which could be used in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s long-range anti-submarine warfare patrol aircraft program, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> could keep going like gangbusters,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, an aerospace analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has benefited from strong world economies that permit people to travel. Airline fares also are attractive, he said, particularly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Further, airlines are starting to turn to more fuel-efficient and economical aircraft, including new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes that <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON> said are significantly cheaper to operate and far quieter than earlier jets. <PERSON> Hayhurst </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> predicts that air traffic growth will continue at about 5 percent a year through 2005. `` All of this means a significant amount of traffic growth in the next 17 years,'' he said. `` In fact, in the year 2005, that 5 percent traffic will mean that the traffic growth will be about 2 -LCB- times what it is today. And we forseee a requirement for about 7,400 airplanes, new airplanes, in that delivery timeframe.'' <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> now has backlog of 1,036 jets, the industry's highest, which translates to years of work on its commercial production lines. Presently, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is turning out 14 737s and four 757s a month at its <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, plant, with 757 production to increase to five a month next February, <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON> said. The company is making five widebody 767s and three 747s a month at its <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, plant, but plans to boost that rate to five jumbo jets a month by mid-1989, he said. He declined to say whether these plans mean additional hiring at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which now employs about 92,000 people in the Puget Sound region. Stockholm-based <ORGANIZATION> Linjeflyg </ORGANIZATION>, a new customer for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, will take delivery of the first of the 108-passenger 737-500s in February 1991. The new jets will be powered by CFM56-3B1 engines. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed down 12 -LCB- cents a share Thursday, at $ 58.62 -LCB-, after rising $ 2.12 -LCB- a share Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 The dollar held steady against major currencies in calm European trading today as the market reassessed trends following a round of interest rate hikes. Gold prices rose. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was weaker in early trading in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> but was recovering later in European markets after short-covering and profit-taking on long non-dollar positions. On Thursday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency fell after the West German central bank raised its discount rate by half a point to 3.5 percent. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> also hiked their key rates. It was also pushed lower after <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON> said the West German central bank `` will continue to do everything to stem the decline of the Deutsche mark against the dollar.'' One trader said Friday that the market was taking a breather following the activity caused by interest rate increases. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar fell 0.26 yen to a closing 133.50 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 133.75 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.8630 West German marks, unchanged from Thursday; 1.5730 Swiss francs, up from 1.5715; 6.3332 French francs, up from 6.3275; 2.1042 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1030; 1,385.75 Italian lire, up from 1,384.13; and 1.2365 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2342 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was trading at $ 1.6950, cheaper for buyers than Thursday's late $ 1.6995.

 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s decision to raise key interest rates resulted in a plunge in share prices and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar on <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> markets Friday. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 321.47 points during the morning session, stayed almost even in the afternoon to finish the day at 27,565.41. The market shed 305.03 points, or 1.09 percent, which is the biggest one-day decline since Aug. 10, when it lost 615.49 points. `` The decision to raise key interest rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> shocked many investors and froze them,'' said a stock dealer at a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We've already had enough unfavorable external factors one after another,'' he added, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the market is unlikely to rebound because investors are still waiting to see how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will react to the interest rate rise in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to the dealer. Other dealers said the decline of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stocks overnight and an upward revision for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> second-quarter GNP weighed on sentiment. Volume traded on the first section was 450 million shares. The dollar, which opened at 133.58 yen, closed at 133.50 yen, down 0.26 yen from Thursday's close of 133.76 yen. The currency ranged between 133.35 and 133.73 yen. The dollar's fall was largely attributed to dollar selling in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as the German <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> recovered after European countries decided to raise their key interest rates. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s council meeting decided Thursday to raise the discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 3.5 percent, in a coordinated move with six other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries including <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

 Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> today welcomed Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and said his visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will lift relations between the two countries to a new level. The meeting in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION> came a day after <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will provide $ 6.4 billion in credit for Chinese development projects from 1990 to 1995. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> held extensive talks with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> shortly after his arrival on a six-day visit Thursday, and also met today with President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> and Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, the guiding force in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s past decade of economic reforms, said he was enthusastic about cooperation between the two nations. `` With your visit, Sino-Japanese friendly relations will certainly reach a new level,'' he said. The 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, a military strategist in the 1937-45 war against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, has been sharply critical of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the past. Japanese officials said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> spoke optimistically of the future and avoided the controversial subjects that have marred bilateral relations in recent years. Those include <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s former trade surplus _ now reversed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s favor _ <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s perception of a rise in Japanese militarism and a court case which awarded a <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION> student dormitory, claimed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> told <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reforms have now entered a difficult phase and mentioned that prices are rising rapidly. The officials quoted <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> as saying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, now trying to end price controls, will need five years to fully stabilize its pricing system. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, according to the officials, said introducing more foreign investment and technology would help <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy. On Saturday, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expect to sign an investment protection agreement which both sides hope will encourage Japanese businesses to invest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In the past year, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has resigned from almost all his official positions, although he still wields considerable influence in government and party policy. The officials said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> discussed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, the 81-year-old ceremonial head of state. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> explained <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s position of encouraging more contacts with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would be interested in meeting directly with officials of the rival Nationalist government, the officials said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, according to the officials, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> welcomes a recent relaxation of China-Taiwan tensions, including a lifting of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s ban on visits to the mainland. No details were immediately available on the meeting with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Iowa Farmers Begin Idaho Hay Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Another 15,000 acres of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> grasslands were opened to drought-plagued <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers for hay harvesting, but organizers said more equipment was needed to take advantage of the bonus. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Soil Conservation Service officials said Thursday the number of acres available for harvest in northern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> had been increased to 20,000 from the original 4,500 acres. `` We have the manpower we need, but not all the equipment,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the project in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Organizers said local farmers and implement dealers were continuing to donate equipment for the harvest, but there was still a need for swathers, hay balers and tractors, he said. <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> is donating railcars to ship the hay back to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Farmers in the <LOCATION> Colfax </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, area also donated more than 1,000 bales of their own hay to the Iowans. Midwestern farmers lost as much as 75 percent of their hay crop to the worst drought in 50 years this summer. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> originally estimated as much as 5,000 tons of hay could be harvested on the original 4,500 acres. It was not known how much could be expected to be harvested on 20,000 acres. The 64 men, women and teen-agers arrived Tuesday after a 40-hour, 1,600-mile bus trip from south and central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. After a hearty farm breakfast at a Grange hall Thursday, the Iowans began harvesting the hay they hope will feed their hungry livestock back home. `` They were really getting itchy to get some work done,'' <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said. Hay mowers began cutting grass on fields near <LOCATION> Deary </LOCATION>, about 30 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, on land set aside in a government erosion-control program. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> recently released the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> land, which is normally not farmed, for harvest by drought-afflicted farmers. The harvest could take as long as 10 days, but cutting and baling must be finished by Aug. 31, a deadline set by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said organizers have notified the office of Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, that they may have to ask for an extension from Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. The generosity of their agricultural colleagues and the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> community was overwhelming, the Iowans said. Harvest equipment was donated by local farmers and implement dealers. `` I'd be a bit leery if someone wanted to use my equipment,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibbals </PERSON>, a dairyman from <LOCATION> Albia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> toured a high-tech specialty steel plant with four other Northeastern governors and then promised, if elected president, to create a national center for steel technology to help the industry find new markets. `` We ca n't have a growing national economy without a strong steel industry,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> on Thursday for a two-day Conference of Northeastern Governors. Among flying sparks and penetrating heat, the governors toured <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludlum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s advanced technology steel plant in <LOCATION> Brackenridge </LOCATION>, where computer-guided furnaces and machinery turn out stainless steel for the nation's largest specialty steelmaker. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he was pleased to learn from <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludlum </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> that the average worker at the plant, which employs almost 2,800 about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, earns $ 31,000 a year. `` That's what <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I mean when we talk about good jobs at good wages,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was joined at the plant by <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> is chairman of this year's conference and selected the theme _ `` Sustaining Northeast Manufacturing: A Key To Economic Vitality.''

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Fall to Seven-Year Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The price of cocoa on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market dropped to its lowest level in seven years Friday. In morning dealings, cocoa beans for December delivery changed hands at 831 pounds -LRB- $ 1,404 -RRB- per metric ton, a loss of 24 pounds -LRB- $ 40 -RRB- on last night's close and the lowest price for cocoa since June 1981, traders said. A metric ton is equivalent to 2,204.62 pounds. The market's weakness reflects the prospect that 1988-89, which runs between October and September, could be the fifth consecutive season of overproduction, the sources added. Hopes are also dwindling that <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> producer and consumer member countries can settle differences and open the way for new price-support measures. The two sides meet here next month to discuss a possible stockpiling scheme, but its introduction depends on agreement on the minimum price that should be defended and payment by producers of arrears to the organization, industry sources said. Crop prospects in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the Far East are said to be better than at this time last year, when drought was causing some concern, and another record crop is therefore in prospect for 1988-89. Latest figures from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and private traders indicate that the current 1988-87 crop will reach an all-time high of more than 2 million metric tons. Many countries, including the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, are expecting record 1987-88 production figures. Traders said that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> _ the world's biggest cocoa producer _ could harvest an even bigger crop in 1988-89 than this season's estimated 630,000 to 645,000 tons. Such a prospect would increase pressure on the country's cocoa marketing authorities to relax their present reserve selling strategy. Since April, the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> has been refusing offers under 1,300 per ton for its high-quality cocoa, Ivorian officials said. This has pushed up the price for best quality beans generally, but there is a big surplus of poorer quality cocoa that is depressing the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, traders said.

 The desert locust plague in central and east <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will `` explode'' in the next two weeks, causing severe damage to crops, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> warned Friday. `` The extent of infestation in certain African countries is enormous, and we are extremely concerned,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> Director-General <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> said in a statement. `` There is no doubt that there will be heavy damage to crops in the middle of the agricultural season.'' Dr. <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brader </PERSON>, head of the agency's emergency center for locust operations, said that 6 to 7 million hectares -LRB- 14 to 17 million acres -RRB- of land in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> are currently infested with dense bands of locust larvae. `` They are going to explode in the next two weeks and form massive swarms which will affect large areas of agricultural lands,'' he said, adding that the size of each swarm could cover hundreds of square kilometers. `` The plague has reached unprecedented proportions and can not be controlled in the near future,'' <PERSON> Brader </PERSON> said. Heavy rains, particulary in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, have created favorable breeding conditions for the locusts. While the situation has been serious for several weeks in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, the problem has sharply worsened recently in <LOCATION> Niger </LOCATION> with some 1.7 million hectares -LRB- 4.2 million acres -RRB- infested, <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> said it has convened a meeting of affected and interested countries in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> next week.

<HEAD>States Investigating Food Companies' Advertising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight states want to find out whether claims made by dozens of food companies in advertising are misleading. Authorities in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> are examining advertising that could lead consumers to believe that some products are low in such substances as cholesterol, sugars and fats, officials said. The states have been cooperating in a summerlong investigation, <PERSON> Norine </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson-Elm </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> special assistant attorney general, said Thursday. `` We are not challenging ingredients,'' Ms. <PERSON> Olson-Elm </PERSON> said from her <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, office. `` We are concerned about advertising and labeling, how products are marketed and promoted to the public.'' The states have not decided how to proceed if they find evidence of false or deceptive advertising, but they ultimately could sue the companies, the attorney said. Fines would range from $ 2,500 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to $ 25,000 in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> for each violation, she said. The states started the investigation because the claims in some of the advertising were not covered by federal law, Ms. <PERSON> Olson-Elm </PERSON> said. `` Consumers interpret light to mean low in calories rather than light in color and texture,'' Ms. <PERSON> Olson-Elm </PERSON> said. `` Light is not defined by federal law. Consumers have no clear perception other than it is a reduction.'' Five companies known to be under scrutiny are <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>; Kitchens of <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brands </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Madison </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Such diverse products as soup, cereal, cheesecake and meats are involved. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to provide information substantiating its claims that its all-vegetable Crisco shortening contains no cholesterol. Spokesmen for the companies said they stand behind the advertising. The investigation covers television, radio and print advertising regarding nutrition and such ailments as heart problems, cancer and osteoporosis. Companies have been asked to provide samples of advertising, Ms. <PERSON> Olson-Elm </PERSON> said. `` We have set different deadlines for each company,'' she said. `` There is no one target date.'' One concern of the states is the use of palm oil, which Ms. <PERSON> Olson-Elm </PERSON> said is higher in saturated fat than many other oils. Although soybean oil is the primary ingredient in P & amp; G's Crisco shortening _ advertised as being cholesterol-free _ it contains some palm oil. `` Studies indicate that saturated fats in palm oil will increase cholesterol, and therefore we are concerned about palm oil being included in products that are otherwise lower in saturated fats,'' Ms. <PERSON> Olson-Elm </PERSON> said. Cholesterol is a fatty substance in the blood that clogs arteries, often contributing to heart attacks. Palm oil is added to Crisco to give it texture at room temperature, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tassone </PERSON> said. The saturated fat content of palm oil is 40 percent. But because of the relatively small amount of it in Crisco, the overall level of saturated fats in Crisco is 28 percent, <PERSON> Tassone </PERSON> said. He said palm oil, as a vegetable oil, does not contain cholesterol.

 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that its profit after taxes surged 18.9 percent in its latest fiscal year from the year before. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest automaker said in an annual report released Friday that its profit rose to 238.01 billion Japanese yen, or around $ 1.78 billion, in the fiscal year ended June 30 from 200.21 billion yen, or $ 1.50 billion, in the previous year.

<TEXT>
 Newly elected R.P. <ORGANIZATION> Scherer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> directors who favor selling the gelatin capsule maker have asked a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court to seat them immediately. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Souris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> filed suit Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> asking that they be declared winners in a recent proxy contest. But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dow </PERSON>, one of the apparent losing nominees, filed a <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> complaint contesting the proxy results. Dow argued he should have been re-elected because the final tabulations excluded about 310,000 votes meant for him. Dow backs Scherer management, led by chief executive officer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, which advocates keeping the company independent. Dow was defeated by <LOCATION> Souris </LOCATION>, who was backed by <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, daughter of the company's late founder and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>'s estranged wife Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>, her brother, are both directors. They control about 38 percent of the company. Despite <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherer </PERSON>'s re-election and the election of <LOCATION> Souris </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, management still maintains a 6-5 majority. Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> said she would seek support from other directors for her plan to sell the company. In results announced Wednesday, <LOCATION> Souris </LOCATION> received 3,019,449 votes to 2,670,876 for Dow. Dow claimed 75,000 shares voted by <ORGANIZATION> SLH </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> in favor of <LOCATION> Souris </LOCATION> actually had been acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Bessemer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

He also said 235,200 shares voted in his favor by a trustee, <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION>, should have been counted. The votes were n't counted after Mrs. <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, a beneficiary of the trust, obtained a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling saying the shares should n't be voted.

<HEAD>Income Up As Spending Surge Slows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal incomes climbed a healthy 0.6 percent in July while consumer spending slowed from its breakneck pace of the previous month, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the increase in incomes matched a 0.6 percent rise in June and would have been even stronger except for a drop in government subsidy payments to farmers. Personal consumption spending, which includes virtually everything except interest payments on debt, rose 0.5 percent in July, less than half the 1.1 percent rise in June. The report attributed much of the slowdown to a decline in sales of new cars. The slower consumer spending was seen as good news for the economy because of worries that demand this year has been outstripping the ability of factories to produce the goods, thus creating rising inflationary pressures. The income gain looked particularly impressive because the key component, wages and salaries, shot up 1 percent during the month, reflecting continued strong employment gains. This was offset somewhat by a $ 9 billion rate of decline for farm subsidy payments. Excluding these payments, which show extreme month-to-month volatility, personal incomes would have risen 0.8 percent in July. Americans' disposable, or after-tax incomes, rose 0.6 percent in July, down only slightly from a 0.7 percent June increase. With incomes rising slightly faster than spending, the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable incomes, edged up to 4.3 percent in July, compared to 4.2 percent in June. Following the 1.1 percent rise in spending in June, which had been the biggest advance in 10 months, the 0.5 percent July increase reflected gains in purchases of non-durable goods and services. Non-durable goods spending rose at an annual rate of $ 3.5 billion compared to a $ 5.5 billion June increase. Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, increased $ 12.2 billion following an even stronger $ 18.6 billion June increase. But purchases of durable goods showed no change at all following a $ 12 billion rise in June because sales of new cars fell during July.

 The son of hamburger magnate <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> admitted under oath to insider trading, saying he ordered the sale of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> Enterprises securities when he found out the company was about to have a drop in earnings, according to federal documents. The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said in recently filed papers that <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> hould be found guilty and fined without a trial because the admissions clearly established guilt. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> is expected to rule on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s motion for a summary judgment on Sept 12, it was disclosed this week. The younger <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers during an out-of-court hearing in 1985 that he did n't believe he was doing anything wrong by selling the debentures to the company that operates the <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. fast-food chain four days before the firm's losses were publicized `` I firmly believe that it was my legal right to sell those ... at the time if I was selling it at a loss,'' <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> told the lawyers. <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> saved at least $ 10,500 by selling the debentures and avoiding the drop in market price, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> says. Insider trading charges have been filed against <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, his father and 13 other family members. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> alleges the elder <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> illegally tipped off some of his relatives in 1984 that the Anaheim-based company was headed for a drop in earnings.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has proposed a trust agreement in which <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> would take control of <ORGANIZATION> Resorts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock and then place the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino under a trust headed by a former industry executive. The <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was to rule today on the proposal, which could clear the way for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to apply for interim authorization to run the casino. He is trying to buy it from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and other shareholders. This morning, Resorts International adjourned a special stockholders meeting in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> because not enough votes were cast to approve <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s offer to acquire the hotel-casino business. Company head I.G. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> erroneously reported the meeting would be held Sept. 13 so an insufficient number of votes were cast. The meeting was scheduled to resume Tuesday at 3 p.m. at the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino, he said. Under a proposal outlined to the commission Thursday by lawyer <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Casiello </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, solely owned by the former talk show host, would take control of the Resorts stock. The company in turn would be placed under a trust headed by <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Luciani </PERSON>, a former casino executive. The state Attorney General's Office has opposed that arrangement. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> told commissioners the stock should be placed directly under the control of the trust, rather than <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s company. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has agreed to buy Resorts stock for about $ 300 million and sell back to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> the unfinished Taj Mahal casino complex. The deal is contingent on state approval of a trust agreement and an interim authorization for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to operate the casino.

 A federal bankruptcy judge ruled today that former financier <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> can not escape the payment of $ 22 million in restitution he was ordered to make by an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> court. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, special prosecutor for the state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said the order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> was `` very significant.'' <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> granted the state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s motion for summary judgment in the case. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, 69, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, owned the Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which collapsed in 1985 after losing $ 144 million in investments. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was sentenced in March 1987 by an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> judge to 3 -LCB- years in prison and ordered to pay $ 22 million in restitution after he was convicted of six counts of unauthorized acts and three counts of securities fraud in connection with the bank's failure. He is appealing that conviction and sentence. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, who filed for reorganization of his finances under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in October 1987, had sought a ruling that he was no longer liable for restitution ordered by the state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> because he had filed for bankruptcy. But the judge ruled <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> `` can not avoid the $ 22 million order through the bankruptcy mechanism,'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. The ruling, <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said, will allow the state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to proceed against <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to collect the money, including any future assets he may obtain. According to <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s financial schedules, creditors are seeking to recover $ 4.5 billion from him. He claimed he has only $ 384 million in assets.

 The stock market posted some modest gains today, and analysts said it was taking its cue from some strength in the bond market. The pace of trading slowed from this week's already sluggish rate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which marked the first anniverasry of its peak by falling 15.82 points on Thursday, was up 6.93 at 2,017.78 at noontime. Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of 6 to 5 among issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 612 up, 535 down and 578 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume amounted to 45.00 million shares as of noon on Wall Street compared with 67.45 million shares at the same point Thursday. `` There have been some very selective areas that have been trying to pull ahead, but there is no conviction. The market has been in this holding pattern for most of this week,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to push interest rates higher have weighed on the market On Thursday, the government revised upward its earlier estimates of both economic growth and inflation in the second quarter. Coupled with a round of interest rate hikes in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the news sent stock prices broadly lower. But today, the government reported personal income rose by 0.6 percent in July, a bit below expectations, while personal spending rose 0.5 percent. Analysts said those reports calmed worries that inflationary pressures were continuing to build. After the report, bond prices moved higher. That sent yields on the closely-watched 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond, for instance, to 9.42 percent from 9.45 percent late Thursday. Stocks, which had opened mixed, then also moved slightly higher. Among the most active issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sunshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> slipped \ to 3 ~, <ORGANIZATION> Wickes </ORGANIZATION> was up \ at 13 \ and <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> was up \ at 47 In over-the-counter trading, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> was up -LRB- at 70 -LRB-.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices closed lower on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange Friday as concerns over rising global interest rates and poor British trade figures continued to unsettle the market. Trading dwindled almost to a standstill during the afternoon as most players covered positions ahead of the three-day bank holiday weekend in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, dealers said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index finished down 9.5 points, or .05 percent, at 1,770.7. Volume was a moderate 415.6 million shares, compared with the 524.1 million shares traded Thursday. However, most of the session's volume was recorded during the course of the morning and a scant 18.2 million shares changed hands in the last hour of trading. Analysts said the market was still reeling from Thursday's news that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit widened to 2.15 billion pounds in July, from about 1 billion pounds in June. The trade deficit, double the market's expectations, provoked the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> to signal a 1 percent hike in British commercial banks' base lending rates to 12 percent. `` The market is clearly taking its time to absorb and adjust to news that was as shocking as the trade figures,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkum </PERSON>, an equity analyst at <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larkum </PERSON> said little economic or corporate news was expected over the course of the next two weeks and predicted that the FT-SE 100-stock index would remain around its current levels. The only factor that could upset this scenario is if Wall Street pulls lower with any significant momentum, he said. `` The market is bound to stay nervous until we get some more data coming through,'' <PERSON> Larkum </PERSON> said.

 When she's not tending to her sheep or horses, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> is busy running a mail-order food business out of her farm house that ships smoked pheasant and other locally produced foods all over the country. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, who was involved in the anti-war movement in the 1960s and worked as a book designer in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> before moving to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in 1973, started Prairie Gourmet last summer. `` I do n't envision myself as the head of a big corporation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>, whose business is located near <LOCATION> Ortonville </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` I just want it to be a stable business that offers employment to ... people in the area.'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was raised in <LOCATION> Meriden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, but said she's found her niche in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` This is my way of counting. Very quietly I can make a difference by the jobs for women, by responsible agriculture,'' said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, who lives in a comfortably cluttered farm house surrounded by farm fields. `` In my own small way, I've come full circle. Rather than thinking that I have to go out and protest, I've chosen to come back to the country and work.'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said she decided to start her own company following a divorce and after hearing an inspirational speech by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>'s talk was about how he was trying to turn around the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> food economy by not shipping all of their produce out to be processed, but instead doing it in state. His talk was the basis for my doing something like that,'' she said. Prairie Gourmet ships fresh and smoked pheasant, wild rice, smoked sausage and lutefisk and lefsa as well as other foods, including desserts. All of the foods are produced in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. For example, she buys her wild rice from the <LOCATION> Leech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Band </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION>; most of the pheasants are supplied by the Pomme de Terre Game Farm in <LOCATION> Morris </LOCATION>; and area families sell <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> the duck, wild turkeys and mallards. <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> employs two local residents part-time during the summer and about eight during the holiday season to help with packing and shipping. She called the business so far `` extremely successful'' and said she had sales of $ 10,000 her first season. `` For the fact that I just got the business going last year, I was just thrilled,'' said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, who got started with a $ 5,000 loan for computer equipment from the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> revolving loan fund. It's important for lenders to support rural residents trying to start new companies, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` I want other counties ... to understand that they have to take risks sometimes, especially with women who are just trying to get things going,'' she said. `` We're desperate in many situations, but with a little help and a little confidence shown in us, we're able to get some things off the ground.'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said she's now working on setting up a cooperative cannery where rural residents can sell jams and jellies. `` In their own gardens, they can raise a lot of these products. I'd like ownership to be spread to different men and women within the community, and for them to be responsible for it,'' said <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. Being a single woman was not a disadvantage in starting Prairie Gourmet, she said. `` The only problems I've run into have been because of the lack of my own experience,'' she said. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said she plans to meet informally with women this fall to talk to them about starting their own companies. `` They just need to hear from another woman and talk to someone else to say, ` Yes, you can do it. I know you're scared, I know you do n't see how in the world you're going to pull this together.' It's amazing how much confidence you can give someone else,'' she said.

<HEAD>Watch Your Economic Assumptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Watch your economic assumptions! This warning could be offered at any time of the year and at any point in the economic cycle, but it is especially relevant now. The reason: If your assumptions are wrong, your conclusions could be terribly wrong. An example of the problem is now circulating in the popular media, to wit, that rising interest rates make it almost inevitable that a consumer-sector recession will develop. The assumption is that rising rates on variable home mortgage loans and other variable-rate instruments, will cost the consumer so much that little will be left for the purchase of goods and services. True, rising rates could force many consumers into awkward and even destructive financial situations, but many others might benefit. In fact, it is likely that more money _ not less _ might be put into the hands of consumers. The conclusion that higher rates could ruin the consumer economy is based largely on the assumption that there are more debts than assets. Not so, says <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinemann </PERSON>, chief economist of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Ladenburg </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thalmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. He observes that the reverse is true, explaining: `` Data compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> show plainly that during periods of rising rates, consumer interest income goes up more than consumer interest payments. `` The reason for this is simple: Overall, American consumers are enormous net creditors _ their financial assets exceed their debts by at least $ 4 trillion, a margin of more than 2 to 1.'' Another error of assumption might entrap those who argue that the economy faces a downturn for the simple reason that the economic expansion, now in its 69th month, is due for a fall. It is too old, they say. Maybe so, maybe not. Some economists are n't convinced that the economy has been on a steady roll for nearly seven years. They concede that the official figures indicate an uninterrupted expansion; but they wonder if the figures are correct. Some of the questioning arises from data supplied by <ORGANIZATION> Sindlinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, research firm that obtains its information from intensive telephone interviews with a cross-section of households. The key to the consumer economy, says <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>, is what he calls `` Household Liquidity,'' or a continuing measurement of the financial ability of households. That, he says, is the engine of the economy. `` By our calculations based on Household Liquidity, the current economic recovery is about 20 months old,'' says <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON>. Household Liquidity, he says, bottomed out in November 1986. At the time, he listed 31 states in recession. He contends this was a genuine recession, a bona fide interruption of the economic expansion, but that it was obscured from national figures by unusually strong economic activity on the East and West coasts. <PERSON> Sindlinger </PERSON> measures only a few states remaining in recession now, but asserts that if that was n't a recession we went through two years ago then an unidentified monster was plodding through the economic woods. Another incorrect assumption trapped some of the haughtiest economic minds last October, when so many of them stated flatly that a securities market collapse of such great magnitude would lead inevitably to recession. Some will continue to argue that in spite of a strong economy the verdict is n't in yet _ that a recession still lies ahead _ but they are n't likely to get much of a hearing. A recession could be in the offing, since recessions are always in the offing; some economists would have nothing to say if that threat was n't there to talk about. But linking the next recession to the securities market collapse is getting more difficult by the day. The collapse might indeed by a contributant to that recession, but it will be difficult to cite it as the trigger, or chief factor.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday it will lend debtor governments more money if they are hit unexpectedly by higher interest on their old debts. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, the fund's sister organization, estimates Third World debt will reach more than $ 1.2 trillion at the end of this year. Much of that was lent at interest rates that vary every day, so when rates go up, the outflow of money from the borrower country grows heavier. For example, if a country has borrowed $ 50 billion at a variable rate, it has to pay out an extra $ 500 million a year whenever the annual rate goes up by one percentage point. The fund calls its new system the Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility. If the borrowing country accepts the fund's conditions, it will be able to borrow up to 35 percent of its contribution to the fund, called its quota <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the country now in the most acute financial trouble, would qualify to borrow another $ 504 million if it could make an agreement with the fund. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has not been able to borrow from the fund recently because it has failed to get its government deficit down to the promised level. The fund and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> are owned by 151 governments, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holding the largest block of votes. `` For a purchase -LRB- loan -RRB- to take to take place, the member's -LRB- economic -RRB- performance under the associated arrangement -LRB- loan agreement -RRB- from the fund must be satisfactory and the member must be prepared to adapt its ... policies if necessary ...,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> announcement said The fund typically makes its loans by installment. When a borrower is found not to be performing satisfactorily, the next installment is not disbursed. Often commercial banks also stop disbursements when the fund does. This has occurred with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Americans' personal incomes, bolstered by the biggest increase in wages in seven months, rose 0.6 percent in July while consumer spending slowed because of a drop in auto sales, the government reported Friday. The 0.6 percent increase in incomes was identical to the June advance and would have been an even stronger 0.8 percent if it had not been for a big drop in farm subsidy payments. Spending on personal consumption, which includes virtually everything except interest payments on debt, rose a 0.5 percent in July. While this was less than half the 1.1 percent June advance, economists said it showed that overall demand remained strong despite a decline in car purchases. As with other recent statistics, economists found signs of growing inflationary pressures in the report, primarily in a 1 percent gain in wages and salaries, the biggest rise in this key income component since last December. While rising incomes are normally viewed as healthy, economists have begun worrying that demand pressures are outstripping the economy's ability to produce goods, thus creating a classic recipe for rising inflation. Those fears were heightened Thursday when the government reported that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, was growing at a 3.3 percent annual rate from April through June, faster than previously believed, while a GNP price index shot up at the fastest rate in six years. `` We have a lot of economic activity out there and it is generating a lot of jobs and spending power for American consumers,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. She said that for the first time since the late 1970s, consumers appeared to be basing purchases on a belief that they needed to act before prices went higher. `` Up until recently, we have had enormous resistance to price increases, but I think we are beginning to see a buildup of inflationary expectations,'' she said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a governemnt securities dealer, said the personal income report showed that economic growth was showing no signs of slowing down in the July-September quarter, despite efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to dampen demand by pushing interest rates higher. He predicted further credit tightening in the months ahead. `` This is too much of a good thing for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` We are seeing the strength in consumer spending coming on top of an already strong trade sector and stepped-up spending by businesses for plant and equipment. It raises the threat of accelerating inflation.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, called the report `` good news.'' `` The figures in the report are favorable, with steady income growth, good growth in consumer spending and an in the personal saving rate,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The 0.6 percent rise in incomes in both June and July was the best showing since a 1 percent increase last March. Wages and salaries rose $ 24.5 billion in July, compared to an increase of $ 18.9 billion in June, with increases in manufacturing contributing $ 3.8 billion of the increase. The overall increase was offset by a $ 9 billion drop in farm subsidy payments, which are extremely volatile from month to month. Americans' disposable, or after-tax incomes, rose 0.6 percent in July, down only slightly from a 0.7 percent June increase. With incomes rising slightly faster than spending, the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable incomes, edged up to 4.3 percent in July, compared to 4.2 percent in June. The 0.5 percent increase in spending followed a 1.1 percent June advance which had been the largest gain in 10 months. Total spending rose $ 15.7 billion, compared to a huge $ 36.1 billion June advance. The July performance represented slower growth in spending for non-durable goods and services and no change at all in the durable sector because of a drop in auto sales. But analysts noted that car sales have rebounded in August and they predicted further spending gains because of this. The changes left incomes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.07 trillion while personal consumption spending rose to an annual rate of $ 3.24 trillion.

The report on a previously disclosed inquiry concerning <PERSON> Bradt </PERSON> said that he had improperly engaged in discussions on a new business venture with <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, the exchange's former compliance director. The report also criticized <PERSON> Bradt </PERSON> for accepting fees from a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> member firm of the exchange, evidently for his work in helping create an oil-options contract traded there. <PERSON> Bradt </PERSON> announced his resignation Thursday after the commission issued the critical report, considered highly unusual for a government agency that historically has played a minimal supervisory role in the markets. The report stopped short of asserting <PERSON> Bradt </PERSON> had broken any rules, but recomended changes to strengthen the exchange's standards of conduct that would avoid giving the appearance of conflicts of interest In a statement about <PERSON> Bradt </PERSON>'s resignation, the exchange made no mention of the criticism contained in the report, saying only that it had cleared him of allegations of wrongdoing. The exchange said Vice Chairman <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guttman </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Bradt </PERSON>. `` I am pleased with the findings contained in the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> report and that at no time were any Exchange or CFTC rules or regulations violated,'' the statement quoted <PERSON> Bradt </PERSON> as saying. `` However, I believe it is in the best interest of my business, my family and the Exchange, now that I've been vindicated, to step down as chairman.'' The rapidly growing exchange is the world's major crude-oil futures market. It also is an important center for contracts in heating oil, gasoline, propane, platinum and palladium.

<HEAD>Former Western Airlines Customers Eligible for Rebate or Mileage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As many as 265,000 travelers who bought discount fares on the former <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> are eligible to receive credit for up to 7,000 frequent-flier miles under a settlement approved in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> court. Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved the settlement of a class-action lawsuit filed three years ago against <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION>, which has since been acquired by Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit alleged that Western overcharged customers when it levied cancellation or alteration fees ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent of the ticket price. Lawyers <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON> and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, representing the plaintiffs, said Western added transportation taxes onto the basic fare price before computing the penalties, instead of levying the penalties only against the fare price. Eligible fliers are those who changed or canceled the discount tickets on Western flights between Jan. 1, 1985 and April 1, 1987. Under the settlement, which carries a maximum cost to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> of $ 100,000, the airline did not admit any wrongdoing, but agreed to give affected travelers their choice of a $ 4.80 refund, 3,000 more miles on a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> frequent-flier account at any time, or 7,000 additional miles if the traveler uses them by Dec. 31. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said the deadline for rebates, some of which could have been higher with documentation from customers, was Aug. 2, and notices were sent before that to 265,000 people and published in more than 60 newspapers. Claim forms are available from <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, many travel agents and airports, as well as from the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. Western operated mostly in the West, but also served other cities including <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower in light trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in the absence of any news to influence the market, analysts said. `` It was a dull session with further erosion of values,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> grain trading specialist on the exchange floor. <PERSON> George </PERSON> said talk circulated that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the market for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, but he added the item was `` becoming almost a daily rumor'' and had little market impact. Analysts said the corn and soybean markets were gradually shifting their focus from the dry growing season to the harvest, when prices typically move lower,. `` We're starting to see some corn harvest activity in the South and two weeks from now we'll probably see it moving into the Corn Belt,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, a grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's pretty difficult to buy the market when the harvest is just around the corner.'' At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.90 a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.77 a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.54 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents lower to 5 cents higher with September at $ 8.32 a bushel.

<HEAD>Asbestos Claimants Miss Supreme Court Deadline, Manville Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that a group of asbestos claimants had not met a deadline for petitioning the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review the company's Chapter 11 reorganization plan. That means just one appeal must be reviewed by the court before <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> can implement the plan. `` Obviously we're pleased, because it means that we're just one step closer to emerging from Chapter 11 and being able to operate as a normal company again,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Samson </PERSON>. `` It also means we're just one step closer to the point where the -LRB- Personal Injury Settlement -RRB- Trust can be activated and asbestos health claimants can begin to be compensated,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection six years ago, on Aug. 26, 1982, when more than 400 asbestos-related lawsuits were being filed against the company each month. A proposed reorganization plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> in December 1986, but it can not be consummated until all appeals are exhausted. The plan created the personal injury trust as well as a <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Damage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> to settle asbestos-related claims. It also devised a schedule for paying secured and unsecured creditors. A group of about 700 asbestos health claimants had challenged parts of the plan that prevent payment of punitive damages to asbestos claimants and that require lawsuits for asbestos injuries to be filed against the <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> rather than <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. The appeal was turned down by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bankruptcy court, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> officials said the group failed to petition the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a review of the plan by the deadline at midnight Thursday. Earlier this summer, <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MacArthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Minneapolis-based building materials distributor, petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a review of the bankruptcy court's approval of more than $ 700 million in settlements negotiated between <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> and 29 insurance carriers. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has not acted yet on MacArthur's petition.

 Stock prices posted a small gain today in one of the slowest sessions of the year, taking some inspiration from a small decline in interest rates. Worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to push interest rates higher have weighed on the market. On Thursday, the government revised upward its earlier estimates of both economic growth and inflation in the second quarter. But today, the government reported personal income rose by 0.6 percent in July, a bit below expectations, while personal spending rose 0.5 percent. Analysts said today's report calmed worries that inflationary pressures were continuing to build. Stocks were supported by a mild rally in the bond market. Yields on the closely-watched 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond, for instance, fell to 9.42 percent from 9.45 percent late Thursday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a defense contractor, has agreed to pay $ 430,000 to settle claims that the company overbilled the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said the charges against the <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, company stemmed from claims filed in 1983. The government claimed <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>'s aerospace division in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, improperly charged costs directly related to its unsuccessful effort to win a major <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contract for the light assault vehicle. The costs were charged to an indirect account that was partially reimbursed by the government. The government also claimed that in 1983 the company changed the account numbers from certain independent research and development efforts to an account that was partially reimbursed by the government. A company spokesman who asked not to be named confirmed the $ 430,000 settlement but added that the corporation `` believes it did nothing wrong and specifically disputes the validity of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claim.''

<HEAD>Stock Trading Slows to Lowest Level Since Thanksgiving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One day after the anniversary of the stock market's highest point in history, trading slowed to a trickle Friday, with business on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> falling to its lowest level in nine months. `` I looked at my calendar and thought it was a holiday,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON>, manager of retail sales at the Chicago-based investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Rodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I just think a lot of people are finding an excuse to take vacations or an early Labor Day,'' he said. `` There's no question that people are just sitting on the sidelines.'' <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 89.24 million shares. That is the first time volume has fallen below 100 million shares this year and is the lowest since an 86.36 million share day last Nov. 27, the day after Thanksgiving. Other measurements of the market's performance were considered equally uninspiring, traders said. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.58 to 2,017.43. For the week, it rose 1.43 points. By contrast, on Aug. 25, 1987, the Dow average hit a record high level of 2,722.42 and <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 213.48 million shares. It was from that point on that the market began a nervous decline that led to the historic Oct. 19 crash, when the Dow average lost 508 points. Traders generally have blamed the stock market's performance of late on an underlying post-crash investor apathy and concern about rising interest rates.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, But Sentiment Still Bullish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The central banks appear to have won the latest round in their bout to subdue the dollar, which finished lower Friday against several key foreign currencies. But just how long the victory will last remains in question, as bullish sentiment surrounding the dollar still lingers. Traders spent the day assessing a round of interest rate hikes that began Thursday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and were mimicked by a number of European countries. The West German mark continued to draw broad strength from the rate hike as well as from a statement by <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehl </PERSON>, who said the central bank would do everything to prevent the mark from weakening. Although the dollar moved lower against the mark and several other major currencies, analysts said there is an underlying favorable sentiment toward the dollar that simply wo n't go away. `` People have been buying dollars recently on the basis of interest rate increases to come,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have been somewhat restrained in selling dollars because of the view that -LRB- the dollar -RRB- will be going up later,'' he said. Higher interest rates increase the attractiveness of dollar-denominated securities. While many analysts say <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates are taking a breather now, they are looking for further upward moves after November's presidential election. `` That will stop the dollar from falling,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, Mass.-based consulting firm. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which surprised the financial markets earlier this month by hiking its key lending rate, is more concerned about keeping the economy from overheating than manipulating the level of the dollar, he noted. Still, keeping the dollar in a reasonable range, partly so that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit continues to decline, requires some skilled juggling. A dollar that is too high makes foreign goods cheaper, whetting <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers' appetite for imports. `` And you can not solve that by raising interest rates overseas because that slows down other economies, and they're going to import fewer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the much-touted rise in the dollar, analysts agree that its climb has been pretty much confined to the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies, with the exception of the British pound. Based on Thursday's closing rates, the dollar was up 2.7 percent against the mark from year-ago levels, <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> said, but it was off 6.1 percent against the Japanese yen and 4.2 percent against the British pound. `` The huge Japanese segment of the market is quiet, and that suggests we've come off in part because people recognize there is n't enough momentum at this stage,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> said. `` The central banks have won this round, but it may not last very long.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell to a closing 133.50 yen from Thursday's 133.76 Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 133.65 yen. And in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar closed at 133.78 yen, up from 133.44 yen on Thursday. Thursday's report that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade deficit swelled to 2.15 billion pounds in July from 1 billion pounds in the previous month continued to pummel the pound. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it cost $ 1.6910 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6995 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.6870 to buy one pound, cheaper than Thursday's $ 1.6965. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.8573 West German marks, down from 1.8657; 1.5681 Swiss francs, down from 1.5705; 6.3065 French francs, down from 6.3413; 1,382.00 Italian lire, down from 1,385.00, and 1.2392 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2360. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.8565 West German marks, down from 1.8630; 1.5655 Swiss francs, down from 1.5715; 6.3010 French francs, up from 6.2375; 2.0970 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1030; 1,380.50 Italian lire, down from 1,384.13, and 1.23725 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2342. Gold prices eased. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 432 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 432.60 on Thursday. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery slipped to $ 432.10 a troy ounce, from Thursday's $ 432.80 Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 431.40 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 433.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 432, compared with $ 433.50 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Postponements Delay Griffin's Deal For Resorts International</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Resorts International adjourned a special stockholders meeting on Friday because not enough votes were cast to approve entertainer <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s offer to acquire the gaming and real estate company. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> also ran into a stumbling block at a meeting of the state <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which postponed a vote on a proposed trust agreement <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> must have approved to take over Resorts from developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> plans to purchase <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s controlling Class B stock for $ 135 a share and has made a tender offer for all of the company's Class A stock at $ 36 a share He wants to acquire the Class A and Class B stock of Resorts for about $ 300 million and will pay Trump $ 60 million to terminate his lucrative management contract with Resorts. After that, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will pay <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> $ 255 million to purchase the 1,250-room Taj Mahal casino complex, which is under construction next door to Resorts. The entire deal is contingent on state approval of the trust agreement and interim authorization for <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> to operate the casino. Friday's procedural snags left some people unhappy, namely stockholders who had traveled a distance to attend the meeting at Resorts in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The meeting was rescheduled for 3 p.m. Tuesday. In explaining why the stockholders meeting would have to be adjourned, Resorts President I.G. `` Jack'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> erroneously reported the meeting would be held Sept. 13, so an insufficient number of votes were cast. When <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> adjourned the meeting immediately after opening it, several people among the 100 or so stockholders present protested loudly and demanded at least an update. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, however, calmly stated, `` I've been advised by our legal counsel that it is inappropriate and perhaps even counter to regulations that I discuss anything relating to the merger.'' He added that he would answer questions privately after the meeting adjourned. Once he left the podium, he was immediately surrounded by stockholders and offered his apologies. `` We have about 2 million proxies and we need about 2.8 million,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> is n't going to buy the stock until the shareholders have voted on the merger.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> delayed a vote on <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s proposed trust agreement because commissioners could not agree whether a simple majority vote of 3-2 or a more rigorous 4-1 vote was required. The panel is scheduled to vote Tuesday. Under the proposed trust agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, solely owned by the former talk show host, would take control of the Resorts stock. The company in turn would be placed under a trust headed by <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Luciani </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino executive now working at the Golden Nugget casino in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The state attorney general's office has opposed that arrangement. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaherty </PERSON> told the commissioners Thursday the stock should be placed directly under control of the trust, rather than <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>'s company. Unable to agree on what form of majority was necessary to approve the trust agreement, the casino commission asked lawyers for both sides to submit briefs. At Tuesday's meeting, they will vote first on the majority question and then on the trust proposal itself, said commission spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kokotajlo </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday ran legal advertisements in the nation's 20 largest newspaper markets, detailing a proposed settlement in a lawsuit involving cars driven with disconnected odometers before being sold as new. The three-column ads would run only one day, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervone </PERSON> said. The ads are addressed to people with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars bought before Oct. 9, 1986 and which were involved in the company's `` Overnight Evaluation Program.'' A proposed settlement of the suit was filed Aug. 19 in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, and must be approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nangle </PERSON>, who has scheduled a hearing for Oct. 11. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay more than $ 16 million to people who bought the cars driven in the program. The No. 3 automaker also said it would provide new cars to consumers who were sold cars damaged and repaired during the program. The company has extended warranties on cars driven but not damaged in the program. The proposed settlement says a consumer taking part in it will be paid a minimum of $ 500. The exact amount depends on how many consumers take part in the settlement. The ad said notices of the settlement have been sent to some consumers, and carries an address where other consumers may send claims to be part of the class. Anyone objecting to the settlement must notify <PERSON> Nangle </PERSON>'s court by Sept. 30, and anyone wanting to remove themselves from the settlement must do so by Oct. 7.

<HEAD>Boeing Falls Nine Months Behind In Navy Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An $ 800 million contract to put new wings on the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s aging A6-E attack jets has fallen nine months behind schedule, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> has confirmed. The new wings, made of graphite and other advanced composite materials, are to extend the life of the airplanes, which went into production in the late 1950s. Approximately half the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' 340 A6-Es have been grounded or restricted because of metal fatigue. An article in this week's Aviation Week & amp; Space Technology, an aerospace industry publication, said the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, Kan.-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary had fallen 41 wings behind schedule. So far, only three wings have been delivered. The magazine reported the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has decided to buy more of the original metal wings from <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as replacements and will restructure the rewinging program. No contract has been signed with <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> to make the additional metal wings. Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> A6-E program manager, told <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> it will take <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> 18 months from any agreement before the first metal wings are delivered. The flight of the first test jet with a composite wing has slipped back to January. The first such aircraft had been scheduled for delivery in October, but will now be delayed until all problems are solved, the magazine said. Vice Adm. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, visited <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> plant in June, then wrote <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> to complain about poor attention to quality control. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is withholding approximately $ 100 million from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> because of the delay, <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials said they think they have solved the problems and are moving toward the planned production rate of six wings per month. `` We had some early start-up problems, some engineering changes, and a delamination problem late last year,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. `` That's all been resolved. More recently, we had some fasteners that were too short. We're inspecting all those, replacing any of those that need to be replaced <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> unit has 1,900 people working on the A6-E wing project and is under contract to produce 174 production wings and five test wings, Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. The first wing, scheduled for delivery last November, was delivered in mid-May. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has said in recent quarterly earnings reports that startup costs and delays in military programs have cut into its profits.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Hit 12-Year Low On Threat To International Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cocoa futures prices plunged to their lowest level in 12 years Friday on reports the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> was considering drastic changes in the funding of its price-support operations. Cocoa for September delivery on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 37 to settle at $ 1,266 per metric ton, the lowest price since late 1976. On other markets, cattle futures advanced while pork futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; precious metals declined; energy futures rose; and stock-index futures were unchanged. The cocoa market, already weakened by large surpluses, was shaken by reports the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> had circulated a memo suggesting producer nations stop paying a levy to the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 1, the beginning of the 1988-89 marketing year. The current <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> agreement requires producers to pay the organization a $ 30 levy for each metric ton of cocoa they sell. The organization of the world's largest cocoa producer and consumer nations uses the money to control world prices by buying and maintaining a buffer stock of surplus cocoa. Producers have fallen $ 68 million behind in their levy payments, with the largest producers _ the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> _ owing $ 48 million and $ 9 million, respectively, according to <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, cocoa market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> secretary's memo to the organization's members suggested the organization should abandon any hopes of collecting the levy payments and devise another way to finance its operations, Ms. <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON> said. `` This proposal is a drastic measure that people had not been expecting,'' she said. `` In effect, this would be the end of the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> pact.'' The secretary suggested, as a financing alternative, that the <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> sell a total of 25,000 metric tons of buffer stock cocoa over the next two marketing years. Such an action would have little impact on prices, Ms. <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON> said, citing the 200,000-ton surplus expected in the 1988-89 year. But the psychological impact of abandoning the current financing agreement would be enormous, she said. Although the producers are not likely to ever pay all they owe, `` by keeping up the pretense of asking them for the levy, it keeps up hope of some negotiated compromise down the road,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> members will discuss the proposal at a two-week meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that begins Sept. 5, she said. Firm demand and expectations of declining supplies boosted cattle futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but the pork complex finished mixed on the belief that larger numbers of hogs would soon be heading to market, analysts said. Live cattle settled .05 cent to .87 cent higher with October at 72.97 cents a pound, a new contract high; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .53 cent higher with September at 82.25 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with October at 41.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .33 cent lower with February at 54.82 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower in light profit-taking on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in the absence of influential news, analysts said. `` It was a dull session with further erosion of values,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> grain trading specialist on the exchange floor. Wheat settled 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 3.90 a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.77 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 2.54 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to 7 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 8.31 -LCB- a bushel Precious metals futures fell modestly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with October at $ 435.60 a troy ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 5.6 cents lower with September at $ 6.66 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices finished higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in sporadic trading, bouncing back from a steep slide the day before. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 3 cents to 6 cents higher with October at $ 15.34 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent to .36 cent higher with September at 42.67 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .15 cent to .50 cent higher with September at 46.79 cents a gallon. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock index settled unchanged at 259.70 points.

<HEAD>Prices End Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices eased and closed little changed Friday after strengthening on news of moderate rises in personal income and spending that diluted fears of acute inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond rose about $ 1 for each $ 1,000 in face amount, and its yield softened to 9.43 percent from 9.45 percent late Thursday. Earlier in the trading session, the 30-year bond was up about $ 5. Bond brokers said the market initially strengthened after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Americans' personal income rose by 0.6 percent in July and personal consumption spending rose 0.5 percent. Department figures showed that two components of inflation, rising wages and surging demand for goods, were not as excessive as many bond investors had anticipated. The bond market is sensitive to inflation because it erodes the value of fixed-income investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report caused short-covering, which means professional traders who had sold borrowed bonds on the assumption that the market would drop because of the new rushed to buy them back. The effect was to raise prices. Nevertheless, bonds eased as the day drew to a close, partly because market professionals were reluctant to go into a weekend with risky positions and decided to take some profits on whatever gains they had made for the week. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments rose about 1-32 point, intermediates rose about -LRB- point and long-term maturities rose about 3-32 point, the financial reporting service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.46 to 1,123.53. In corporate trading, industrials and utilities also strengthened slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.14 to 281.65. Muncipal bonds also were slightly higher or unchanged, brokers said. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 7.57 percent as the discount rose 6 basis points to 7.34 percent. Yields on six-month bills were unchanged at 7.87 percent and the discount stayed at 7.48 percent. Yields on year bills rose to 8.30 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 7.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 8 -LRB- percent, down from 8 \ percent late Thursday

 The stock market posted a slim gain Friday as trading volume withered to its lowest level of the year. Analysts said stocks took some support from a mild runup in bond prices, which sent yields on some fixed-income issues a bit lower. But they said the sluggish trading totals indicated investors continue to play it safe while awaiting a clearer signal on the direction of the economy, inflation and interest rates. `` There have been some very selective areas that have been trying to pull ahead, but there is no conviction. The market has been in this holding pattern for most of this week,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>, technical analyst for <ORGANIZATION> MKI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 15.82 on Thursday, rose 6.58 to 2,017.43. That left the market's best-known index with a gain of 1.43 points for the week. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7-to-6 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 725 issues up, 605 down and 601 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 89.24 million shares, down from 127.64 million in the previous session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index rose 0.30 to 147.24. That was the slowest trading level of 1988 and the lowest since 86.36 million shares were traded on Nov. 27, 1987, the day after Thanksgiving. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 106.96 million shares. Worries that inflation may be accelerating at a pace that would prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to push interest rates higher have weighed on the market. But the government reported Friday that personal income rose by 0.6 percent in July, a bit below expectations, while personal spending rose 0.5 percent. Analysts said the report calmed worries that inflationary pressures were continuing to build. The report sent bond prices mildly higher, reducing their yields slightly. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said relatively high rates on fixed-income securities such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues are giving investors appealing alternatives to stocks. `` No one wants to get out there and be aggressive. They can stay on the sidelines and generate some pretty nice yields without much risk,'' he said. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagle </PERSON>, director of technical research at the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he thinks the slow trading indicates `` a market that seems to feel the worst that can hit us has happened.'' `` This is a very sold out market,'' he said. `` There is so much pessimism and so much cash ... that the chance is for a breakout on the upside.'' Northeast Utilties was the most active issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, rising -LRB- to 18 -RRB-. Friday was the deadline for shareholders to qualify for a quarterly dividend. <ORGANIZATION> Primerica </ORGANIZATION> was up 2 -RRB- at 30 -LRB- on speculation that it may be a takeover target. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 83 ~ The company rejected as inadequate an $ 80-a-share takeover bid from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> and said it may propose a sweetened restructuring plan.

<TEXT>
 A three-year battle over the Seattle-Tokyo air route took another twist Friday as a federal appeals court ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to award the route now held by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to rival <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The decision by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> left <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> joyful, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> silent, and a third contender for the route, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, puzzled. A <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the agency would have no immediate comment. `` The lawyers are studying it and a response will be forthcoming,'' the spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>, said. United spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> responded, `` We will have no comment until we have time to review it.'' Continental President <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> said his airline was `` extremely gratified with the decision. `` The law was on our side, as we maintained all along.'' `` We're clearly disappointed,'' said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` However, at this point, since we were not involved in that particular litigation, there's not a great deal of action we can take that we are aware of. We will look more closely at the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to see if, in fact, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has any options at this point. `` It's difficult for us to see how <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> would be a carrier that would help strengthen national interests as it regards service to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and transpacific service in general.'' <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> have been vying for the Seattle-Tokyo run and at various times each has been recommended by administrative law judges or senior DOT officials to fly the route. This summer alone, an administrative law judge recommended that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> be awarded the route, a top <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> official subsequently recommended it go to American, and a <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary then said further study was needed. The appeals court, in a highly technical order, ruled DOT violated administrative procedures when in June 1987 it decided to begin again the process of selecting an airline rather than making a final decision. At that time, an administrative law judge recommended <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> be awarded the route, but a senior <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> official disagreed, recommending <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> retain it. In Friday's ruling, the appellate court said, `` <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> had a statutory right to a prompt decision on the merits of their applications -LRB- for the route -RRB- and the Department can not escape this obligation. ...'' The court said the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> had had 90 days to either accept the administrative law judge's recommendation or come up with its own decision on who should fly the route. Starting the proceedings over was not acceptable, the court said. The court ordered that DOT recommend to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> receive the route. <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would review the recommendation for `` foreign policy or national defense'' implications but approval was usually pro-forma. All three airlines had engaged in a heated competition for the route. United President <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said at a hearing it would be unfair for the department to strip his airline of the route after it had spent years trying to acquire it and had sunk millions of dollars into developing it at a time when it was just becoming profitable. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> had previously warned it would have to cancel its <LOCATION> Seattle-Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> run if it lost the route and transfer many of its 2,500 employees workers based at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. American President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> testified that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, which already flies between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, wanted to retain the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> route to block other airlines from gaining a foothold in <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> markets. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said his airline was prepared to slash fares to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> if it received the route, including one-way Seattle-Tokyo fares, as low as $ 299.
