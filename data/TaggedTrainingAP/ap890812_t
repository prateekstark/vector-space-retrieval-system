<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazouri </PERSON>, at the controls of a crane wielding a wrecking ball, officially marked the end of 36 years of toll bridges in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> by helping demolish several toll booths. After collecting some $ 370 million in tolls from 1.5 billion motorists, the tolls were removed Friday from four local bridges and a four-lane expressway. `` We have taken a quantum leap forward in improving the quality of life for our city. Today is like New Year's, Christmas and the Fourth of July rolled into one,'' <PERSON> Hazouri </PERSON> said at ceremonies at the <LOCATION> Mathews </LOCATION> bridge, which opened in 1953. Moments earlier signs were unveiled on the <LOCATION> Mathews </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> toll plazas reading, `` No Tolls, Pass Thru.'' At the same time, the tolls also ended on the <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Trout </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> bridges and on <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, a four-lane expressway linking <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 95 </ORGANIZATION> to the beach. There was a festive party atmosphere on the <LOCATION> Mathews </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, with crowds cheering, horns honking and the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Band </LOCATION> playing. Fireworks were ignited on Quarantine Island in the middle of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The mayor and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Jacksonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, climbed aboard a large yellow crane, and with the help of a crane operator, toppled several toll booths. In a large front-page headline, The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> proclaimed Friday, `` Un-tolled joy: KEEP THE CHANGE.'' The removal of the tolls was made possible by the passage in March 1988 of a half-cent city sales tax. In addition to removing tolls on existing bridges, the new <LOCATION> Dames </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> opened toll-free earlier this year. The removal of the tolls cames 18 months after the voters approved the concept. The wait was necessary to convince state officials that the sales tax revenue would generate sufficient funds to cover the refinancing of $ 200 million in outstanding toll-revenue bonds issued in 1963, 1977 and 1985.

<TEXT>
 The 13th day of jury deliberations in the `` Night Stalker'' trial was interrupted Friday when the judge dismissed a juror for sleeping and ordered the panel to start all over again. An alternate juror was chosen to replace the sleeping juror in the complex case involving 13 murders and 30 felonies committed during the summer of l985. Jurors heard six months of testimony after six months of jury selection. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a 29-year-old drifter from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is accused of being the devil-worshipping `` Night Stalker'' who raped, murdered and robbed victims in a rampage that terrified <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said he and defense lawyer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> were summoned Friday to the courtroom of <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> after the jury foreman sent a note saying that one juror had been seen sleeping at the deliberation table. <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> interviewed the foreman who said two other jurors had reported seeing the man in question nodding off and snoring in the deliberation room. After a brief discussion with attorneys, <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> summoned the juror and told him he was being dismissed for sleeping. The juror did not protest. The judge then brought the entire panel into the courtroom. He told them not to speculate on why the juror was being dismissed and instructed them to begin their talks anew with the alternate filling the dismissed juror's place. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said it was impossible to tell how long it would take now for the jury to reach a unanimous decision on the 43 counts involved. Earlier this week, the jury returned to the courtroom to ask for a repeat of testimony involving <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>' dental problems. It was the first time they had asked for testimony to be read back since they began deliberating July 26.

 A suspected crack dealer curious about a police round-up called a 911 emergency number to ask if authorities were looking for him. When he hung up, he had his answer _ officers were at his door. Police said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Forrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> telephoned the police emergency line on Thursday night to ask about a report he heard on the street _ a grand jury had indicted 101 people suspected of dealing crack and police were looking for them. A computerized system flashed the address from which <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> was telephoning, and officers sped to the house and arrested him, a sheriff's office spokesman said. The indictments were issued Thursday, and by Friday afternoon officers had arrested more than 50 people accused of selling crack to undercover agents working with the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. District Attorney <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said arraignments would be held Aug. 25. The investigation began early this year, authorities said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House, sifting through offers, hints and statements from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> about American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to `` let these issues play out for a few days and see what happens.'' `` We get a lot of different statements, some optimistic, some pessimistic, some critical, some crazy,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We watch them all, analyze them all and in a sense, the public and -LRB- the press -RRB- all are seeing the process pretty much as it is.'' The latest development was a conditional offer of assistance from the spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem factions holding most of the 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, during a Friday prayer service in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said he was ready to help free the hostages if the West helps release Arab prisoners in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, using identical language at separate briefings, called it `` an interesting statement.'' `` They should release the hostages,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` You do n't need to talk about it. Just release the people who are held against their will by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. Any help which any party can provide in the unconditional, safe and immediate release of the hostages is welcome.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration has not had any direct contact with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and is n't seeking any. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> reiterated the administration position that it was willing to talk with anyone. Elaborating on his answer, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We always said we'd talk to anybody and seek any avenue for getting the release of the hostages, but there's never really been an opportunity for direct discussions'' with the hostage holders `` Partly they have n't wanted to. We've said we wo n't negotiate for hostages. It just has n't been fruitful.'' An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed skepticism about <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s offer. `` This is the kind of thing we've seen him say on frequent occasions, and he's never done anything,'' the official said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, describing that state of play after two weeks of intense activity, said, `` It's a long process and we need to be patient and let discussions flow back and forth.'' He said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a sense of urgency on `` the overall situation, but the most important traits right now are patience and determination, to not let urgency push you to say things or do things that would be counterproductive.'' Insisting there were no new developments, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We would like to lower our voices a little and let these issues play out for a few days and see what happens.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also played down the prospect of direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after saying a day earlier that the administration expected there would eventually be talks with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on the hostages and communications through third parties. `` The whole question of direct contacts has gotten so far out of proportion that I do n't want to lend any credence to it,'' he said. `` We are having any number of contacts through any number of channels ... but this direct-contacts business, I'm afraid, has gotten you off track in terms of focusing on what's really happening there,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` There's no miracle there -LRB- in direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB-. It's not that big a deal. There's all kinds of contacts that can and will be made _ that have to be made preparatory to direct -LRB- talks -RRB-, and there need never be direct contacts to solve many of these issues, to change relationships and so forth.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had sent messages to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and Palestinian groups urgently appealing for release of the Western hostages. `` The Soviet response has been constructive, helpful and forthcoming,'' the newspaper quoted an administration official. `` It's less than we would like them to do, but more than they would have done in the past.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Says Disclosure Hurt Bloch Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is hardening its assessment of the damage done by public disclosure to its investigation of suspected <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said flatly Friday that the July 21 disclosure that the 54-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat was under investigation had compromised the investigation. `` There is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case, the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation, did compromise the investigation,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. He did n't explain how the investigation had been compromised. However, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>'s assessment was much stronger than one he delivered July 31 when asked about the impact of unprecedented publicity on an espionage investigation that so far has produced no criminal charges. He said then that `` the premature disclosure may have had an adverse impact on the development of new evidence in the case.'' The investigation of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the No. 2 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for much of the decade, was disclosed July 21 by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` The differences in the statements reflects a different view, based on how people in the department see the situation today,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said Friday when asked about the contrast between his two assessments. He acknowledged the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opposed the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to issue a statement after the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> broadcast that essentially confirmed the accuracy of the report. The television report and a series of disclosures have produced what <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> called `` the circus going on out there'' of reporters and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents tailing <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> each day on daily excursions from his apartment. On Thursday, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> acknowledged the department does n't have an espionage case against <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who was placed on paid leave by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Asked why there were no charges despite continuous <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said: `` The department does not bring charges unless it believes it has sufficient evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is guilty of violating the law.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has been conducting a round-the-clock surveillance of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> to prevent him from leaving the country while investigators try to find evidence to charge him with espionage. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> refused to comment when asked if the department had evidence that it was unwilling to disclose in court for fear of hurting counterintelligence operations. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, meantime, led reporters and photographers on a Friday afternoon shopping excursion to a suburban supermarket. About 1 p.m., <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> announced he was about to leave his apartment. Two hours later, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> finally emerged, driving his light-blue <ORGANIZATION> Mercedez-Benz </ORGANIZATION>. He invited two television crews to ride along while he went on errands. Followed by a 20-car caravan of reporters, TV crews and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> drove to a shopping center in nearby <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, where he shopped at a supermarket and a bookstore. The supermarket manager asked the TV crews to leave the store after a cameraman who was backpeddling to film <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> buying groceries knocked over an elderly woman, who cut her hand on the floor.

The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> transit authority and police unions have said they oppose a Guardian Angel patrol. `` We are completely opposed to those who act as a militia or other police force,'' said a statement issued Monday by the transit authority. Ms. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said she had since met with police and transit authority officials and, while not getting their approval, plans to go ahead with setting up a subway patrol. `` We are not a militia,'' she said.

<HEAD>North Sentence Could Have Been Harsher Under Federal Guidelines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A legal publication says <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> could have been sentenced to more than 4 -LCB- years in prison if federal sentencing guidelines had been applied to his Iran-Contra conviction. However, the guidelines that recommend ranges of possible sentences to judges were n't applied in the North case because they cover only federal crimes committed after Nov. 1, 1987. The editors of the Federal Sentencing Reporter, a non-profit publication circulated among federal judges, probation officers, law professors and lawyers, concluded <PERSON> North </PERSON> could have been sentenced under the guidelines to 21 to 57 months in prison. North was convicted of aiding and abetting obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, destroying government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity while working at the White House in 1986. He was fined, put on probation and ordered to do community service _ but was sentenced to no jail time. North began his community service work this week. The ranges `` sketch possible avenues guideline sentencing might have taken,'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Freed of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said in their analysis. If <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s had been a guidelines case, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> still could have imposed no jail time but prosecutors would have been able to appeal. Under the guidelines, `` there is a degree of flexibility, but the challenge for the judge is to persuasively explain why there is a substantial departure,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Friday in an interview. `` When the appeals courts find the explanations unpersuasive, they've reversed sentences.'' The length of a recommended sentence under the guidelines in the North case would depend partly on a judge deciding whether the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide substantially interfered with the administration of justice. Other factors would be the value assigned to classified documents that <PERSON> North </PERSON> destroyed, whether he was a major or minor participant in the crime of aiding the obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and whether he was considered to be in a high-level decision-making capacity.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, saying <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear power plant is `` safe, efficient and much-needed,'' is joining in a lawsuit to prevent the plant from being dismantled The intervention in a state court came on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which has strongly opposed the shutdown of the 813-megawatt plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, deputy energy secretary, said the state, in its approval of the dismantling plan, had not adequately considered the impact on the environment. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argues that the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> should have prepared formal environmental impact statements before approving the plan. The plant, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said, is `` safe, efficient and much-needed,'' adding that its closure would require the region to rely more heavily on fossil fuel. Those fuels, he said, will have `` adverse environmental consequences'' through the increased release of chemicals that contribute to acid rain and global warming. Some <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents and a group called Scientists and <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secure </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> filed the suit against the plant. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration previously has made clear its opposition to the closing of the $ 5.5 billion plant completed in 1985 and licensed last year. It has yet to produce any commercial electricity. State and local officials contend the plant should not be allowed to operate because evacuation of the area 50 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> would be impossible. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> plans to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> next week to discuss White House opposition to the plant being torn down.

The Posner tract, the city's only undeveloped oceanfront land, is wedged between a strip of high-rises and would have made a perfect setting for a park, state officials said. But <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> thought the swap would not have been profitable for him, said his attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> land, formerly owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, is worth $ 8 million while <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>'s land is worth $ 15 million, state officials said. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> would proceed with plans to build the condominiums with 1,500 units on the site. <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> faces one more hurdle: state approval for two of the five buildings that would be built near the ocean.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government says that net deposit withdrawals at the nation's thrifts more than doubled in June _ to $ 4.6 billion. The Office of Thrift Supervision, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> until enactment of the new savings and loan law earlier this week, attributed the outflow to intentional shrinkage by thrifts as they prepared to meet the law's tough capital rule. `` Everybody knew about the legislation in June,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> OTS </ORGANIZATION> chief economist, said Friday. `` They knew it was just a matter of time and they were doing the things they will have to do in order to meet higher capital requirements.'' About one in four of the nation's 2,933 S & amp; Ls do n't meet the new standard _ $ 1.50 in tangible capital for every $ 100 in lending _ that becomes effective in four months. The only way thrifts that ca n't attract new capital can comply is to sell off assets such as loans and pay off liabilities such as deposits. <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said S & amp; Ls in June reduced their assets by a near-record $ 7.6 billion, a monthly total exceeded only by the $ 8 billion reduction in January. Most of the June reduction was accounted for by a record $ 5.1 billion drop in mortgage-backed securities, one of the most easily sold assets in a thrift portfolio. The June deposit outflow was the 14th in a row. Although it was more than twice the $ 2.1 billion drain in May, it was still far below the $ 10.8 billion record set in January. For the first six months of the year, a net $ 40.3 billion have flowed out of thrift accounts compared with an inflow of $ 11.8 billion in the first half of 1988.

 Prosecutors want a federal appeals court to reconsider its decision to overturn the illegal lobbying conviction against former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> panel `` undermined critical provisions of the Ethics in Government Act'' when it ruled June 27 that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s conviction must be set aside, prosecutors said in court papers filed Friday. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> asked the court to grant a rehearing before the three-member panel or set the case for rehearing by all 10 members of the appeals court. <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> was convicted Feb. 11, 1988, on three counts of lobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients shortly after he left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. Prosecutors say the lobbying violated a one-year ethics law ban against lobbying former government colleagues. But the appeals panel, in a 2-1 ruling, said that to get a conviction, prosecutors were required to show that <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> knew he was lobbying his former colleagues on matters in which the White House had a `` direct and substantial interest.'' Prosecutors maintain the law required only that they show <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> intended to influence the officials on those matters. One of <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, said the prosecution arguments present `` absolutely nothing new'' and there is `` no reason to disturb'' the appeals court decision.

 Two abortion protesters and a man who insisted <PERSON> God </PERSON> told him to set fire to an abortion clinic conspired to violate federal racketeering laws, a federal court jury ruled Friday in a civil lawsuit. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON>, already serving 20 years in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> federal prison for setting fire to the Feminist Women's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, also violated the racketeering statute through arson and extortion aimed at the abortion clinic, the jury concluded. The Everett clinic was burned three times between December 1983 and April 1984, then closed its doors. <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON> earlier told the jury he had no intention of setting any fire until he heard God tell him to do it. He and protesters <PERSON> Dottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Codispoti </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stevens </LOCATION>, were found to have conspired to violate the racketeering statute. <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON> was ordered to pay $ 268,500 in civil damages while <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Codispoti </PERSON> will share another $ 11,000 fine. All damages can be trebled. Two other defendants, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Undseth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION>, were acquitted. Jurors in Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON>'s court deliberated 3 -LCB- days before reaching a verdict in the month-long trial. The lawsuit is only the second time the racketeering statute, intended to fight organized crime, has been used against abortion protesters. Damages will go to several clinic employees and to the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yakima </ORGANIZATION>, parent clinic to the one that burned. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>' lawyer <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrempp </PERSON> promised an appeal. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, holding her young grandson <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON>, said she thinks the jury was confused by the complexity of the case, involving 52 pages of jury instructions. `` It's a perversion of the First Amendment,'' she said. `` This one's going to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' She said the plaintiffs `` wo n't get anything out of me ... because I do n't have anything. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the case that set precedent in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> case was upheld on appeal in March and defendants have asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear it. Twenty-six individuals were found guilty of multiple acts of extortion at an abortion clinic there. The clinic was awarded $ 100,000. Lawyers for the plaintiffs alleged <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON> and the other defendants conspired to shut down the clinic by arson, personal and telephone harassment of patients and staff, blocking access to and from the clinic, picketing and helping <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON> escape to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. A successful action under the racketeering statute must show an enterprise adversely affects interstate commerce and engages in a pattern of racketeering, meaning a serious violation of the law such as arson, extortion, wire fraud, robbery, kidnapping or murder, said <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiryak </PERSON>, the civil rights attorney who tried the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> case.

<HEAD>Peugeot Shows Worst Injury Potential In Government Crash Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Crash tests indicate that a driver of a <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> 505S has a greater chance of head injury than drivers of 28 other cars and small trucks tested so far, federal engineers say. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the tests conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> using instrument-equipped dummies do n't accurately test the effects of real highway accidents. `` Our top concern is protecting human beings, not dummies,'' <PERSON> Pascal </PERSON> <PERSON> Henault </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. The new series of tests included 10 different car and van models by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign automaker. In previous tests involving 19 vehicles, the Chevrolet Astro Van fared worst. The Astro now stands second among cars tested for injuries in a 35-mile-per-hour collision. The vehicles were tested under <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s program to provide consumers a guide to the safety of 1989 cars and small trucks. The car in which the lightest injury potential was recorded so far is the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION>, followed by the Ford Thunderbird and the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 80. The <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> was among the 10 cars tested in the most recent round. Others, in addition to the Peugeot 505S, were <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonata </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> Trooper II, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidekick </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Toyota </PERSON> <PERSON> Cressida </PERSON>, Corolla, pickup and van. After the latest tests were made public, <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> issued a news release including comments from <PERSON> Henault </PERSON> and from four automotive and consumer experts who criticized the government tests as inaccurate measures of the varied circumstances that exist in real crashes. `` <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to building cars that are safe in the real world can not be overshadowed by these experimental crash-test results,'' said <PERSON> Henault </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> tests consist of crashing a single model of each car containing two crash dummies into a fixed barrier at 35 mph. The stresses that result on the dummies are measured by sensors. The artificial occupants are protected by seat belts and other safety devices used in the cars. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> engineers reported stresses on the head as an index called the `` head injury criterion.'' The higher the index, the greater the likelihood of injury. The Peugeot crash produced a head injury criterion of 1,983 on the driver-side dummy. The earlier Astro test registered 1,849. Federal regulations require cars to produce a head injury criterion no greater than 1,000 in tests conducted by the automakers at 30 mph. The <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> tests are not considered comparable because they are done at a speed 5 mph faster. The tests are continuing, but here is how all models so far tested rank in head injury criterion to the driver: <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> 505S, 1,983; <PERSON> Chevrolet </PERSON> <PERSON> Astro </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON>, 1,849; <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> Pickup, 1,520; <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION>, 1,421; <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sidekick </ORGANIZATION>, 1,345; <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caprice </ORGANIZATION>, 1,328; <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> Trooper II, 1,269; <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION>, 1,183; <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonata </ORGANIZATION>, 1,196; <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corolla </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bronco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> II </ORGANIZATION>, 994; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galant </ORGANIZATION>, 971; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Probe, 970; Jeep Cherokee, 968; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirage </ORGANIZATION>, 960.

Par received approval to market its version June 5 and <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION> was granted approval June 23. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said the approvals were rescinded because the reports on which they were based did n't include `` substantial deficiencies in manufacturing practices'' found during a recent special inspection. The approvals were revoked Aug. 3, <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said. Both companies disputed the legal ground on which <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> issued the revocations. `` The agency just ca n't summarily rescind a new drug approval without providing sponsor due process of law,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeda </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION>. He said the manufacturing problems cited by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> involved `` minor labeling and packaging deficiencies, which the company made prompt corrective action.'' <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION> had not shipped its product when the approval was rescinded, but Par had begun shipping, a spokeswoman said. `` It's not being shipped anymore, but it's not being recalled either,'' said Par lawyer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Manners </PERSON>. She said <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had n't raised any questions about the safety of the product Par and <ORGANIZATION> ATI </ORGANIZATION> are among 11 generic drug companies being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption in the generic drug industry.

<NOTE>No Evidence of Uncontrolled Chain Reaction: DOE</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Energy Department says investigators found no evidence that an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction occurred at the Rocky Flats weapons plant near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. However, the department said Friday that plutonium was found in situations that require `` immediate attention.'' The DOE did not detail those situations or what would be done about them. Plutonium is the nuclear material recovered from weapons being retired and reprocessed at Rocky Flats to make triggers for new weapons. It is highly toxic. The question of a chain reaction arose after radioactive isotopes of strontium and cesium, which do n't occur in nature, were found in groundwater near the plant. Some plant employees claimed that conditions existed routinely that could lead to a chain reaction. An uncontrolled chain reaction produces an explosion in a bomb and a controlled reaction is the basis for nuclear power plants. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and state agencies said the strontium and cesium radioactivity was so low that it was almost undetectable, and might have been the result of fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests of the 1950s and 1960s. Rocky Flats has been criticized for polluting the environment, and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has begun an investigation of past practices.

 Tens of thousands of Poles stopped work for an hour in a Solidarity-organized strike, while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador met with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders and officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spoke against upheaval in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It was the first Soviet government comment on the parliamentary maneuvering in which Solidarity is trying to form a non-Communist government to lead the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc ally.

Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Brovikov </PERSON> held an unusual series of meetings in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Friday, including sessions with the chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

According to the Polish government's <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency, the party leaders and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador met to discuss starting `` direct cooperation'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and to review reforms in both countries. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Brovikov </PERSON> met also with Prime Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who is trying to assemble a Communist-dominated Cabinet. Since neither Solidarity nor the Communists have a majority in parliament, support from the Peasants and Democrats is crucial for both sides' efforts to form a government. A Soviet official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, hinted that Solidarity's attempts to shut the Communists out of a coalition government could hurt stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The unidentified official did not mention Solidarity by name but criticized `` attempts to use the process of forming the Polish government for destabilizing the situation in the country.'' <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> first deputy, was quoted as telling a news conference that any acts that threaten <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s treaty obligations, `` including those under the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> and on Soviet-Polish cooperation, would not promote the interests of stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Forming a new government was <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s affair, <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said, but added that the hoped a `` balanced approach'' would prevail, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The general strike in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> province by bus drivers, shipbuilders, dockhands and factory workers was Solidarity's first since regaining legal status in April. <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Borusewicz </PERSON>, an organizer, described it as `` exceptionally'' successful. Solidarity said more than 200,000 workers participated and many signed up to join the union, which has grown slowly since legalization. `` Even those enterprises where Solidarity is weak went on strike,'' <PERSON> Borusewicz </PERSON> said. Solidarity's regional council for <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> province estimated more than 90 percent of the 500 enterprises in which it had members took part in the strike. Organizers said it encompassed <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sopot </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and inland towns. The province has 1.5 million people. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, addressing workers in <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION>, referred to parliament's election of <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> as prime minister Aug. 2, and said: `` Let's not allow the monopoly of generals to be reborn.'' The opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> said reports were circulating that the opposition was proposing <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> for prime minister. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Madajczyk-Krasowska </PERSON>, a Solidarity spokeswoman, said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made no comment on that report Friday. The strike, announced by wailing sirens and whistles at noon, idled the Northern and Repair shipyards in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Commune shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION> and all ports in both cities, Solidarity said. Buses and streetcars stopped running, and factories displayed banners to show they were participating. Solidarity's birthplace, the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, supported the demands but did not strike. Workers said they did not want to risk upsetting a tentative deal under which American philanthropist <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Piasecka-Johnson </PERSON> would invest in the state-owned yard to save it from bankruptcy. The official trade union federation <ORGANIZATION> OPZZ </ORGANIZATION> said its unions approved of Solidarity's economic demands and it supported the protest.

<TEXT>
 Politics in this working-class city have never been pretty, and it is not surprising this summer's three-way mayoral race has turned downright ugly. Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> has been called `` a six-pack politician.'' State Assemblyman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> was dubbed a `` silk-stocking liberal.'' And, former chief city judge <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> can not shake the tag of being a spoiler. When the candidates are n't calling each other names, they have some choice words for the reporters who cover them. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said Monday that 90 percent of the city's journalists were dishonest and he advised them all to `` mind their own business.'' Things began to turn nasty last week when <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> confirmed he was circulating petitions to qualify himself for an independent line in the Nov. 7 general election. The move was interpreted to mean that even if he lost the Sept. 11 Democratic primary, he would stay in the race. `` Nobody controls me,'' <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> said. Aides to <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON>, who has the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement, blasted <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> for being a spoiler. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a registered Democrat running with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> endorsement for his fourth, four-year term as mayor, has benefited in past campaigns from having the Democratic vote split among two or more challengers. Polls indicate the same thing may happen this year. In an emotional rebuttal of allegations that he was in the race to help keep <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> in office, <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> said, `` No six-pack mayor or silk-stocking liberal is going to defeat -LRB- me -RRB- no matter what they try.'' During a major snow storm that hit <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> in 1985, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> advised residents to stay in their homes and relax with a six-pack of beer. In addition, <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> `` is in bed with <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, a bigot from day one.'' <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> are white; <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> is black. <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON>, in turn, claims that <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> has `` zero chance'' of winning the primary and should get out of the race. If <PERSON> Trammell </PERSON> quit, <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> said his polls show that he would have enough support to beat <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> in a head-to-head matchup either in the primary or the general election. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Hoyt </PERSON> for having paid $ 50,000 to a pollster `` just to tell him he's losing.'' Added the mayor at a news conference, `` I could have told him that.'' The mayor brushed aside reports that except for his monthly news conference, he has avoided both his opponents and the media. The mayor said that if reporters want to cover him on the campaign trail they should follow him around. He admitted he has n't been making his campaign schedule available, but said he might on request

<HEAD>D.C. Offers Money For Tips on Murders</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in 5th graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Informants with tips leading to the arrest of murder suspects will be paid up to $ 10,000 under a program that District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police hope will slow a record homicide rate. Police Chief <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON>, holding his first news conference Friday, said the new reward system is based on an existing program that pays anonymous individuals up to $ 1,000 for information that leads to convictions in robbery, theft and assault cases. At the same time, Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said a new police overtime plan to help slow the pace of killings probably will be scrapped because it is too expensive. <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON> said the more lucrative reward system was needed because many district residents have become intimidated by drug-related violence and were afraid to speak up. `` There is a tolerance of this. What you have to do, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, is get up off your ass, if you'll pardon the expression, and call us,'' said <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON> who, along with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, unveiled a poster with photographs of 18 murder suspects. Later Friday, police discovered one of the suspects is already in the city jail. Police have made arrests in 181 murder cases this year, <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON> said. Through Friday, 274 persons had been killed in the nation's capital this year, compared with 191 at the same time last year In 1988, a record 372 persons were killed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; police blame more than 60 percent of these slayings on drugs. The program is <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON>'s second attempt in a week to slow the city's record homicide rate, which increased sharply several weeks ago. On Monday, <PERSON> Fulwood </PERSON> announced that officers working between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m. _ traditionally the period of highest crime _ will now work until 3 a.m. to help stop the murders. However, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said after the press conference that the new overtime program likely will be abandoned because it costs too much. Police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the new overtime concept will be reviewed next week, and he added that cost will be one of the factors considered.

 To know an Edsel is to love an Edsel, owners of the car say. And to own one is to put up with a lot of jokes. The Edsel, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s great failure of the late 1950s, lives on, though only about 3,500 of them are left on the road. The car has a certain mystique that draws many Edsel owners to gatherings such as the 21st annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edsel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, a four-day affair that ends today. The club, which claims 1,500 members, holds parts auctions, exhibitions and awards banquets at its annual gathering, which also provides a chance for the Edsel owners to get together and talk about their passion _ the car whose name for many is synonymous with failure. `` We're proud of our Edsels,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, who brought his white 1959 model from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, for the meeting. `` We talk about the love and labor we put into them.'' Because of the car's lack of success during its time, jokesters enjoy taking the Edsel and its owners for a ride. `` I think they're jealous,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, an Edsel owner from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> launched the gadgety Edsel on Sept. 4, 1957, with an unprecedented marketing blitz <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> lost about $ 450 million, and the car was discontinued by 1960. But it has since become the stuff of legends. There have been different theories as to why the Edsel bombed. Some say it was a combination of a reaction against the hype, a recession in the auto industry at the time and the car's unusual `` horse collar'' grill. `` I love the design of it now. It was way before its time,'' said <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sica </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who drove his white'59 model to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the meetings provide a chance for Edsel owners to swap or bid to buy parts for their cars. He said his <ORGANIZATION> Edsel </ORGANIZATION> gets him lots of attention, both for its unusual looks and its frequent breakdowns. `` It's embarrassing when they break down, and they do that a lot. But all old cars do that,'' said <PERSON> Sica </PERSON>, an electrician. `` When you break down and pull over on the side of the road, everybody ribs you.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mableton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, who helped organize this year's club meeting, said the scarcity of spare parts is a problem for Edsel owners `` Edsels are difficult to restore,'' he said. `` It's not like a Mustang or a Corvette, where you can buy parts over the counter. Most -LRB- Edsel -RRB- parts were destroyed because <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was so distraught over the failure.'' Many of the Edsel owners say their classics are for special purposes only. They work on them as a hobby and take them out for shows. But <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Daumiller </PERSON> -LRB-'59, yellow -RRB- of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, said his Edsel is his main car. He takes it to the shows but also uses it to go grocery shopping. `` It's a wonderful car,'' he said. `` Kind of stupid and ugly looking, though.''

<TEXT>
 Voyager 2, now 12 days from its close encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, has made another discovery that thrilled scientists: two partial rings of debris orbiting the solar system's fourth-largest planet `` There is a mood of total elation here,'' said astronomer <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. `` We're really just ecstatic. ... Everything we've hoped to look at we're going to get to see.'' Early Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 2 photographed the two partial rings, called `` ring arcs.'' They are arc-shaped belts different from the complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, Uranus and Jupiter. Since early July, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> has discovered four small moons orbiting <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in addition to the previously known moons, Nereid and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. The probe also has discovered 2,700-mile-wide dark bands _ possibly jet stream-like belts of windblown clouds _ forming a collar around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s south pole and possibly its north pole. Voyager 2 earlier revealed a 6,200-mile-wide dark spot in the planet's atmosphere, probably a giant storm like <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s Great Red Spot. Today, Voyager 2, traveling at 42,198 mph, was 2.72 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 11.3 million miles from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, the fourth largest planet of the solar system and eighth planet from the sun. On Aug. 24, Voyager 2 is expected to fly about 3,000 miles above <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s cloudtops. The probe was launched in 1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. One of the two ring arcs detected Friday extends one-eighth of the distance around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s equator, and the other only one-thirty-sixth around the planet. That makes them about 30,000 miles and 6,000 miles long, respectively, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON> said they may prove longer upon closer examination. `` Voyager scientists said the ring arcs may be comprised of debris associated with nearby moons, or may be remnants of moons that have been torn apart or ground down through collisions,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. Scientists do n't yet know if the ring arcs are made up of dust, pebbles or boulders, or if the debris consists primarily of rock or ice, said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> planetary scientist <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who heads the team analyzing photographs taken by the spacecraft. Researchers also do n't know if the two partial rings found by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> are among the three to six ring arcs that scientists previously believed they detected from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but `` it would be surprising if they were n't,'' he added. Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> may discover 50 to 100 partial rings orbiting <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. `` Astronomers have long suspected the existence of ... an irregular ring system around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Voyager's photographs of the rings arcs are the first photographic evidence that such a ring system exists. The three to six previously suspected ring arcs were detected by telescopes on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> passed in front of a distant star. <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>'s extensive rings are made mostly of marble-sized ice pebbles, while Uranus' rings contain very dark boulders of unknown composition, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Jupiter is encircled by a single thin ring and a sheet of fine dust, while <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> has some ring arcs in addition to its rings, <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON> said Why does <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> have partial rather than complete rings? `` That's the $ 64,000 question,'' <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON> said. `` Rings come in a variety of shapes and sizes, all the way from complete disks of material like we've seen at <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, to narrow thin complete ringlets like we've seen at Uranus. ... We believe the gravitational influence of moons that orbit nearby give rings their particular form.'' Voyager 2 detected the 30,000-mile-long arc just outside the orbit of one of the newly discovered moons, designated 1989 N4, which orbits about 23,300 miles above <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. The 6,000-mile long arc seems to trail about 50,000 miles behind moon 1989 N3, which orbits about 17,000 miles above <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s cloudtops, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said.

<BYLINE>Women Run High Depression and Misdiagnosis Risk, Committee Says
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women run about twice the risk of men of becoming depressed, and it is misdiagnosed in them up to half the time, a new report said. Cultural factors are a major reason for the higher incidence, and a tendency of physicians to interpret depressive symptoms as physical illness causes misdiagnosis, said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, head of the group that drafted the report. Findings of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Women and Depression were discussed Friday at the association's annual meeting. The task force examined several studies, which have consistently found that women run twice the risk of depression as men, <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said. The `` average'' woman runs about a 25 percent chance of major depression, and the risk jumps to 51 percent for female physicians and 37 percent for female psychologists, <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said. One reason for the high rates is biology, since women run about a 50 percent chance of mild mood disturbance premenstrually and a 50 percent to 80 percent of mild depression after giving birth, she said. Women who take birth control pills also run a heightened risk of depression, she said. Another reason is what <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> called a surprisingly high incidence of violence against women. Research suggests 37 percent of women have experienced sexual or physical abuse before age 21, and some estimates run higher than 50 percent, she said. Such abuse can lead to prolonged depression in adult women, she said. Women are taught to be passive and dependent, contributing to their depression risk, she said. Calling poverty a `` pathway to depression,'' she said 75 percent of the nation's poor are women and children. Some 71 percent of women have had a significant instance of sexual harassment on the job, she said. Several studies suggest a misdiagnosis rate of 30 percent to 50 percent in women, she said. The problem appears because depressed women often seek help by telling obstetricians, family doctors or internal medicine specialists that they feel poorly or are tired, <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said. The physicians frequently approach it as a medical problem and try to treat it that way, which does not work, she said. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said she did not know how frequently male depressives are misdiagnosed. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheiber </PERSON>, a psychiatry professor at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that a 50 percent misdiagnosis estimate `` sounds high.'' `` Certainly we all know it happens,'' he said, but he knew of no study of rates of misdiagnosing depression. Physicians learn about depression as part of their training, he said. But he also noted that federal mental health officials are encouraging family physicians and specialists to recognize depression in their patients. <PERSON> Scheiber </PERSON> also said the doubled rate of depression for women in comparison to men showed up in a recent study of five communities. While not a nationally representative sample, the work provides the best available estimate of depression rates, he said.

<TEXT>
 Panamanian troops briefly detained American soldiers in another confrontation between both sides, and Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> again indicated he has no intention of stepping down as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leader. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> today marked six years as head of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the nation's de facto ruler. He said Friday that a plebiscite proposed by the opposition for Aug. 20 on whether he should resign was tantamount to turning <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into `` a colony that accepts arrogance, vassalage and indignity.'' He spoke during a parade of thousands of troops and paramilitary civilian units ending a 10-day exercise called `` Zap the Intruder.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` would not rule out'' seizing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and taking him to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to face drug trafficking charges. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not contemplating such a move at this time. The latest confrontation between Panamanian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops occurred in a remote area known as <LOCATION> Curundu </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> says the area is a military zone shared by both countries, while the Panamanians claim it is exclusively their domain. A Defense Forces patrol detained four vehicles carrying a number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military police, and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said it quickly dispatched troops backed by armored cars and helicopters. The incident started when `` American troops went around in civilian clothes, with their weapons, riding in private vehicles in violation'' of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, said Panamanian Maj. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON>. `` No country in the world can accept that units, claiming to be part of an army, move in within its territory armed and in civilian clothes,'' he said. `` If they tried to do this in any other nation they would be killed like common muggers, like a vulgar thief.'' The confrontation ended after a meeting between <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> and American military officers, a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> news release said. The command called the detentions `` unjustified.' `` The vehicles were freed after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officers discussed the situation with officers of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a news release issued by the command. Neither the Panamanians nor the Americans said how many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military police or what kind of vehicles were involved. Similar incidents in recent weeks coincided with <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> exercises and there have been arrests on both sides. Earlier this week, American troops blockaded <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>, which contains <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian military facilities. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials insist they have the right to conduct exercises under the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties to assure canal security. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, however, accuses the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of seeking to abrogate the treaties and keep the canal, which is to be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to pressure <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to quit as head of the military since two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him on drug trafficking and money laundering charges in February 1988. However, tactics that have included economic and trade sanctions have failed to budge <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, the opposition leader who proposed holding the plebiscite on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rule, responded a few hours after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s rejection Friday by calling the leader a dictator <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> also accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of subservience to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We never were and never will be employees of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, while he himself was one,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said in an interview. International observers say the opposition won the May 7 presidential election by a landslide. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime annulled the balloting a few days later, saying there had been vote fraud.

 Suspended <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> said he was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> the day he allegedly left a briefcase in a restaurant for a Soviet agent, but he declined to confirm or deny spying allegations against him. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> spoke in an Austrian television and radio interview broadcast Friday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It was the second time in the past week that he declined opportunities in interviews with Austrian media to deny the suspicions. The Austrian-born diplomat, formerly the No. 2 man in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, was suspended from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on June 22 In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Friday said public disclosure of its investigation of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, 54, had compromised the government's ability to obtain evidence against him. `` There is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case, the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation, did compromise the investigation,'' department spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said without elaboration. No charges have been brought against <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. He remains under investigation and surveillance by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, and reporters have followed him around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in recent days. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has reported that on May 14, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and met his alleged contact for dinner. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> left his briefcase under the table to be picked up by the suspected Soviet agent, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. Asked by Austrian TV correspondent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON> whether he was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> May 14, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> said after a long pause, `` Yes.'' He declined, however, to specify whether he met <PERSON> Reino </PERSON> <PERSON> Gikman </PERSON>, a man holding Finnish documents who regularly visited <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s 1980-87 tour in the Austrian capital. <PERSON> Gikman </PERSON> has been identified by Austrian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities as a suspected <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent who might have been a contact man. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources have said <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> contends he only knew the man as a stamp collector. When <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON> pressed <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> for details of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> trip, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> said, `` I was in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> May 14. I was in a restaurant, and there were very many people in that restaurant, and I enjoyed the food there very much.'' `` Have you missed your briefcase since?'' asked <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON>. After another long pause, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who seemed relaxed and spoke in his native German, said: `` No.'' <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON> repeatedly pressed <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> to deny he was a spy. `` Why do n't you just say it was all just invented?'' he asked. `` I could say much on this topic, but I will restrain myself,'' <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> answered. By remaining silent, <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON> noted, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> only heightens suspense. `` I do n't want people to feel bored during August,'' <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> said, smiling. `` Are the accusations against you justified?'' <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON> asked again several minutes later. `` This question I can not answer now,'' <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> responded. In a much briefer interview in the current issue of the Austrian weekly <ORGANIZATION> Profil </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was similarly elusive. Asked why he did not say straight out he is not a spy, he replied: `` There are accusations, there is no proof. My guilt must be proved.'' <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> first accepted an invitation to visit the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s state-run television 10 days ago, but declined then to be interviewed. <PERSON> Wiesner </PERSON> said the second visit on Thursday began with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> viewing cassettes of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The two chatted about Viennese cemeteries, and then <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> agreed to answer questions, he said.

<HEAD>`Sweetheart City' Becomes Haven for Sculptors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOVELAND, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two foundries and a willingness to support public art has turned the `` Sweetheart City,'' long known as the town with the special Valentine's Day postmark, into a haven for sculptors. `` Art is in focus all the time here,'' said sculptor <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, 59, who moved to <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> in 1978 from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. `` We've infiltrated the <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, all kinds of groups. About 40 professional sculptors have moved to the northern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> city, most of them in the past five years, and dozens of others come to town part of the year to work with <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION>'s two foundries. <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> is smitten with sculpture, displaying its own collection along roadsides, at a sculpture park, around a new Civic Center, and in galleries and studios around town. This weekend, the city is the site of one of the largest sculpture shows in the world, Sculpture in the Park. Nearly 190 sculptors from around the nation are exhibiting work, and officials hope the show will net the city even more than the $ 3.5 million it did last year. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallsten </PERSON> <PERSON> McGarry </PERSON>, editor of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, called both the town and the huge sculpture show, `` a pretty major force ... as to an actual art event that changes every year with different people bringing new work, I do n't think you can get a broader exposure to a larger number of working sculptors anywhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The city about 40 miles north of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> that has struggled to become known for something more than a place to get a special Valentine's Day postal cancellation began its love affair with sculpture back in 1972. Then, a local metal foundry that made parts for <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> began casting bronze for sculptures and soon was accepting work from artists around the region. Eventually, it drew the artists themselves to <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION>, giving many of them jobs in the business. A second foundry, <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> Sculpture Works, was started by former employees of the original foundry, Art Castings of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Five sculptors who had come to <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> to be near the foundry _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundeen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostermiller </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walbye </PERSON>, White and <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> <PERSON> Williford </PERSON> _ approached the city several years ago about helping promote the arts. The result was the private <ORGANIZATION> Loveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which raises money to buy works and then donates them to the city. The city does its part as well. In 1985, <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> became the first <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> city to pass an ordinance setting aside 1 percent of the construction costs of any public project over $ 50,000 to buy original artwork. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ison </PERSON>, director of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Visual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> now has more than $ 1 million worth of art. In return, the influx of artists breathes new life into the city's economy and cultural life. `` It's an industry in itself,'' City Manager <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> said of sculpture, which employs more than 400 people in the community of 38,200. <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION>'s commitment to the arts has helped economic development efforts. `` We can demonstrate to a company that it's a fairly sophisticated community _ it has hometown values but an unmatched level of art, and many community-minded citizens,'' he said. Downtown merchants, too, are sponsoring a sculpture park on a prime corner to help attract more people. For the artists, that kind of attention and camaraderie make <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> an attractive place. <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> Williford </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> nine years ago to be `` in the foundry's hip pocket.'' Above all, <PERSON> Williford </PERSON> said, he likes the cooperative atmosphere among <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> sculptors. `` In a large city, it's more dog-eat-dog. People are less willing to share. There's too many rats in a cage. When artists back East come visit and we open our doors to them, they ca n't believe it.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of farmers who were originally denied drought insurance payments will split nearly $ 5 million in compensation under an out-of-court settlement. As lawyers agreed to the deal, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury awarded the farmers $ 40 million in damages. But the settlement reached out of the courtroom will stand. In all, the farmers and <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which joined them in their lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to settle the suit for $ 8 million, the amount of the agent's liability insurance. The farmers will collect $ 4.93 million and the <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> companies </ORGANIZATION> will collect $ 3.07 million. The verdict came on the jury's second day of deliberations. `` We're very excited. It's further proof that the farmers had really been taken advantage of,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, lawyer for the farmers. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said the farmers _ 8,800 in 10 states _ should be receiving their money in about one week. He said a court-appointed lawyer will determine the amount farmers will receive. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, paid $ 53 million to settle farmers' claims against it, then joined the farmers' lawsuit against Good Weather, suing to demand $ 77 million in damages The farmers and <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> claimed Good Weather sold more 1988 drought insurance than <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> authorized. But Good Weather, based in <LOCATION> Syosset </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, maintained that <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> encouraged it to continue selling policies. The jury ruled that the company misrepresented the drought insurance availability to the farmers. The jury also ruled that <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> failed to prove its cross-claims against Good Weather and did not award anything to <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>. The jury reached its verdict Friday afternoon as lawyers were in another room at the federal courthouse working out a settlement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> had sealed the verdict until he had a chance to confer with the lawyers. The farmers sued Good Weather for $ 20 million plus punitive damages. The lawsuit represents farmers from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Good Weather's lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> was responsible for the drought policies because the insurer encouraged Good Weather to sell more insurance than the amount authorized in the firms' written contract. After the verdict, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> went immediately to his office and was unavailable for comment. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer, said his company was pleased with the settlement.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast whistle-stop train that derailed and killed 112 people carried many would-be illegal aliens who had planned to slip into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to find work. A bridge weakened by floods and torrential rain collapsed Wednesday, pitching the train into the swirling <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Guasave </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Survivor <PERSON> Cirilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said Friday he had hoped to cross the boarder into <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to escape subsistence farming in <LOCATION> Etla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> in the southern state of <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>. He traveled to the <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state beach resort of <LOCATION> Mazatlan </LOCATION>, and from there took the train for the 700-mile ride to <LOCATION> Mexicali </LOCATION>, across the border from <LOCATION> Calexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. It would have been his first attempt to find work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` From growing corn and beans and burning oak to sell as charcoal, I do n't make anything, just enough to eat,'' said <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 40, a Mexican of Indian descent who spoke Spanish with difficulty. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said his youngest son, 16 years old, has finished junior high school but may not be able to study further. `` I do n't have the money for him to go to school. That's why I was going to look for a way to earn a living,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said in an interview at the <LOCATION> Social </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Security </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inistitute </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was recovering from injuries. He said he hoped to be released today and then would decide whether to continue his trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sinaloa </LOCATION> state health coordinator <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Campana </PERSON> said of the more than 200 injured in the train derailment, 10 remained hospitalized. About 400 people and four helicopters have been searching for more victims, state security coordinator <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Saracho </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Saracho </PERSON> said no more bodies were found Friday, but that the search was to resume early today. Another would-be illegal alien, <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, said the $ 5 a day he earned working at a taco stand in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> was not enough to feed his wife and four children and keep the eldest, a 9-year-old, in school. `` I was going to cross the border. That was my intention,'' he said. But the train crash left him with a leg fracture that will require surgery, and doctors told him he would not be able to work for at least three months. Many people on the train also were en route to visit relatives or just completing summer vacations. People who still had not heard from relatives on the train continued to arrive in <LOCATION> Guasava </LOCATION> on Friday, making the rounds of government offices and hospitals. Officials buried 38 unidentified bodies in the Guasave cemetary, their plots marked by white, nameless crosses. With the burials, relatives had to try to identify the missing from photographs of the bodies.

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a $ 75,000 fine against the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for failing to show adequate preparation for emergencies at two nuclear units. `` The inspectors found that on four of the five rotating crew shifts the shift superintendents were unable to effectively use a classification scheme for emergency severities for certain fast-breaking severe accidents,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> also cited a lack of aggressive management to correct the deficiencies at the utility's <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> reactors.

 An anti-abortion protester promised to appeal a jury's finding that she and two other activists conspired to shut down an abortion clinic that was the target of several arson fires before closing its doors. `` It's a perversion of the First Amendment,'' <PERSON> Dottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said after the jury ruled she violated federal racketeering laws and owed civil damages to the clinic operators. `` This one's going to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' The jury ruled Friday that <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON>, serving 20 years in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> federal prison for setting fire to the Feminist Women's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, violated the <ORGANIZATION> Racketeer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Influenced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrupt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> statute through arson and extortion directed at the clinic <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 53, and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Codispoti </PERSON> conspired to violate the statute, the jury also found. <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON>, who told the jury earlier in the month-long trial that he had no intention of setting any fire until he heard God tell him to do it, was ordered to pay $ 268,500 in civil damages. <PERSON> Beseda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and <PERSON> Codispoti </PERSON> will share another $ 11,000 fine, as well as the clinic's legal expenses and court costs. All damages can be trebled under the RICO statute. The plaintiffs had sought $ 560,029. Two other defendants, <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Undseth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION>, were acquitted. `` I know that I did n't do anything wrong,'' said <PERSON> Codispoti </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. `` At this point I'm taking my strength from that. `` If I had to to it all over again, I'd still go out and picket the abortion clinic.'' The lawsuit is only the second time the racketeering statute, established to fight organized crime, has been used against abortion protesters. Damages will go to several clinic employees and to the <ORGANIZATION> Feminist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yakima </ORGANIZATION>, parent clinic to the one that burned. `` I'm delighted,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, lawyer for the clinic, who said he found the decision `` fundamentally important.'' `` It should be a clear message to anyone'' who protests abortion clinics in the future, he said. Lawyer <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrempp </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, promised an appeal. She said she could not understand how there could be a conspiracy if jurors did not find her client had actually violated the racketeering act. To win under the racketeering statute, one must show that an enterprise adversely affected interstate commerce and constituted a pattern of illegal acts such as arson, extortion, wire fraud, robbery, kidnapping or murder, said <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiryak </PERSON>, the civil rights attorney who tried a recent precedent-setting case in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. There, 26 individuals were found to have committed multiple acts of extortion at an abortion clinic. The clinic was awarded $ 100,000. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> case was upheld on appeal in March and defendants have asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear it. The Everett clinic was burned three times between December 1983 and April 1984, then closed its doors. `` A conspiracy is so hard to prove,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a director of the former clinic. `` I think it's really wonderful that we were able to do it and the jury believed us. If we could do it, other people could do it, too. This is a way they can protect themselves.''

<HEAD>Southern Pacific Agrees to Pay $1.2 Million in Indian Land Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A railroad company will pay an Indian tribe $ 1.2 million to end a century-old dispute over reservation land acquired in the 1860s when the industry steamed its way West. `` As far as the railroad is concerned, we've settled with the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> and we're out of it,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. `` How the money is distributed is up to the government and the tribe. Representatives for the <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paiute </LOCATION> tribe could not be reached by telephone for comment on the trespassing case. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> McKibben </PERSON> on Wednesday signed an order approving the $ 1.2 million settlement, which will be held by the court until officials decide how to distribute the money. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said the class-action lawsuit potentially involves from 300 to 500 <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Paiutes who could get a share of the settlement. The tribe initially sought as much as $ 16 million, while the railroad said the disputed land was worth only about $ 750 when <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> acquired it. The railroad at first offered a $ 30,000 settlement in the case. The dispute involves about 400 acres in west-central <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Wabuska </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to near the northern end of the <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Mineral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The tribe filed suit in 1972 because the railroad never officially gained congressional approval for a right of way through the <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION> to lay out its tracks. The <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> said that as a result, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> was trespassing and the tribe should be compensated for the use of the land that rightfully should belong to the Paiutes. The <ORGANIZATION> 9th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> agreed with the Indians that the railroad failed to comply with several federal acts governing tribal lands. The appeals court last year remanded the case to the district level to award trespassing damages to the tribe. More than 100 year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> agreed to take $ 750 for the land along with the promise from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> for free rides to Indians forever. The railroad agreed, but never built passenger cars for the trains that ran on the line, which carried mostly explosives for area military operations and other goods. As a result, Indians were forced to ride in boxcars or cattle cars or on top of the trains, sometimes falling off, according to old newspaper clippings. `` Members of the tribe were basically treated like cattle,'' says <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, economist who studied the history of the line for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 A custodian has been declared the winner of a $ 3 million Lotto jackpot even though he has no winning ticket to show for it. Sixty-year-old <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> claimed he lost the ticket. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sklodowski </PERSON> believed him, and ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> to make him a millionaire. `` <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> provided evidence that he consistantly played the same two sets of numbers on a weekly basis, and the lottery verified that the winning ticket was purchased at the store where <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said he always bought his tickets,'' said <PERSON> Sklodowski </PERSON> in making the ruling Thursday. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON>, an attorney for the lottery, said the 60-year-old <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> did show officials other tickets with the winning numbers, but all are dated after the Nov. 9, 1985, drawing, <PERSON> Lahr </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, lottery director, said the state has n't decided whether to appeal the ruling. The lottery no longer has the $ 3 million, which has been turned over to the state. If the ruling stands, the lottery may have to ask for a special appropriation, Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> played the same numbers each week _ 4-14-16-29-37-41 _ said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Andjelkovich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s attorney. <PERSON> Andjelkovich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> did n't find out he had won until a year after the drawing, when <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, recognized the winning number in a newspaper article that said no one had yet claimed the $ 3 million Lotto prize. `` <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> screamed ` Oh my God!' and started digging through his lottery tickets,'' <PERSON> Andjelkovich </PERSON> said. `` But he could n't find it.'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and 22 other people filed claims with the lottery for the prize. All were rejected because none had the actual ticket, Ms. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said.

 The spiritual leader of the reputed umbrella group for kidnappers offered to help free foreign hostages if Western powers secure the release of Arabs jailed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Let us get to an agreement together so that each side would use his own means and influence to end the crisis of the hostages, all hostages, and resolve the problem of Arab prisoners,'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, who advises the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, spoke at the Bir el-Abed mosque in the Shiite Moslem slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during Ashoura ceremonies commemorating the most revered Shiite saint, Imam <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, grandson of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. Shiites held Ashoura parades Friday, trampling <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags inscribed `` Death to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Eight Americans and eight other Western hostages are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most of them by radical Shiite groups believed associated with <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, whose name means Party of God. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s statement seemed to corroborate an offer made earlier this month by the captors of <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> after they suspended plans to kill the American hostage. They said they would free <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released 450 Arab prisoners and allowed 55 Palestinian deportees to return to the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to exchange <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Hezbollah-affiliated cleric kidnapped July 28 in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and hundreds of other Lebanese Shiite prisoners for three Israelis soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the Western hostages. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has refused to negotiate. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s comments `` interesting'' and said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration hopes `` it signals their desire to release the hostages.'' `` We would like to lower our voices a little and let these issues play out for a few days and see what happens,'' he said. Parades marking the Ashoura holiday were held in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and in towns in eastern and southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> populations. The Ashoura holiday commemorates the killing of the saint <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> by Moslem armies after a 10-day siege at <LOCATION> Karbala </LOCATION>, now part of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The battle was part of the fight over succession to <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> that eventually split Islam into Sunni and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> branches. About 10,000 men, women and children participated in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Most were dressed in black and beat their heads and chests. Ahead of the marchers were loudspeaker vans covered with black cloth and portraits of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, the Iranian revolutionary patriarch who died in June, and his successor, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>.

<UNK>Justice Minister Warns Estonian Voting Law Illegal</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Soviet justice minister said <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s effort to tighten voting residency laws that have sparked a strike by thousands of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> workers is unconstitutional. A nationwide newspaper placed the number of strikers in the small Baltic republic at about 40,000, more than twice as many as local journalists and the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency estimated. <PERSON> Veniamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, Soviet justice minister, Friday told the evening television news program `` Vremya'' that <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> ought to reconsider the law, which sets residence requirements to protect Estonians' hold on the republic. `` I think it's obvious that this Estonian law does n't correspond to our constitution,'' <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said. `` This means that a significant portion of the population will be left out.'' <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said the law, passed Tuesday, also violated international conventions on civil rights that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has signed. But instead of flatly declaring the law void, <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> appealed to the Estonian Supreme Soviet to reconsider it. Under the law, residents of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> can not vote unless they have lived in the same district for at least two years, or have lived anywhere in the republic for a total of five years. Candidates for elective office must live in the same place for five years, or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. Russian-speaking workers walked off their jobs the day after the law was passed, and sent a delegation to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to seek meetings with national officials. <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Makismov </PERSON>, a member of the strike committee, said in an interview from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> that one member of the delegation had returned and was meeting with strikers this morning. <PERSON> Maksimov </PERSON> said railroad stations were on strike and that the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> airline was shipping only emergency items such as medical supplies and equipment. Passenger service was not affected. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sotsialisticheskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriya </ORGANIZATION> reported today that more than 30 factories and other state-run businesses were on strike, including about 40,000 workers. `` Dialogue between the leaders of the republic and the strikers has practically come to a halt,'' it said. The Estonian leadership acknowledged in a statement released Friday that it failed to `` take into account fully the growth of national consciousness among the non-Estonian population of the republic,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Estonian parliament banned strikes Thursday, but the strikers ignored the action. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> on Friday put the number of strikers in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> at 16,000. A few enterprises in <LOCATION> Kokhla-Jarve </LOCATION>, a mining town east of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, also were reported to be on strike. Strike committee members said workers at 42 Estonian factories and firms walked out, but local journalists said they counted only about 24 Estonian enterprises with striking employees. Non-Estonian residents of the republic, including leaders of the Russian-dominated InterMovement group, complain the law is aimed at them because many are new arrivals. They are also upset by a law making Estonian the official language. Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the population. Russians make up about a third of the 1.6 million people. <PERSON> Sotsialisticheskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Industriya </PERSON> quoted striking workers as complaining that they want to get into courses to learn Estonian, but that the few available are crowded and expensive.

 The mailman who killed his wife and two co-workers before ending the shooting spree with a bullet to his head has died. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 52, died Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, soon after relatives gave permission for discontinuation of life support, hospital spokesman <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jourdier </PERSON> said. Police remain baffled by <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s outburst Thursday and investigators seeking a motive said the answers may have died with <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. A model employee with a domestic life police described as typically American, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> first shot his wife to death in the couple's home and then drove to work at the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glenn </ORGANIZATION> post office, where he killed two colleagues and wounded another. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> then turned the gun on himself. `` It may be that <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> just snapped,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Star </PERSON>, the police detective in charge of the case. `` We're looking for the reason, but if we do n't find one soon, we'll close the investigation.'' Investigators spent Friday interviewing dozens of witnesses and family members. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s home, located about seven blocks from the post office, and car also were searched but officers found no notes or letters to explain his actions. <PERSON> Star </PERSON> said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> shot his wife in her sleep at least three times with a .22 - caliber semiautomatic pistol, and then went to the post office, where he opened fire on two friends, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 56, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berni </PERSON>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berni </PERSON> were shot as they drank coffee and talked. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> typically joined them in the routine, <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> then went into the post office and fired at least five rounds, wounding postal clerk <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Derisi </PERSON> in the arm.

 Four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopters joined an aerial search today for Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 15 others missing since their plane left for a southwestern refugee camp five days ago. Also today, Ethiopian helicopters rechecked one of two areas outside the plane's flight path where a satellite picked up an apparent distress signal, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in the capital. The UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters arrived Friday from <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and joined two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> C-130 Hercules cargo planes in the search of the rugged mountains southwest of the capital, <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said. `` They are capable of staying in the air all day because the C-130s have refueling capability,'' <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said. He said search efforts by the C-130s was concentrated on the intended flight path of the twin-engine plane that disappeared Monday with <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> on board. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, was accompanied by eight other Americans. The Twin Otter aircraft, owned by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s government relief agency, was en route from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> to the Fugnido refugee camp 450 miles away near the Sudanese border. The C-130s joined the search Thursday when they arrived from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said today that the weather `` was not cooperating, but they are able to search.'' Weather has hampered the search since it began Tuesday and may have played a role in the disappearance of the Canadian-made plane, which seats up to 20 passengers. Officials have said the plane's takeoff Monday morning was delayed two hours by rough weather and that it departed in heavy clouds and poor visibility The site of the apparent distress signal being checked again is in an area around <LOCATION> Goba </LOCATION> about 85 miles southeast of the capital, <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said its weather satellites picked up signals in that area as well as about 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. A land and air search of both areas on Friday turned up nothing. Asked how the satellites could have recorded false signals, <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> replied, `` I've been trying to get an answer to that myself.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s plane was equipped with an emergency locator transmittor, a device usually mouted in the tail of an aircraft and activated either automatically by impact or manually by the pilot. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday the passengers had some box lunches, one or two cases of soft drinks and 35 gallons of water. The prospect of temperatures that can drop to freezing at night was a troubling factor. Planes must fly over mountainous terrain to reach the Fugnido refugee camp, but the route was not over the area where rebels are battling <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s government. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s separatist movements are based in the northern part of the country in the Horn of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> complained Friday that the rescue effort lacked urgency. `` With all of the sophisticated surveillance that we have, with all of the sophisticated equipment we have, we should have located them by now,'' <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> defended the search efforts, which involved scores of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel. `` I can understand the anxiety of all this and I can understand the concern that people that love <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> feel and that I feel,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But there's a lot going on, so let's just hope and pray he's OK.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said late Friday that 170 military personnel had been assigned to the search and that the number soon would reach 260 <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Record </PERSON>, director of operations for <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, was to leave today to take charge of the search, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The Pentagon said in a statement that two U-2 photographic reconnaissance planes had exposed more than a mile of film in runs over the 56,000-square mile search area, of which about 60 percent was covered by clouds. Twelve Ethiopian helicopters also participated in the search. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said the eight other Americans aboard included three members of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s staff, a friend of the congressman's, three officers of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> officers and the spouse of one AID official. Also aboard were an Ethiopian employee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, three Ethiopian officials and the crew. Two of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s congressional colleagues, Reps. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> early Friday to observe the search effort.

 The new foreign minister says Americans are to blame for trade friction with his country because they do n't understand <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, speak its language or try hard enough to penetrate the Japanese market The comments by <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> on Friday came the same day Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said he will visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month to meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and reaffirm relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the foundation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign policy. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>, a physician appointed Wednesday after <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> took office, said `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts are lacking'' and that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s distribution system should not be held responsible for trade tensions `` While I am, of course, aware of the various opinions emanating from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side in regard to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s distribution system, the distribution systems of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> differ as the countries themselves differ,'' he said. He said `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must speak its mind'' to bring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> around to its way of thinking. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business leaders blame the large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ $ 55 billion last year _ on Japanese trade barriers, and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lawmakers have called for retaliatory action. Americans often complain that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s complex distribution system, in which longstanding relationships and delivery practices take precedence over efficiency and cost cutting, are major barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods. The foreign minister said <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> have made considerable progress in improving their understanding of the Japanese market but still depend too much on Japanese who speak English rather than learning the language themselves. `` How many Americans working in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> can speak perfect Japanese?'' he said. <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> was a member of a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committee that negotiated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on trade issues. Referring to that experience, he said: `` Americans then appeared to understand <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but in fact did not. That's why it is so necessary to talk at length with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If that is not done, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as can be expected of them, will come up with various unilateral moves.'' In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> was quoted as saying he expected the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to offer to return a group of small islands off northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in exchange for Japanese technology and investment. Soviet soldiers have occupied the islands since the end of World War II, and the dispute over them has kept the two nations from signing a peace treaty. `` As international relations change, the Soviet government authorities change and their way of thinking will change as well to adapt to international circumstances,'' <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> on Friday pledged to push political and tax reform as a way of preventing the kind of scandals and unpopular policies that brought down his two predecessors and cost his governing Liberal Democrats an upper house election. He succeeded <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who resigned after only two months in office to take responsibility for the governing party's election defeat last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost their majority in the upper house of Parliament for the first time since the party was formed in 1955. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> took over from <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned June 2 to take responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> influence-buying scandal, which reached the top ranks of politics, the bureaucracy and business. Uno also was plagued by allegations that he had kept paid mistresses. On Friday, only two days after taking office, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> denied a newspaper report that he had an illegitimate child as the result of an affair with a model, and he demanded a retraction.

In the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> met with officials from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s five <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries _ <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION> _ to avert walkouts at 11:59 p.m. tonight, when three-year contracts expire for 37,000 union workers. `` We're hopeful that we'll reach a settlement by the deadline,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cose </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> issued a new contract proposal Friday in an effort to ward off a strike tonight, but a union spokesman said the offer is inadequate. `` It falls far short of acceptable levels in wages, health care, job security, working conditions, protection of retiree health benefits and other important areas,'' T.O. <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, vice president of District 6 of the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. The union represents about 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The proposal offers union employees guaranteed jobs and a bigger pay increase, but it still requires them to pay part of their health insurance bills. The company has picked up the entire health insurance tab in the past. Meanwhile, striking electrical workers Friday held their first formal talks with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> since the strike began early Sunday. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON> did not disclose the proposals exchanged by the two sides, but said it was encouraging negotiations had resumed. Representatives of more than 41,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> members were scheduled to resume formal negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday. Three regional telephone company strikes began Sunday after negotiations broke down over wage, health care and various local issues. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> operates in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Strikes also continued against <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The strikes affected 157,000 union workers in 15 states. The three regional telephone companies are continuing operations by placing managers in jobs normally held by union members. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, several hundred striking workers and their supporters shouted `` scab'' at phone company managers and customers who crossed a picket line. One customer received a police escort to leave the building. <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON>, business manager of Local 2222 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said the strikers would not accept the company's demands to share in health insurance costs, even if that meant a long strike. `` You ca n't sell something like this when the membership does n't want it,'' <PERSON> Calvey </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> has paid 100 percent of its employees' health insurance costs for more than a decade, but now wants its workers to contribute. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 32 of the state's union local presidents are scheduled to meet Tuesday to plan a campaign to urge a national phone bill boycott. `` What we are going to do is put the word out across the country that people living in any struck area should not pay their telephone bills,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Martini </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> official.

 Three men convicted of throwing paint on the portait of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-Tung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> during the pro-democracy movement were given prison terms ranging from 16 years to life. The <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in sentencing the men Friday, said they were guilty of `` counterrevolutionary destruction and counterrevolutionary incitement and must be punished severely,'' the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Evening News reported. The court sentenced high school teacher <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhijian </PERSON> to life in prison and gave 16-year and 20-year prison terms to two accomplices, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dongyue </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Decheng </PERSON>. The three, all in their 20s, are from central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s birthplace. Offical reports say they came to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> May 19, one day before martial law was declared, to take part in student-led pro-democracy protests. On May 23, as tens of thousands of protesters paraded through <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the men threw black and red paint at the nearly 30-foot-tall portrait of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> that hangs from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> gate overlooking the square. Splotches of paint smeared <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s neck, collar and one eyebrow, and a long line of paint ran down the side of his nose and mouth. Workers quickly covered the portrait with canvas, and that night a crane removed it and put a nearly identical portrait in its place. The men were grabbed on the spot by angry student protesters who, after some debate, turned them over to police. The students said they opposed vandalism. The army crushed the pro-democracy movement June 3-4 when troops fired on unarmed civilians and drove the demonstrators from the square. The government says 200 people were killed; Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say up to 3,000 died.

<HEAD>Registration of Presidential Candidates Ends in Chile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Registration of presidential candidates closed with a Christian Democrat backed by a 17-party opposition group pitted against an ex-Cabinet member under rightist military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Also Friday, a government spokesman said Cabinet changes will be announced next week. He said some ministers were expected to step down and run for senator in the scheduled Dec. 14 general elections, the first since a bloody 1973 coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, 70, the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> president, and <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, 40, finance minister for four years until he resigned in April, were the principal presidential candidates to register with the national elections board. A conservative businessman, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON>, and an internationally recognized child nutrition specialist, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Monckeberg </PERSON>, also registered but were not expected to draw widespread support. Opinion polls show <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a former senate president, with a huge lead over <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> is supported by 17 centrist and leftist parties that united last year to defeat a referendum proposal that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remain in power until 1997. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON> emerged only Thursday night as the principal pro-government candidate when a rival, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarpa </PERSON>, 68, announced he would not run for president. <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, an independent, is backed by the <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> government and a well-financed group of business leaders. They pressed <PERSON> Jarpa </PERSON>, leader of National Renovation, not to split the pro-government camp by opposing <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>. National Renovation is the principal rightist party. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> could not run because the constitution prohibits a president from holding two consecutive terms. He has said he plans, however, to remain commander of the country's powerful army for eight more years. The law bars the new president from removing him from that post. Registration of candidates for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> also ended on Friday, with more than 300 pursuing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s 120 seats. Registration of candidates for the 38 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats ends Sept. 7. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 73, seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, toppling an elected leftist government during a period of social and economic disorder. He was obliged to call elections when voters last October rejected a proposal that he remain the nation's leader until 1997.

<HEAD>Animal Activists Disrupt Start of Grouse Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Animal rights campaigners crept onto moors before dawn in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> today to disrupt an already quiet Glorious Twelfth of August, the traditional opening of the grouse season. About 90 supporters of the Hunt Saboteurs' Association occupied two northern English moors in <LOCATION> Geltsdale </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Carlisle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stanhope </PERSON> to shoo away the birds, said a spokesman, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponton </PERSON>. `` The action will go on as long as it has to,'' he said. `` The shooting parties are driving around but have made no attempt to get onto the moors.'' Another 100 members had also gathered in <LOCATION> Bowland </LOCATION> but thick mist had kept hunters away, said <PERSON> Ponton </PERSON>, whose group annually tries to disrupt the shooting of the prized game. Aristocrats and wealthy tourists organize hunting parties on Scottish and English moors to kick off the Glorious Twelfth, and in past years restaurants have vied to bring the birds to the table. But this year disease has decimated the flocks, leading to the cancellation of many shoots. `` Grouse numbers are 20 percent down in some parts of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and there's no shooting at all today in parts of the north of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'' where populations have fallen 50 percent, said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> of the private research group the Game Conservancy. Influenced by the animal protesters of recent years and worries over declining numbers of the birds, hotels and restaurants have all but dropped their own colorful races to serve the birds. The prestigious Gleneagles Hotel, once a forerunner in the competition, said it will donate the money it would have used for the race to grouse preservation research for a fifth year. But the bird will still feature on the menu of some restaurants, served with thin fried potatoes, parsley and a bread sauce.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An interstate chase that turned into a standoff between police and kidnappers armed with grenades and holding three hostages stretched into a fourth day today on a south-central highway, officials said. The kidnappers, identified as two married couples who earlier obtained a $ 42,000 ransom in exchange for freeing a 9-year-old boy they abducted, set a 3 p.m. -LRB- 2 p.m. EDT -RRB- deadline to swap their captives for food, a pilot and a getaway helicopter to fly them to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. `` The trade will be made at that time without any tricks,'' police Officer <PERSON> Nivaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirondi </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Presidente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prudente </LOCATION>, near the site of the standoff and 525 miles west of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want to do anything to provoke the kidnappers and put the hostages' lives at risk,'' de <PERSON> Pirondi </PERSON> said. `` We are dealing with professionals, but they are charged up and could do something irrational at any moment.'' He said the hostages _ two TV reporters and the driver of the armored car _ were in fair physical condition. They were being held in the armored car, which about 100 heavily armed police have surrounded since early Friday with sharpshooters aiming at the car's small windows. The standoff began after a three-day chase through south-central <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, police said. Authorities were delayed in meeting the kidnappers' demands because the first aircraft developed mechanical trouble and was grounded in a nearby field, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirondi </PERSON> said. He said a second helicopter was summoned from <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, and was due to arrive early this afternoon. The drama began Aug. 3, when the two couples abducted 9-year-old Said <PERSON> Agel </PERSON> <PERSON> Filho </PERSON> from his home in the central Brazilian city of <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>, 565 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>. The kidnapping was kept secret at first to protect the child, police said. Six days later, police found where the boy was being held, but the kidnappers negotiated a ransom of about $ 42,000 and an armored car for their getaway. They then took the two TV reporters and headed for the <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> Goias </LOCATION> state authorities failed to provide an airplane and pilot for their escape, and the kidnappers set off on an interstate flight through the states of <LOCATION> Goias </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Minas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerais </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>.

 Masked Palestinians today killed two Arabs suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, stabbing one and hanging the other in a school courtyard, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and allied Lebanese militiamen Thursday night shot and wounded a guerrilla whose unit planned to infiltrate <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the army said. The wounded man was captured, but his companions escaped. In the Askar refugee camp near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, masked Palestinians repeatedly stabbed <PERSON> Murshed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaniery </PERSON>, 55, after accusing him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security forces, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. He died later in a <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> hospital. In <LOCATION> Bidiya </LOCATION> village near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, masked Arabs hanged 30-year-old school teacher <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Taha </PERSON> in his school's courtyard, <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> said Palestinians said the army imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Bidiya </LOCATION> after the early-morning killing and deployed hundreds of troops to search the village and surrounding fields for the attackers. The deaths raised to at least 94 the number of Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs during the 20-month-old uprising against Israeli rule, most of them on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Troops or Jewish settlers have killed 534 Palestinians during the uprising. Thirty-eight Jews have also been killed. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers detected the guerrilla squad near <LOCATION> Markaba </LOCATION> village in the central sector of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone, an army statement said. The force opened fire, wounding one guerilla who was captured by <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militiamen allied with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the statement said. The rest of the squad escaped. None of the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or militia troops was injured. The statement said the squad apparently planned to carry out an attack on a northern Israeli settlement, but it gave no details. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and militia units conducted widespread searches for the other guerrillas and quoted a senior army officer as saying they apparently were Palestinians. The clash occurred 1.5 miles from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> settlement of Misgav Am near the Lebanese border. It was the third incident in the security zone this month. On Wednesday, five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were wounded, one of them critically, when a suicide bomber from the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militia drove an explosive-laden car into an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> convoy two miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border near <LOCATION> Qleiaa </LOCATION> village. A militiaman also was wounded in the blast. On Aug. 1, militiamen shot and killed three guerillas from the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> in the central sector of the security zone near <LOCATION> Hula </LOCATION> village.

 Indian troops killed at least 51 civilians after being attacked by Tamil rebels in a northern town, Tamil sources said today. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 40 houses and 23 shops were set on fire by the soldiers after an army patrol was ambushed Aug. 2 in the town of <LOCATION> Velvettiturai </LOCATION>, 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. At least six soldiers were killed in the attack, military officials said at the time. The Tamil sources, who have proved reliable in the past, quoted residents as saying the Indian peacekeeping troops imposed a 48-hour curfew on Velvettiturai after the ambush and carried out search operations. Many houses were shelled and several people were burned to death, the sources said. They said that 51 victims were identified by relatives after the curfew was withdrawn. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the rebel group fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement telexed to newspaper offices that at least 70 civilians were killed in the offensive. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' accounts of casualties have proved to be exaggerated in the past Sri Lankan military officials confirmed a major operation by Indian troops occurred in <LOCATION> Velvettiturai </LOCATION>, but they said they did not have details because they do not operate in the Tamil-dominated areas of the country. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said there were 18 civilian casualties in an exchange of gunfire between the soldiers and the rebels after the ambush. He said the rebels used civilians as cover while firing with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles at the Indian army patrol. `` The troops returned fire and 30 bodies were recovered after the fighting,'' said the spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules. `` At least five were hard-core <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and seven others were sympathizers.'' `` Eighteen unfortunate civilians were killed in the cross fire,'' he said. The spokesman denied that civilians were killed during the curfew. `` The Tamils in <LOCATION> Velvettiturai </LOCATION> will say whatever the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> tell them to,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' capacity to kill fellow Tamils is unlimited and they live in fear of retribution.'' Indian soldiers have been in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Tamil-dominated north and east for the past two years to put down the Tamil war for an independent homeand. They were deployed to supervise an India-sponsored accord under which <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> offered Tamils limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> rejected the agreement and turned their guns on the Indians. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> got involved because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and allege they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and the military. Militant Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983. At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed in the fighting.

 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners locked in one of their fiercest battles in months pummeled the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area today in an exchange that reportedly left at least 12 people dead and 48 wounded. Smoke from shells and fires in nearby hills hung like a funeral shroud over the city. Five months of such duels have prompted all but about 200,000 of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million residents to flee. Police said at least 12 people were killed and 48 wounded in today's fighting between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> troops and 40,000 Syrian soldiers and their Moslem militia allies. More than 40 have died in the past two days, bringing the toll since March 8 to 598 killed and 1,562 wounded, according to security sources. Radios interrupted their programs with bulletins about where shells were falling and to report fires blazing out of control in several parts of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said fierce clashes with machine guns, recoilless cannons and rocket-propelled grenade launchers raged across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line and the eastern flank of the Christian enclave. Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, who heads the Moslem cabinet vying for power with the military cabinet under <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, said: `` We're left in the blowing wind with no roof above us. `` The problem in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is that our wise people are not active and our active people are not wise,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio. The French and Argentine embassies in neighboring <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> were hit by Syrian rockets and one French embassy guard was slightly wounded, security sources said. The embassies are only a hundred yards away from the shell-shattered presidential palace, where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has been living in a bunker since the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war began in March. The security sources said the residences of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and French Ambassador <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> in suburban <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> came under shellfire for a second night in a row, but no casualties or serious damage were reported. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today that it had asked Syrian officials in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to immediately end the Syrian bombardments. The ministry also called for all sides to lift blockades and begin peace talks. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> called for all parties to cease fire, but she also singled out <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for its use of heavy weapons against civilians. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condemns the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people and the renewed use of heavy caliber weapons, such as the 240-millimeter mortar, which are in the Syrian arsenal,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We again call upon <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, an active participant in the fighting, the Lebanese armed forces, as well as the various Lebanese factions, for an immediate cease-fire.'' A police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing regulations, said Syrian gunners opened fire at 6 a.m. from multibarreled rocket launchers at the Christian enclave, shattering a two-hour lull in the fighting. The whooshing sound of outgoing rockets echoed across the mountains southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A few minutes later, howitzer shells fired by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners crashed into the region, sending palls of dust and smoke into the sky. Syrian soldiers deserted their sand-bagged checkpoints at the <LOCATION> Khaldeh </LOCATION> junction south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and sought refuge in fox holes along the sandy coast. Several motorists abandoned their cars and fled under the main highway bridge in <LOCATION> Khaldeh </LOCATION>. Others sped away. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners, using 155-mm U.S.-made howitzers, concentrated their shelling on Syrian artillery emplacements, truck-mounted rocket launchers and communications posts in the hills of <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Doha </LOCATION>, above <LOCATION> Khaldeh </LOCATION>. A howitzer shell, fired by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners, scored a direct hit on a 40-barrel rocket launcher on a hilltop in <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION>, setting it on fire. Black smoke billowed from the truck-mounted launcher for 20 minutes, during which the Syrians intensified their shelling of the Christian enclave, operating more than a dozen rocket launchers in unison. Security sources said rockets and shells fired by Syrian gunners targeted almost every town and village in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the capital.

<TEXT>
 The fifth congress of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, the largest arm of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, has issued a final declaration rejecting terrorism but reaffirming the right to armed struggle against Israeli occupation. The declaration, made public late Friday night, said the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> has decided to mobilize `` all means'' to assure continuation of the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. It also called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` clearly recognize'' the right of Palestinians to self-determination and an independent state. The eight-day congress of more than 1,000 delegates of the mainstream branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ended Thursday. It had called on Tuesday for `` intensification of the armed struggle and all other forms of battle to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.'' The final declaration reiterated the call to intensify the uprising, mobilizing `` all means'' available. It also called for the reinforcement of the uprising's unified command and developing a role for people's committees. The congress reiterated <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>'s rejections of `` all forms of terrorism, notably state terrorism.'' But it reaffirmed its `` right to use all means, including armed struggle, to confront the Israeli occupier, in conformity with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> declarations on the rights of the Palestinian people.'' The final statement deplored the slow pace of the U.S.-PLO dialogue, which got under way Dec. 16. It called on the Americans to `` clearly recongize the right of Palestinians to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state having <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as its capital, and to depart from their partiality vis-a-vis <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened a formal dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> after the organization's leader, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, renounced terrorism and implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist.

<HEAD>Catholic Group Suspects U.S. Involvement With Philippine Vigilantes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of Roman Catholic priests and nuns announced today it has asked national lawmakers to investigate whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has promoted anti-Communist vigilantes in this country. The Philippine military has used vigilante groups as support units to combat a 20-year-old communist insurgency. Some members belong to religious cults, and some have been criticized for violating human rights during sweeps of suspected rebel hideouts. In its statement distributed to news agencies today, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superiors </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> said it had asked the country's two-chamber <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` to initiate a comprehensive investigation into and expose the extent of reported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement, both directly and indirectly, in supporting the formation, training and operation of vigilante groups.'' It said, `` The nation is caught in a vicious war and is experiencing an escalation of violence. This phenomenon is not unconnected with an international organized effort to polarize the situation along ideological lines.'' The statement gave no specifics of purported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement with vigilante groups. The Catholic group, which includes at least 10,000 priests and nuns, also requested the investigation during its national convention late last month.

 <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s astronauts closed down experiments and checked flight control systems today as they prepared to end their secret military mission on Sunday with a landing in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert. Commander <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for the return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Mission specialists <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> were to pack up the experiments, some of which were believed to be connected with the `` Star Wars'' spaceborne missile defense project. Others tested the astronauts' capabilities as military observers in space. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> broke the official silence on the mission today to announce that <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> would land at 9:37 a.m. EDT Sunday in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after a flight of five days, one hour. Earlier, it had said only that landing would take place between 9 a.m. and noon. `` The crew is doing well and is beginning landing preparations,'' a statement said. The weather forecast called for excellent landing conditions at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION> on Sunday, with partly cloudy skies and temperatures expected from 68 just after sunrise to a midday high of 97 degrees. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base, which has been host to as many as half a million people for shuttle landings, will be closed to the public Sunday because of the military nature of the flight.

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes Before Protestant March, IRA Claims Responsibility</HEAD>

 A large <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb exploded downtown today hours before Protestants marched through the streets on the tense anniversaries of both ancient and recent sectarian strife in the region. The bomb caused no injuries, and the annual Apprentice Boys' Parade marking the end of a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> siege of the city 300 years ago began on schedule Marching bands featuring piping flutes and humming accordions alternated with men carrying banners commemorating the siege. `` The way we look at it we're more besieged than ever before,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> farmer from <LOCATION> Dungannon </LOCATION> district, as he watched the marchers. The bomb `` means we have no security. For the amount of money they're spending, we should get better security.'' Sectarian violence at the parade 20 years ago led to the deployment of British troops in the province two days later, and heralded the start of the sectarian and political warfare that has torn the province since then. Supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fighting the troops plan a march Sunday in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> to mark the anniversary and the introduction of an unpopular British policy of internment, since ended but not forgotten. Security forces were on full alert throughout the province and extra police and soldiers were stationed in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. Police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 a.m. in a Butcher Street bar which was `` extensively damaged.'' It had been discovered by security forces who evacuated the area, but it exploded before army experts could defuse it, said a spokesman who refused to be named. The bar, which was closed, was near the parade route on the fringes of a Catholic area where extra police were to be deployed, he said. `` It's close to an area where there might be opposition to the parade,'' he said. Later, the outlawed mainly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the bomb, saying it was timed to go off while security forces were in the area. An estimated 15,000 Protestants were expected to turn out for the parade marking the relief of the city in August 1689 from the besieging army of Catholic King <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. It is named after the 13 apprentice boys who shut the city gates against <PERSON> James </PERSON>' army at the start of the 105-day siege. On Sunday, the <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> parade will mark the 18th anniversary of the now-abandoned policy of internment without trial for terrorist suspects introduced Aug. 9, 1971, as well as the arrival of British troops. Almost 2,000 people were held for varying lengths of time without trial before <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abandoned internment in December 1975 following worldwide condemnation. <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters, who were the main targets of internment, continue to mark the anniversary of its introduction each year with bonfire-lit demonstrations and sporadic rioting sometimes lasting several days. Tension has been heightened by the death of a 15-year-old Catholic, <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>. British news reports said he died Wednesday when he was hit by a plastic bullet fired by police after they were attacked during anti-internment rioting in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. But his friends and family deny he was involved in rioting. About 1,000 mourners attended the boy's funeral in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Friday, which passed peacefully but caused rioting Friday night by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> youths in the north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> area where he lived. Cars were set on fire and two youths were injured when police fired plastic bullets to control the trouble, reported the British new agency, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. British troops in the province currently number more than 10,000, compared a peak of 22,000 at the height of the violence in 1972. They are backed by 6,500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, a locally recruited unit of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' striking unions today launched a large new lobbying effort after a week when hundreds of their own pilots and flight attendants crossed picket lines. `` Now they're out there telling the world it's over. Well, it's not over,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, exhorted some 300 people at a morning rally across the street from Eastern corporate headquarters `` So hang in there. There'll be good news coming.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, national president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and other leaders on the first blocks of a `` moving picket line'' march that began a 26-day, 13-state series of parades, motorcades, rallies and lobbying efforts. `` Before this is over, the whole country's going to wake up to what's going on,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union local. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, Machinists and flight attendants are also participating in the rallies, but the strike's sixth month has begun with a wave of picket-line defections, prompting Eastern to say Friday it no longer needed to hire pilots. Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days after being hit by a crippling strike by its three unions March 4, plans to rebuild to an airline two-thirds its pre-strike size. The company's plan for its creditors said it would be flying 800 daily flights with 1,700 pilots by the end of the year. Eastern has 350 daily flights, compared to nearly 1,100 before the strike. Company spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> declined to give figures on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots, but sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said more than 600 union pilots are flying, including some 250 who have crossed picket lines since the union leadership last weekend discussed ending the strike. Eastern has graduated 300 newly hired pilots from training and has from 700 to 800 in training. Veteran pilots who want to return to work now will instead be put on `` a preferential recall list'' and given priority for future openings, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was skeptical about whether <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has hired enough qualified pilots, but said Friday's announcement will stop the flow of pilot crossovers. `` There were people who crossed the picket line because of uncertainty,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. `` That will stop now. Thank you, Eastern.'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said the vast majority of the 3,600 <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots remain strongly committed to the strike. Meanwhile, officials said the number of flight attendants abandoning the strike after more than five months has also jumped this week. A source who spoke on the condition of not being identified said 140 flight attendants crossed the picket lines this week, probably because of perceptions that the pilot crossovers hurt the strike. `` I'm not really sure on the complete impact,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, president of the flight attendants union. `` When there's a breaking in the ranks, it affects all of us.'' She said she did n't have any figures on total flight attendant crossovers, but did not dispute a figure of at least 1,000 from the union's 6,000 members. Eastern's rebuilding plan calls for 3,400 flight attendants. Company officials have said 1,000 new flight attendants have been hired or are in training. Eastern has received 31,000 applications and is being `` very, very selective,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. The 8,500-member <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, joined by the other two unions when it struck March 4 after 1 -LCB- years of federal mediation failed, has held relatively solid. Some 100 union mechanics are working for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which also has hired several hundred more and is using 700 supervisors in maintenance roles. Eastern wants 2,500 mechanics by year's end, the company has said.

 <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> `` Radar'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, a short hitter playing on a long course, took a two-stroke lead today into the third round of the 71st PGA championship. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> shot 34-33_67 in Friday's rain-delayed round to go with his opening round of 66 for an 11-under-par 133. Trailing <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> were <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who shared the first-round lead with <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON> at 135. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, another stroke back at 136, was seeking the only major championship he has not won in his quest for a rare career grand slam of the major tournaments. <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON> shot a course record 33-31_64 in a bogey-free second round for his 135. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> made the cut of one-over-par 145 for the top 70 scorers. <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> had a four-under 140 and <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, who electrified the crowds Thursday with a 68, had a second-round 74 for 142.

Because of the rain delay Friday, the last eight groups of 24 golfers finished the second round early this morning. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who earned his nickname because of his exact shot-making ability, agreed that he was an unlikely leader. `` But that's the great thing about sports,'' he said. `` The -LRB- <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> -RRB- Cubs should n't be in first place in August, either.'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 39, stayed close while the other heroes of decades past, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, fell back. `` If you'd asked me two months ago if I had a chance to win the PGA, I'd have said ` no,''' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said Friday. `` The leader board says ` yes.''' It says no to <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 59, and <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON>, 49, despite their impressive early play. <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> called his round `` another adventure. I had only one easy par. I was all over the course. If it had n't been for my putter, I'd be in the 80s.'' He has n't been using his driver because of his erratic play with it. `` I'm going to use my driver if I can,'' he said. `` If I hit it, it will give me a chance to get home in two. I need it on a few holes.'' Does that mean <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> still thinks he can win his sixth PGA title? `` I'm in good shape. When you're four under in the <ORGANIZATION> PGA </ORGANIZATION>, I do n't care who's leading, I know I'm not going to be very far off. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> made the turn at five under, but dropped a shot at No. 11 with a bogey-5. `` Three-putting No. 11 threw me off track,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was marching again after his exciting opening round. He missed a five-foot putt for a birdie at No. 12 and took a double bogey-5 at the 13th. `` Other than that, I had a solid round,'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said. `` I did n't feel any letdown, I just had to work hard to keep it together.'' <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> parred the last five holes and said, `` I still feel good and I feel good about the way I'm hitting the ball.'' It marked the first time <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> has made the cut in a major tournament since the 1987 PGA. He made the cut in all four majors in 1983. Play was suspended Friday for one hour, 48 minutes in the afternoon because of a rainstorm. Once again, the 7,197-yard Kemper Lakes layout had ideal playing conditions despite the rain delay, and the game's greatest players took advantage. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who missed only one green and one fairway Thursday, missed five fairways and four greens in the second round. `` It was n't as pretty,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said, `` but I showed some character. I hung in there and got the most out of my round.'' <PERSON> Stadler </PERSON> called his round `` very enjoyable. I made all the three, four, five-foot putts I had. I did n't miss a fairway yesterday and I missed only two or three today. I was happy with a solid round to get back in the tournament.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> also did n't play as well as he did in the first round. `` The first part of my round today was an adventure until I settled down,'' said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who had an eagle, four birdies and three bogeys. <PERSON> Strange </PERSON> said he would like to see the wind come up because `` <LOCATION> Kemper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> is playing too easy. It is a tougher course than it is playing.''

 A fire destroyed 300 acres of forest land on this popular resort island before it was brought under control Saturday. No injuries or property damage were reported. The wind-whipped fire started Friday evening in the central part of the island and spread quickly, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Despite the efforts of two small firefighting planes and hundreds of firefighters, the blaze raged out of control through the night. As dawn approached, five more firefighting aircraft arrived from the mainland and together with 600 firefighters and soldiers they brought the fire under control at 10:15 a.m., the service said.

<TEXT>
 After the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> finished writing the landmark 1986 tax overhaul, Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> hung a `` gone fishin''' sign on the office door to dramatize that the time had come to stop changing the tax law. The fish apparently were n't biting. Since that time, the committee and the counterpart <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have kept themselves busy adding to, rolling back, correcting and otherwise changing the new law. There was the Revenue Act of 1987, about 200 changes designed chiefly to raise revenue for budget reduction. Next came the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, whose explanation alone filled a 291-page book. Then, the catastrophic-illness law, which imposed a new surtax on upper-income older Americans to finance protection under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the last 13 years, 138 public laws have been enacted which changed the Internal Revenue Code,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, then commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel in February. `` We are seeing higher levels of anxiety born of frustration that comes from an inability to cope with this much change. ... Let us all catch our breath.'' Adds <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrick </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersen </PERSON> accounting firm: `` There is certainly a point _ and we've reached it _ where you ought to stop and let people at least get familiar with the law, find out whether the rules are actually working like <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> keep complaining about reduced compliance. Well, in order to comply with the rules you have to know what they are.'' Nevertheless, new law No. 139 is on the way. The 1989 tax bill being written by Ways and Means already includes more than 100 sections with many issues yet to be considered. The $ 5.3 billion pricetag makes it sound smaller than it is; in fact, the figure simply means that the bill would raise taxes $ 5.3 billion more than it would cut taxes in the budget year that begins Oct. 1. It would cut billions of dollars of taxes for many individuals and businesses and raise them by billions on others. For example, taxes on some low-income working families with children would go down because the earned-income tax credit would be liberalized. The scheduled expiration of the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance telephone service would be canceled, so phone users would lose an expected benefit. Taxes on defense contractors that use the completed-contract method of accounting would face a tax increase. Companies that increase spending for research and experimentation could continue claiming a tax credit that otherwise would expire this year. The most striking aspect of the still-developing bill is that it would roll back some recent laws that have been a major source of pride for tax-writers. Among them: _ CAPITAL GAINS: A major premise of the 1986 overhaul was that all income should be taxed alike, meaning that capital gains _ profits from the sale of investments _ should lose preferential treatment President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to restore that preference, saying it would spur the economy, and a number of Democrats are willing to go along because such a change would boost revenues for one or two years and help reduce the deficit. Democratic leaders, insisting a capital-gains cut would bloat the deficit in future years, are scrambling to devise a way to derail a capital-gains rate reduction. Some type of capital-gains change is likely, although there is general agreement it would add new complexity to the tax law. _ CATASTROPHIC: Responding to complaints from upper-income retirees, who pay most of the cost of Medicare protection against costs of catastrophic illness, the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has voted to reduce benefits and shift more of the expense to older Americans with lower incomes _ HEALTH BENEFITS: The committee has yielded to protests of businesses and agreed to eliminate from the 1986 law a requirement that employers subject their health-insurance plans to complex mathematical tests to demonstrate that they do not discriminate in favor of workers earning more than about $ 50,000 a year Instead, employers would simply have to show that a health plan is available to 90 percent of employees at a reasonable cost. _ TAX SHELTERS: With almost no debate, the committee agreed to remove an anti-tax shelter provision enacted in 1986 The change would benefit only people who make more than $ 200,000 a year and invest in low-income rental housing.

 The desert site where up to 500,000 people have cheered past space shuttle landings will be empty when <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> returns to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, closed by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for unexplained security reasons. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said the secrecy was necessary to `` to limit an adversary's ability to determine the mission of a given <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flight.'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s crew deployed an important satellite He declined to elaborate, but sources close to the project have said the 10-ton satellite is designed to snap highly-detailed photographs of military targets over a large area of the globe, including most of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Officials declined to elaborate on how national security might be harmed by opening the public viewing site for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s landing, scheduled for 9:37 EDT Sunday `` I really do n't know,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, a civilian spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> at this <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> military base.

It has been closed during classified military shuttle missions.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The agreement by Central American presidents to disband U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels has raised hopes and added momentum to the quest for peace in the region after a decade of conflict. `` We Central American presidents have taken the destiny of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in our own hands,'' said Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> after the accords were signed Aug. 7 in the Honduran port of <PERSON> Tela </PERSON>. The presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> have committed themselves to disband the 11,000 Contra rebels camped in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border by early December. The deal was sealed after the others apparently concluded <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was genuinely moving towards a fair election, as he had promised so many times in the past. Although Central American deadlines have not often been honored, the end of the eight-year-old Nicaraguan war seems to be in sight. The presidents widened the spotlight to include <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The outlook remains problematic, but the call for a cease-fire and democratic guarantees has provided the best opportunity in years for progress towards ending a conflict that began in 1980. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said the Contras should not be disbanded until after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s presidential vote, set for Feb. 25, 1990, in order to keep the heat on the leftist Sandinista government. But after eight years of fighting the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position appeared sterile. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been unwilling to approve military aid that would restore the Contras as an effective force. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> receive hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but sources at the talks said the Central Americans concluded relations would not be hurt by a decision to disband the Contras _ something that appeared inevitable in any case. Besides, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was seen as moving towards an accommodation with its domestic opposition. Just before the summit, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> obtained an agreement in which the opposition joined a call for the Contras' demise in return for promises of electoral reform. The move made <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s promises of democratization more credible, and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> sweetened the deal for <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> by agreeing to drop a world court suit against <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for abetting subversion of another government. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON>, a conservative Nicaraguan politician, attributed the eased tensions to the superpower thaw and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` perestroika,'' or economic and political restructuring. Like the Contras, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has had to deal with reduced support from his allies; on Thursday, a Soviet official told <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will ship halt arms shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as a contributioon to the peace process `` Neither side is interested in using Third World conflicts to get at the other any more,'' <PERSON> Montalvan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s most prominent leftist politician, noted that three presidents _ <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> _ are near the ends of their terms. `` They wanted to go down on the record as having achieved something concretely positive for regional peace,'' said <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, who finished a poor third to President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s voting earlier this year. <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON> predicted <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` will continue trying to block implementation of the Tela accords.'' But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will face a fight in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> if he tries to extend even non-lethal aid to the Contras in the face of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political agreements. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' popularity has been hurt by an economy that is on its way to becoming the hemisphere's worst. The government blames it on the war and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embargo. The opposition blames it on rigid economic policies. Even so, the <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> are still favored in 1990, and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has improved his odds by suspending the draft. With the Contras fading, the political benefits outweighed the military need, although occasional fighting continues in the countryside. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also have agreed to free certain political prisoners, reopen a television channel for the opposition, allow <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> election observers and yield power immediately if the opposition wins. Once the rebels are disbanded, the Tela accord calls for a wide-ranging, unconditional amnesty. The Contra leadership has been reported divided over whether to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>; some fear the fighters themselves, largely poor agricultural workers, will not want to lay down their arms. While the opposition is looking for more concessions, the business of politics has begun to pick up steam in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> estimates 1.8 million Nicaraguans will register. The opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> expressed concern about fraud, but added `` the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have absolutely renounced their ` historic project,' which involved holding on to power in order to install a dictatorship.'' The Tela accords, in addition to demobilization of the Contras, call for an end to the Salvadoran war and incorporation of the rebels into the democratic process. Both the government and the rebels hailed the accords and see improved chances for discussing peace, although there was no requirement and no verification or enforcement provision, as there is at the Nicaraguan end. The consensus among Salvadoran politicians is that resolution of the `` Contra question'' in and of itself benefits <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> by giving it attention previously monopolized by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> agreed not to aid the rebels, but Salvadorans remain skeptical about that. Although the two sides are far apart, the war has been going on for even longer than <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s, without a decisive outcome. Mere fatigue may be enough to push the sides into taking advantage of the <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION> opening.

 A fire broke out aboard a cruise ship after it collided with a pier while docking Saturday, but all 45 passengers were evacuated safely, harbor authorities said. The ship developed engine trouble when it tried to dock in heavy winds, a harbor official on this <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> island said. The wind pushed the 1,500-ton Zeus II against one of the piers, cracking its stern. Minutes later, a fire broke out in the engine room. The fire was quickly extinguished, and there was no significant damage to the engine room, said the harbor official in a telephone interview. The passengers, mostly Belgian, Dutch and German, were `` quickly and safely evacuated,'' said the official. Harbor authorities were inspecting the damage to see whether the ship could continue its cruise of the Dodecanese islands.

 For 10 years, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> and his wife were the only blacks in their Presbyterian church in <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Now <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> drives 15 miles every Sunday to a small, all-black church he attended years ago `` When you're black, your life experience makes you want a little different format,'' he says. So did the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a black priest who has been suspended by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for forming the <ORGANIZATION> Imani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, a breakaway black congregation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Unlike <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> and his followers, <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> and other blacks interviewed at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference are not breaking away from their mostly Protestant churches. But their sympathies are with <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, who was suspended by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> archdiocese after he said Mass in defiance of Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> on July 2. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has failed its nearly 2 million black parishioners. He has accused the church of racism. `` We are excited to see him have such a following, because I want to see people go back to church,'' <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters, `` I believe it would be in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s interest to understand what <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> is saying. `` If they see the African American community as important for inclusion in the church, then they have to have an appeal to that community,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said in a news conference Wednesday as the four-day meeting ended. `` They have to understand that they are in competition with traditional black churches.'' Blacks and church officials agreed that mainline <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches have avoided the Imani Temple type of schism by allowing flexibility to local congregations. `` I think most Protestant churches are far ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in terms of ritual,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Local churches are free to use the guidelines just as guidelines,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. For years, he said, he has used the hymn, `` Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' a black favorite, as the doxology in place of the traditional `` Praise God from Whom all Blessings Flow.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and a Lutheran, said concerns of blacks and minorities were a major issue in the merger of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to form the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, effective last year. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, director of education for the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and wife of a Lutheran minister, said the Lutheran church, with its German and Scandinavian underpinnings, `` has been ethnic ever since it was formed.'' But, she said, it is paying more attention to minorities `` at least in words and in policy; if this can be implemented, that will be fine.'' The issue, known in the church as inclusiveness and diversity, is expected to be debated again when the church's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> meets in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Aug. 23-30 <PERSON> Mim </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolbert </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the church's headquarters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said, `` As far as worship concerns, I think that is getting to be answered in each local congregation in a different way, depending on the situation.'' At the national office of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marj </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, director of news services, said, `` We can look back at pictures of our general assemblies even 30 years ago, and it will be all white males sitting there.'' Now the moderator, or titular head, of the church, is a black woman, the Rev. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> SamsonCampbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Still, Ms. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said, blacks `` monitor us very closely ... they call our hands quickly if we are not paying attention to their concerns.'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, a delegate from the <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> who described herself as a lifelong Baptist, said, `` I do n't think there is a trend to set up separate churches and that sort of thing because I do n't think that would solve anything. `` I think it's just a matter of people coming together and talking through their differences. At the same time, she said, she could understand the frustration that led <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> to form the breakaway church. <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, minority affairs coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said he was not unhappy at the nearly all-white church that he and his wife attended, where he had held a number of church offices, but felt he could be more useful by rejoining the all-black congregation. He said the pastor of the larger church supported his decision to resign and be `` our missionary'' to the smaller congregation. In his new church, he said, he is rediscovering the emotional climate of black worship. `` I have contact again with the old black matriarchs,'' he said. `` They are beautiful. They are something you miss. And the kids. They do their bit in the service. Tears come into your eyes when you see them in their blue pants and blue skirts and white shirts. They read the scripture, they do everything. I had gotten away from all that. `` In a black church, you have to be very, very basic,'' he said. `` Black folks have to feel it, and if you do n't make it so you can feel it, you get bored, so you say, ` Why go?'''

The other key road to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which runs southeast through the city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, has been closed intermittently, though the government has gotten convoys through guerrilla lines under military escort. For most of the 2.25 million Afghans living in this mile-high capital and facing almost daily rocket attacks by the rebels, the result of the road closures has been a sharp increase in prices on the open market, especially for flour used to make the traditional Afghan flat bread called `` nan.'' `` People are not happy,'' said <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON>, a bearded trader selling 7-pound sacks of flour at a market in western <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` They are very hungry now because food is too expensive.'' The U.S.-backed guerrillas, who are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, say soaring prices are exactly what they want. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sera </PERSON> of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-islami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Khalist </ORGANIZATION> group said the guerrilla strategy is to put pressure on the capital and force residents to evacuate, thus paving the way for attacks on the city and the ouster of the Soviet-supported government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. `` We want to make it so expensive that people leave <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sera </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` They are facing a big shortage of food.'' <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, leader of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Jamiat-e-islami </ORGANIZATION> group, said rebel factions must develop a coordinated plan to cut all roads around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in order to conquer the city. `` We must have total blockage,'' he told a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> journalist last week in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. An average Afghan worker earns about 3,500 afghanis a month, now worth less than $ 10. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials estimate prices have gone up 200 percent since Jan. 1. The closure of the <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> has made things worse: the price of a 7-pound sack of flour in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has risen from $ 1.72 on July 4 to $ 2.43 last week _ 27 percent of a typical worker's monthly salary. Meanwhile, the cost of one nan has jumped from 1 -LCB- cents to 3.6 cents. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources say that in recent weeks they have seen many <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> residents migrating north, where there are fewer rocket attacks and food is more plentiful and cheaper. `` I can say all people are facing malnutrition. All they have is one piece of bread and tea three times a day,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, a 33-year-old academic. `` I do n't know how we survive ... If the roads are blocked, we will die of hunger.'' On a recent weekend, more than 100 trucks were lined up outside <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s main silo waiting to unload grain, but it was not for immediate consumption. The government is replenishing its grain reserves to avoid a repetition of last winter's severe shortages. This grain shipment from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was transported down the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> Highway without apparent difficulty. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> said the Afghan government has reported the silo now holds about 20,000 metric tons of grain, up from just under 8,000 metric tons two weeks ago. A metric ton is equivalent to 2,205 pounds or 1.1 short tons. While the silo has a capacity of 50,000 tons, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> has said it can stockpile only about 40,000 tons for the winter, <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> said. That amount represents less than half the estimated 90,000 to 100,000 tons needed to get <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> through the three worst winter months, he said. It is n't clear yet where the rest will come from _ possibly the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> or the Soviets. Negotiations with the Soviets are under way in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> said. In the past week, the silo has been a prime target of rocket attacks. Many missed, but on one day, a rocket shattered windows and caused other minor damage. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s residents remain preoccupied with finding enough to eat. <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> said he could n't afford rice: a 7-pound sack now costs $ 4.62, a little less than half his monthly salary of $ 10.25. The biggest worry, however, is flour. `` An Afghan will be hungry unless he gets three nans every day,'' said a Western relief expert. `` This is the mainstay of the Afghan diet.''

 A man confessed he drove the family car into the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, drowning his four children, to get `` rid of his present burden,'' a detective testified at a court hearing. About 500 people gathered at a suburban <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> church this morning to pay their last respects to the four <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> children: <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, 8; <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 4; <PERSON> Kadie </PERSON>, 2; and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, 10 months. Their father, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, a 28-year-old tire store manager, was ordered held without bond Friday on four counts of first-degree murder and one of attempted murder. The Rev. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ptak </PERSON>, assistant pastor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alfred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION>, told mourners that losing the children was painful for the community as well as the family. `` This tragedy touched us in a very profound way as death has come so unnaturally and snatched from us these four children,'' <PERSON> Ptak </PERSON> said at the memorial service. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON>, 32, residents of the nearby <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, escaped from the sinking station wagon in which <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>'s father committed suicide 18 months earlier. The suspect first said a leg cramp caused him to jam the accelerator pedal, powering the car through a barricade and into the river. But on Thursday, he admitted the crash was deliberate, said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Galeski </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> told him he deliberately drove into the river `` with the intent of getting rid of his present burden, with the intent of getting rid of his wife and children.'' When the detective finished testifying, <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> briefly exchanged smiles with him. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> remained silent during the 10-minute hearing. Twenty-seventh District Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmert </PERSON> ordered him held without bond until another court appearance next Thursday. First-degree murder carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole. Attempted murder has a maximum sentence of life in prison. After the hearing, <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>'s uncle, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, said he believes his nephew is innocent. The uncle said he spoke with his nephew just before Friday's arraignment and the younger man repeated his claim the crash was accidental `` He told me he did not do this thing on purpose,'' the uncle said. `` He did not want to kill his wife. He did not want to kill his babies. I stand by what he said. `` I looked in the boy's eyes. He could n't have done it.'' He said his nephew asked how his wife was doing, and told him to `` Tell her I love her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> was not among about half a dozen family members in the courtroom. The uncle said his nephew appeared to be mentally unbalanced and unaware of his surroundings on Friday. Police told him his nephew would undergo psychiatric examination, he said. Earlier this week, the uncle disclosed that <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, shot himself to death in the same car 18 months ago. Several family members tried to persuade <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> to get rid of the car but his uncle said he urged his nephew to keep it because `` he needed the car and he did n't have a lot of money.'' `` Everybody's going to say it's a jinxed car and we should have gotten rid of it in the first place,'' the uncle said. `` But the car did n't do this again.''

<DATELINE>VERONA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In what could be a sad epilogue to a tragic love story, the balcony from which <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> pledged her love to <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> appears to be falling apart. Newspapers reported Saturday that city authorities declared the balcony dangerous and closed off an area underneath it after some tourists were hit by falling pieces of wood and rock, apparently broken loose by recent heavy rainfalls. <PERSON> Lanfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Franzoni </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION>'s museums, has said `` only a radical intervention can prevent the total collapse'' of the balcony. City officials canceled a performance of `` Romeo and Juliet'' at the site Friday night because of the precarious condition of the balcony. After another examination of the balcony on Saturday, they decided the production could continue. It closes for the season on Tuesday night. <PERSON> Alessandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Borsatti </PERSON>, a member of the acting company, said some changes had been made in the performance because of the damage but the balcony was still considered safe for the actress who plays <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>. However, he said, instead of escaping from the balcony, <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> now will flee from an adjacent window. The balcony in <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> is a place of pilgrimage for <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> fans and for romantic souls. `` Juliet's house,'' a 13th-century building in the center of town, used to be an inn called `` Il Cappello,'' or `` The Hat'' in Italian. Its name sounded close enough to <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>'s family name, <PERSON> Capulet </PERSON>, to identify it as the setting of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s play. <PERSON> Stefania </PERSON> <PERSON> Corliano </PERSON>, a guide at the house, said the city's architect supervised a group of masons Saturday who made minor repairs to the balcony She said the architect decided major repairs could wait until the fall. Newspapers reported that time and weather were not alone in causing decay of the balcony. Many of the 200,000 visitors who come yearly to <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> to remember <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON> try to break off a piece as a souvenir for their beloved.

 Residents and officials frustrated by a juvenile justice system they view as ineffective are welcoming an ordinance threatening parents with two days in a stockade if their children are caught out at night. `` I know what motivates people,'' said City Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. `` They want public approval. We sanitized crime and punishment so much that we have removed the shame. People need to see what happens when you do n't conform to the law.'' The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed the ordinance Aug. 5 after a fight early that day involving five people, some wielding broken bottles, and about 250 onlookers. The ordinance calls for a written warning to parents the first time a minor is found violating the new 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. curfew. The second time, the ordinance says, they can be fined up to $ 500 and jailed 30 days _ including up to two days on public display in a stockade _ and have their picture run in the local newspaper with the caption `` Irresponsible Parent.'' There are snags: The paper says it has n't decided whether to run such pictures. The ordinance does not specify what it means by a stockade. The town does n't have one, and the council did n't vote to build one. Supporters of the ordinance include <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannon </PERSON>, owner of the <PERSON> Dermott </PERSON> <PERSON> Pawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Shop </PERSON>. Though his business sits across the street from the police department in this southeastern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> community of 4,500, his front windows are protected with an iron grid after several break-ins. `` How about this for a stockade?'' <PERSON> Brannon </PERSON> said from behind the grid. He said the legal system does n't deal effectively with juveniles. `` There's not a whole lot you can do about them,'' <PERSON> Brannon </PERSON> said. `` It's gotten to the point where there's no embarrassment or other problems for them.'' The juveniles arrested for breaking his windows and taking merchandise were ordered to reimburse him, but have n't yet, he said. Police Chief <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said that when he's had parents and children in for conferences, other children waiting outside sometimes have yelled, `` Do n't tell them nothing. They ca n't send us to jail.'' The town's crime rate has tripled this summer mostly because of juvenile troublemakers, he said. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, who heads a seven-officer police force, said the ordinance already has shown its effectiveness. He said a parent who received a first warning told the chief to expect a child abuse call, telling him: `` I'm going to whip this child. I'm not going to jail for him.'' <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> acknowledged that many of the children committing crimes come from broken homes and are left alone by parents who must work. But he added, `` It's good they've got a job, but it does n't release them from the responsibility of being a parent.'' Whether or not sentencing parents to public display is effective, it is clearly unconstitutional, according to <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said he was sure someone would challenge the ordinance in court, and `` there's no way it'll stand up.'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> disagreed, saying the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment is a changing concept. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> of the state attorney general's office said the penalties outlined in the <PERSON> Dermott </PERSON> ordinance are unprecedented but that the idea behind them is n't. `` We have a parental liability law,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` Every state does. When a juvenile or incompetent person causes some sort of damage, the responsibility is transferred to the parent or guardian.'' <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON>, one of three parents cited under the new ordinance, said she supports it. Her 9-year-old son was caught bringing a gun to a fight between three 13-year-old girls. `` The law ai n't strict enough on the gangs and drugs and things,'' she said. `` We had to do something to get tough,'' said <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> Scucchi </PERSON>, a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Dermott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>. `` I agree with it. It may sound outlandish, but nothing has worked so far.'' <PERSON> Dedgra </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, 20, believes the answer is to punish the wrongdoers _ not the parents. `` Most of them have been in trouble before. If I were their parents, I would let them take them away,'' she said. `` Lock the kids up.''

<HEAD>Chinese May Succeed In Altering Memories of Tiananmen Square, Researcher

 The Chinese government's campaign to distort the truth about the <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> massacre may seem futile, but even eyewitnesses could one day believe they recall the fabricated history, a memory expert says. `` All the right psychological high-tech ingredients are in place for the lie to become truth, reason enough for us to be pessimistic about the future of memories of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>. `` The Chinese government is not the first set of leaders to try to rewrite history. Their attempts at mental manipulation are only the most radical in recent times. `` We should not be complacent in thinking they ca n't succeed. Rather, we should worry about whose memory is next,'' she said. <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, cited research into manipulation of eyewitness memories in an address Friday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Chinese authorities have been using memory-modifying techniques to convince citizens that violence in the army's June 4 attack on pro-democracy demonstrators was caused by rowdy civilian thugs, she said. The tactics include repeated television images of soldiers being attacked, she said. Workers, students, bureaucrats and party members are exposed to twice-weekly `` seminars'' on the topic, and make public pledges of allegiance to the party line, she said. `` People are particularly prone to having their memories modified when the passage of time allows the original memory to fade,'' <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> said. `` In its weakened condition, memory, like the disease-ridden body, becomes especially vulnerable to repeated assaults on its very essence. We are especially susceptible if we can be induced ... to repeat the misinformation as fact.'' The experiments in memory modification <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> cited generally shared a common strategy. People witnessed a crime, accident or other incident, typically on film. Sometime later, they were tested on their recall of the event. But some of the people were slipped fictitious details without their realizing it, and they later recalled them as memory. In one experiment, subjects watched a film of an accident on a country road. Later they were asked if they had seen a barn, which in fact did not appear in the film. Researchers planted that idea of a barn in the minds of some subjects by asking, `` How fast was the white sports car going when it passed the barn?'' Of the people who were asked that question, 17 percent later declared they had seen a barn. Only about 3 percent of people who had not been exposed to the leading question later said the film had included a barn. In another experiment, up to 80 percent of misled witnesses recalled planted information. People can be quite confident that they are truly remembering planted details, <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> said. `` People have recalled non-existent broken glass and tape recorders, a clean-shaven man as having a mustache, straight hair as curly,'' she said. In an interview, she acknowledged that the degree of memory distortion achieved by such experiments is far less ambitious than the goals she described for the Chinese government. But the Chinese leaders have advantages over experimenters like herself, she said. `` They have forever to do it,'' she said. `` I have only one hour. They have the resources and the opportunity to just hammer away at this in ways we have n't even begun to try in experiments. `` We present information once or twice, and people grab onto it. They can wait and let memories fade for a year. What's left, except this germ of a recollection, into which you can insert ... new ideas.'' Not everyone in her audience agreed with <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> about the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government's ability to alter memories. `` I'm not as pessimistic about the eyewitnesses,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Glucksberg </PERSON>, a psychology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` A person who was right next to a person who was shot, I do n't think his memory of that can be significantly altered,'' <PERSON> Glucksberg </PERSON> said `` I do n't think you can convince him he did not see that.'' <PERSON> Glucksberg </PERSON> said the impact on memory <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> described are real, but that nobody knows how much memories can be changed.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, in a moving salute to her husband last week, spoke of the `` virtual certainty'' he'd been killed at the hands of his Lebanese terrorist kidnappers. Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> made the announcement nearly 18 months after Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was taken captive and following an exhaustive <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> study of a videotape released by his kidnappers, which purported to show <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' body, bound and gagged and hanging from a makeshift gallows. But no corpse was made available to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials _ and a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official who traveled to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to search for the body returned empty-handed _ so it appears a formal declaration of death could be some time coming. The problem is a familiar one to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military families who struggled with uncertainty regarding the fate of their loved ones. Since World War I, the Pentagon lists approximately 92,000 troops as missing in action. Much attention has been focused recently on the 2,344 military personnel still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. `` It's a very difficult problem to deal with, emotionally and legally,'' said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> and Missing in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` This is a particularly tragic situation. It looks like Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was killed, but there's still that degree of doubt,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. The spokeswoman said Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, herself a Marine major, appeared at a recent event and sponsored by her organization and attended by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. `` Maj. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> has been very supportive of our group throughout her ordeal. ... I can see where she would gain some comfort from being with POW @ MIA -LRB- prisoner of war, missing in action -RRB- families,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. Even when there is a formal declaration of death of a loved one who has been missing, sometimes family members cling to the chance a mistake has been made, said <PERSON> Carmella </PERSON> <PERSON> LaSpada </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for a No Greater Love, a support organization for families of missing soldiers. `` Hope is a cheater. If no one knows for sure, it's always very distressing for the family,'' she said. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the decision to declare a serviceman or woman dead is up to the service secretary. In <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' case, it has been delegated to Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> `` has taken a close personal interest'' in the case and `` has taken <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> under his wing,'' said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. But before making any decision, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has indicated more work needs to be done, <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. The commandant, who personally informed Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> of the gist of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s report, has asked to see the bureau's complete written study, and has requested a personal briefing as well. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> intends to speak with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official who traveled in search of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> body, <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, and also meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' lawyers about the case. `` He also intends to speak with <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> again. There is nothing compelling him to arrive at a decision at any specified time,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. No plans have been made for any memorial service, he added. `` We really do n't know when the situation will change. Bascially, it's open-ended for now,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. There is a formal process under which a formal declaration of death is made and the families concerned are invited to participate in _ or contest _ the process, <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. Each is handled on a case-by-case basis, he said. Up until a declaration is made, the surviving spouse continues to draw the full pay and allowances due the serviceman or woman. When the declaration is made, the pay stops and `` the account is settled,'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. That includes such things as life insurance payments _ most servicemen carry the $ 50,000 group life insurance policy that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> had _ payment for any leave accrued, and payment of survivor's benefits of approximately $ 1,000 a month for life, unless the spouse decides to remarry, <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> has n't ever mentioned the financial aspects of her husbands ` situation, the spokesman `` That's been the least of her worries,'' he said.

 `` Please deposit 10 cents for the next five minutes, or your call will be interrupted.'' Clink! `` Thank you.'' No _ thank YOU, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. One hundred years ago this Sunday, the 37-year-old Gray obtained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Patent No. 408,709 for his invention, `` A Coin-Controlled Apparatus for Telephones'' _ the public pay phone. The first one was installed months later at the <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. A hundred years later, there are 2 million pay phones across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ enough to give one to every man, woman and child in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s inspiration came of necessity: His foreman at a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> factory had refused him permission to use the telephone to call his sick wife, even when he offered to pay for the call. Not everyone was convinced that the pay phone would be a winner; when busy Grand Central Terminal placed its first order, it installed just one. Now, they are everywhere. There are pay phones at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in the middle of <LOCATION> Death </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, in the El Salvadoran jungle, even on the Empress <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> paddleboat on Pleasure Island at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. The price has changed _ it was a nickel for 59 years, until it rose to a dime in 1948.

<HEAD>Toledo Civil Rights Leaders Still at Odds With City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On a Monday morning when most people were returning to work, the Rev. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and his supporters gathered at the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to remember a 16-year-old black teen-ager who drowned in the muddy water. `` He did not have to die,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said after <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, placed a wreath in the water where her son died. His death has sparked a new wave of civil rights demonstrations in this northwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who was described as afraid of water, drowned July 26 after he jumped into the river while being chased by a white <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toledo </ORGANIZATION> police officer. The prayer vigil Aug. 7 attracted 100 people who were outraged because there was about an hour's delay before fire division water rescue workers were contacted to begin a search for the boy. Rose, the most visible of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>'s civil rights leaders, promises to keep the pressure on city officials until questions surrounding the boy's death are answered. Police and fire officials say proper procedures were followed, but refuse to comment further while the investigation is pending. `` The city always takes the African-American community for fools,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` Had they told us that there was a breakdown in communication by the police and fire departments and apologized for the error, we would have understood. `` But the city never apologized to anyone. Instead, they said everyone followed proper procedures and tried to say <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> was a criminal, even though he was n't charged with anything. Instead of being conciliatory, they have been arrogant. `` We've backed down before, but not this time.'' About 17 percent of the city's 340,000 residents are black. City leaders, led by Mayor <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, have tried to meet with <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and several other key activists to defuse the unrest, but those efforts have been rebuffed. `` Every time the city wants something from us they call a meeting,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` But when we try to discuss problems facing the city _ our concerns _ they claim we're being unreasonable.'' Ms. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said the point of meeting is to move beyond rhetoric and start dealing with issues. `` I think it's time that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and everyone else starts considering the safety and concerns of all of our citizens in this community and that we work together in building positive relationships,'' she said. Since the early 1970s, an advocacy group has been monitoring the hiring practices of the city's police and fire departments, which are under federal court order to hire more minorities. Racial tensions flared in June 1988 after City Manager <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkey </PERSON>, who is white, dismissed one black official and suspended two other blacks he accused of mismanaging the city's housing programs. After public hearings late last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the city signed an agreement July 28 that <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON> will hire and promote more minorities and women. A report on <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>'s race relations is pending from the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, also as a result of those hearings. In March, controversy over sexist and racist remarks allegedly made by Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON> brought many white leaders into the movement. <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON> was suspended for 20 days for making a sexist remark about a female city employee. Later, the city released a 1982 report that said firefighters heard <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON> praise <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and support lynching blacks. <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON> rarely talks publicly about the allegations, which he has denied. He did not return a telephone message last week seeking additional comment. `` A lot of the prejudice is intangible,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` The kind of prejudice in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> is n't like the segregation in the South. Many people in the white community could n't put their fingers on why we felt the way we did. Then they saw <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON>, his attitude and the city's unwillingness to take any action. Now they know.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' drowning opened new wounds. Authorities say he jumped into the river to elude officers pursuing him and three others suspected of trying to steal several cases of soda from a convenience store near the University of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>. The other suspects were not apprehended. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> had been white, rescuers would have been sent much sooner. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' civil rights were violated before he jumped in the rain-swollen river. <PERSON> Hawkey </PERSON> said a report on the incident should be complete soon. He said police and fire personnel followed procedures. Councilman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, who is black, said the drowning made more people aware of racial tension in the city. `` I suspect the death of the young man not only has brought concern in the black community, but in the greater community,'' he said. `` I think there's going to be some deep changes that have to be made very quickly for it to be turned around.''

<HEAD>Search Fails to Find Congressional Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supported by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters and more manpower, searchers stepped up the hunt Saturday for Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and his delegation. But a fifth day passed with no sign of the party's downed plane. Four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopters joined the growing fleet of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Ethiopian aircraft looking for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and 15 others, missing since Monday when their twin-engine airplane disappeared on a flight to a refugee camp. The <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawks </ORGANIZATION>, ferried across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> by a C-5 cargo plane, were assembled in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> on Friday and took to the air at dawn, joining more than a dozen other aircraft. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said three more C-130 Hercules cargo planes were to arrive Sunday, supplementing two already taking part in the search that began Tuesday. The helicopters were dispatched to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s press secretary in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> criticized the search effort Friday as lacking `` a sense of urgency. `` There's an obvious leadership or organizational vacuum here,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, told a news conference. `` We could have and should have located them by now.'' But weary officials in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s capital defended their efforts. `` We feel we have adequate resources,'' said <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>. `` However, if the requirements of the operation increase, we are prepared to increase both the equipment and the manpower.'' The twin-engine Twin Otter disappeared Monday on a flight from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> to the Fugnido refugee camp, 480 miles to the southwest near the Sudanese border. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunger </ORGANIZATION>, was one of nine Americans aboard the flight. Earlier this week, weather satellites detected what appeared to be distress signals from aircraft in two areas outside the Leland plane's intended flight path, but nothing was found when rescuers searched those areas. The C-130s due to arrive Sunday were bringing crews to spell the fliers of the first two Hercules, who have been in the air from sunup to sundown each day since their arrival on an overnight flight from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> described as `` superb'' the cooperation of the Ethiopians, with whom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has had chilly relations since a Marxist government came to power in a 1974 coup. `` The Ethiopians have put up to 10 aircraft up in a day,'' he said. `` You got a heck of a lot of people out there looking for the missing aircraft. We've got the local authorities also helping on the ground.'' The government in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> has allowed an American U2, a high-altitude reconnaisance craft commonly used for spy missions, to make daily passes over its territory, taking high-resolution photographs of the search area. `` I think there is an honest difference of opinion among people equally committed to finding the aircraft,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, the embassy's chief spokesman. `` Rescue people here are deciding on what they consider adequate resources.'' Two of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s colleagues, Reps. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, flew in the fleet of four <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawks </ORGANIZATION> that spent the day scouring the first 100 miles of the intended flight path of downed plane. The two C-130s and a number of Ethiopian planes covered the remainder of the path. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s committee, and <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, who belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, were sent to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to represent the lower chamber. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> has made six trips to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, the last one just last March. As chairman of the select committee, he long has expressed intense interest in the problems of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s displaced and hungry. The Fugnido camp is one of four camps in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. It houses more than 300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and civil war in their neighboring country. The eight other Americans traveling with <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> included three members of his staff, a friend of the congressman, three officers from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and the spouse of one of the AID officials. Also aboard were an Ethiopian employee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, three Ethiopian officials and a crew of three.

 About 200 people chanting `` drug dealers got to go'' followed the hearse of a slain anti-drug activist this morning through the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> neighborhood she tried to make safer for her family. The two-mile procession followed a funeral Mass at which <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 34, was praised for her courage. `` She, with her family, attempted to create a place where all of us may be able to live with dignity. And then that dream and that vision was tragically and dramatically shattered,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ploch </PERSON>. Three mayoral candidates joined those who packed <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> for the funeral. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who received a death threat during his wife's wake on Friday, was in the front of the church with two of the couple's three children. Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> was shot Tuesday by a gunman who fired at least five bullets into her family's apartment. She died six hours later. She and her husband had confronted drug dealers in their neighborhood, and the killing is seen in the community as retaliation for their efforts. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> has vowed to continue the fight. `` Those most important to the elimination of the drug scourge are people like <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>,'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` The rest of this city should stand up and say to them, ` You are not alone.''' After the funeral, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s leading challenger in November's election, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, and about two dozen <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> joined the group marching to <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> for Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s On Friday, a wake for Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> was interrupted when someone called in a bomb threat at a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> funeral home. Police said a small number of mourners were evacuated while bomb-sniffing dogs went through the home, but nothing was found. Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s husband had not yet arrived at the home when the search took place, said a funeral home spokesman. Services resumed after police found no evidence of a bomb, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said. Police, meanwhile, are investigating a feud between the <ORGANIZATION> Hernandezes </ORGANIZATION> and their next-door neighbors. A grand jury Thursday indicted one of the neighbors, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 42, who last month allegedly stabbed <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> after the <ORGANIZATION> Hernandezes </ORGANIZATION> accused him of selling cocaine in front of their house. He is also accused of threatening <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> with an Uzi submachine gun. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was arrested for both incidents on Aug. 4 and was in jail when Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> was killed, police said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a statement Saturday marking the 28th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, said he hoped for a positive Soviet response to make <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> `` a place of cooperation, not a point of confrontation.'' `` We observe this sad anniversary with renewed determination to overcome the division of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the statement from Camp David, Md.

<HEAD>Polish Prime Minister Calls For Meeting With Walesa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, whose efforts to form a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> have been opposed by Solidarity, called Saturday for a meeting with <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to discuss the standoff and the concerns it has raised in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In an interview published by the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` simply can not afford a protracted impasse.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> also said two small Communist-aligned political parties that have entered into negotiations with officials of the Solidarity movement should remain loyal to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s public appeal for a meeting appeared to indicate a decision by communist authorities that the time has come to end the political jockeying and hammer out an agreement with Solidarity on the form of the next government. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> announced Monday he would oppose any Cabinet assembled by <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. The Solidarity leader has been trying to forge alliances with the two minor parties, who hold the parliamentary power balance, in order to form a Solidarity-led government in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc ally. Talks between Solidarity and the minor parties, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peasants </LOCATION> and the Democrats, began Thursday. A spokesman for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Paczek </PERSON>, said Saturday he was not sure if <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was aware of <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s call for a meeting. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was unavailable for comment, and <PERSON> Paczek </PERSON> said no meeting would take place before Monday. In the year since Communist authorities resumed dialogue with Solidarity, meetings between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> at various government villas around <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> were the scene of key compromises. Such meetings took place before and during the `` round table'' talks that led to legalizing the union, rewriting the constitution and admitting the opposition to parliament. Given the opposition's overwhelming victories in June elections, both opposition and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> politicians have argued that Solidarity's endorsement is required for the next government to have public support. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has expressed impatience with the political situation, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> met Friday with <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Malinowski </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jozwiak </PERSON>. The discussions with the party chairmen, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said, concerned the progress of reforms and establishing direct links between the minor parties and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A Soviet Foreign Ministry official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday criticized attempts to use the formation of the Polish government `` for destabilizing the situation in the country,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The official, First Deputy <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON>, did not mention Solidarity by name, but the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership also has referred to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s bid as destabilizing. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said that any attempts to undermine the country's stability and willingness to carry out its agreements under the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance `` would not promote the interests of stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In the interview, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> was asked about <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s bid to form a government in place of him. `` I would not treat the failure of <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>'s mission as a personal tragedy,'' he said. `` However, this is not exclusively my personal matter. That is why I would not be able to neglect the effects of a government crisis.'' He said he has been `` unable'' to arrange substantive talks with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> since being named prime minister Aug. 2. `` I would like such a talk to take place as soon as possible,'' he said. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said the Peasant and Democratic parties owe loyalty to his communist <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` In politics, delivering on agreements and loyalty should be values that are respected,'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> said. `` The political contract reached at the ` round table' guaranteed the vital political interests'' of the two parties. Noting the Peasants and the Democrats owe the number of seats they have in parliament to a deal made with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and that the parties entered elections as communist allies, he said: `` I think this ... obliges one.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who said he hopes to present his Cabinet for approval by the parliament in late August, stressed he has not given up on the idea of forming a government that would have both the opposition and communists in it. `` Unfortunately,'' he said, Solidarity lawmakers `` reject direct participation in the government.'' But he added, `` I am not giving up hope that the supreme reasons will prevail after all and a chance will surface for the formation of agovernment of national agreement. The offer still stands.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> astronauts tested the shuttle's flight control systems on their last full day in orbit as they prepared to end their secret military mission with a morning landing Sunday in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> desert. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> briefly broke a Pentagon-imposed news blackout Saturday to announce that <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> would land at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, at 9:37 a.m. EDT. The space agency previously had said only that the shuttle would land sometime between 9 a.m. and noon Sunday. `` The crew is doing well and is beginning landing preparations,'' a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The announcement was one of just a few made this week about the semisecret mission. Sunday's weather forecast called for excellent landing conditions at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>. Skies were to be partly cloudy and temperatures were expected to range from 68 degrees just after sunrise to a midday high of 97 degrees. Although hundreds of thousands of people have flocked to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base to watch previous shuttles land in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, Sunday's touchdown will be closed to the public because of the classified nature of the flight. The planned private landing was a fitting finale to the flight, which has been cloaked in secrecy from the start. The news blackout was imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to keep the mission's activities a secret. To prepare for the trip back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> were running through a series of tests Saturday to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready. In addition, mission specialists <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> were packing up the experiments. Some of those tests were believed to be connected with the `` Star Wars'' missile defense project, while others involved determining how people can serve as military observers from space. During their mission, the five military men also reportedly monitored military tactical and strategic targets on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The main goal of the flight was widely believed to be the deployment of a sophisticated, 10-ton spy satellite that is designed to snap highly detailed photographs over a wide area of the globe, including most of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> confirmed Wednesday that a satellite was deployed by the astronauts during their first day in orbit, but he would n't discuss its purpose.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, suffered a stroke in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and was flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for treatment, sources in the organization were quoted as saying Saturday. A spokesman for the British company <ORGANIZATION> Lonrho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> was flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on a company plane but would not say which hospital was treating the 71-year-old black nationalist leader or describe his condition. Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoted sources in the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as saying <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> was stricken Wednesday and flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Friday for treatment at a private hospital. They were quoted as saying he was absent during a summit in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> Thursday involving the presidents of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla organization fighting the white-run government in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The British Foreign Office could not immediately confirm the report. The <ORGANIZATION> Lonrho </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking anonymously, said the aircraft had been in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> for another reason and that action had been taken to help <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> after a request `` from African governments.'' The Lonhro spokesman said he did not know how long <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> would be in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or whether the company would provide him with a flight back to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. Of the decision to use the <ORGANIZATION> Lonhro </ORGANIZATION> plane, he said: `` There was no hesitation. It was a matter of some considerable concern that he should be got back to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as soon as possible. The plane was coming in this direction anyway.'' <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> since 1967, has been in exile since <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> banned the organization in 1960. His longtime friend and jailed former <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> partner <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said in a note from prison in 1985: `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> is much more than a brother to me. He is my greatest friend and comrade for nearly 50 years.'' <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> is believed to command wide respect from others in the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s exiled leadership, but there are persistent reports that two factions will vie for power once he is gone. A more militant faction, headed by <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> military chief of staff <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hani </PERSON>, has favored continuing or escalating sabotage and bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, including attacks on civilian targets. The more moderate faction, favoring diplomacy, is led by <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign affairs secretary, who has been mentioned frequently as a likely successor to <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>.

<HEAD>World's Biggest Arts Festival Ponders Future in 43rd Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The flags are flying in <LOCATION> Princes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> and the capital is bustling with the first of 250,000 visitors to the world's biggest arts extravaganza beginning Sunday. But as the three-week Edinburgh Festival of music, theater and dance opens, organizers are asking what the future holds for the 43-year-old chronically underfunded event. A policy committee has been set up for the first time to discuss wider issues than what shows to put on, including the festival's direction in the next 10 years, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>, festival director for the last seven years `` It seems to me that unless it can be creatively expanded and look at itself afresh, it will become moribund,'' he said in an interview, adding, `` I do n't think I'm becoming moribund, although some might think I am.'' <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> is a short, stocky, gray-bearded Englishman, the son of a Polish-Latvian shoemaker's daughter and a Scottish engineer. He was associate director of the National Theater under <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, founded the Young <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> youth theater and worked in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as a successful director. He searches constantly for unexpected delights for the festival, including in other years a hilarious Canadian comedy about old movies and a Japanese `` Macbeth'' performed in white body stockings. This year has much that is <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> opera, puppets, ballet, theater and the National Orchestra of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> said he had n't had time to read one prominent <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper article suggesting he is ready to quit because he was dispirited about the future of the festival. Money is a continual problem. The Edinburgh Festival has always been underfunded and the city fathers never built the opera house that was pledged after World War II. `` I spend more time appealing for money than anything else,'' says <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>. `` The festival is costing $ 4.8 million this year, and we should be spending $ 6.4 million.'' Festival visitors will spend at least $ 64 million in the next three weeks, but the city _ especially its businesses _ is notoriously parsimonious, he said. Local authorities and the government this year will provide around $ 2 million in subsidies and commercial sponsors give another $ 800,000. The rest comes from the box office, advertising revenue and sales. In the last month, <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> was stunned when the festival found itself $ 16,000 short of the money needed to set up an exhibition about tartan history and fashion, sponsored by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trust fund. `` Not a single Scottish sponsor was interested, but we finally scraped it together,'' he said. Still, he said, `` We know that <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> wants the festival despite the hunger of <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to kidnap it and the sniping from down south that <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> does n't deserve it.'' <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON> said in the past five years the festival has become more international, with companies from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> participating. This year the festival also includes the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> dance company from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We now must try to get the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and Central Americans here. It must become a festival of innovation if it is to make progress,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shiite Cleric Says Hostage Issue Will Meet `Rational Solution'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's most influential Shiite Moslem cleric said Saturday the hostage issue will `` move in the direction of a rational solution.'' But he warned it could take a long time, and any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military move would backfire. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> made his comments in an interview with the Moslem-run radio Voice of the Nation a day after he offered to help free Western hostages if Western countries helped release Arab prisoners in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> is spiritual guide to the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The group is believed to be the umbrella organization for underground factions holding most of the Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Asked to comment on reports of a planned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action if another <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostage is killed, <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said: `` This will not achieve anything but will endanger the hostages for whom the war is waged and will increase the possibilities of what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> calls terrorism. `` We believe that any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> military action will backfire and may provoke revolutionary elements opposed to the American policy in the region,'' he said. `` Therefore, the issue will move in the direction of a rational solution that may take a long time, but it will not move at all in a military atmosphere, at least in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interests,'' he added. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent warships to the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and to waters near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the height of the latest hostage crisis. The crisis developed after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> abducted a Hezbollah-affiliated cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on July 28. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> has since confessed to helping plan attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and to the 1988 abduction of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeper in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> claimed it hanged <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on July 31 because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refused to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. However, some reports say he was killed months earlier. Another group, the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said it would kill American hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> if <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> was not released. However, it later said it had granted <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> a reprieve, and offered to free him if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and 450 Arab prisoners and also let 55 Palestinian deportees return to the occupied lands. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has said any swap must include three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In his remarks Saturday, <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> also accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` prolonging the detention'' of the hostages. `` America could have resolved this problem realistically through deep, quiet diplomacy ... But instead it has worked on prolonging the period of their detention because it found out it could use the hostage issue in its ... war against terrorism,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said. On Friday, <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said, `` Let us get to an agreement together so that each side would use his own means and influence to end the crisis of the hostages _ all hostages _ and resolve the problem of Arab prisoners,'' he said. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s statement was worth noting. Among the 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, one Irishman and one Italian. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

 An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> priest whose writings and broadcasts outraged former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has won the 1989 <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Magsaysay </PERSON> award for Journalism, <ORGANIZATION> Literature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, it was announced Saturday. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertram </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was praised for `` employing his gifts as writer, theatrical director and broadcaster, but most of all as teacher to make the performing arts and media a vital force for the good of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.'' Reuter, 73, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, began directing plays in 1941 and wrote scripts for a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio program. During World War II, he wrote songs and skits to rally fellow inmates at Japanese prison camps in the country. He was ordained in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1946 and returned to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to teach journalism, write and direct art productions. He introduced Catholic programming on television and helped set up the church's radio station, <ORGANIZATION> Veritas </ORGANIZATION>. When <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> declared martial law in 1972, <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON> was arrested for criticizing the government. In the 1986 presidential elections, <ORGANIZATION> Reuter </ORGANIZATION> and several other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> broadcasters counted ballots on their own to guard against fraud. Weeks later, in the ensuing military revolt that toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year government and catapulted <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency, <PERSON> Reuter </PERSON> helped keep <ORGANIZATION> Veritas </ORGANIZATION> on the air so Filipinos could be informed about what was happening The award, bestowed by the <ORGANIZATION> Ramon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magsaysay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, will be presented on Aug. 31, the 82nd birthday of the popular Philippine president who died in a plane crash in 1957 and whose name the foundation bears.

<TEXT>
 Although <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s humor is a chief reason for his enduring popularity, several scholars meeting to commemorate one of the author's least humorous novels said <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s brooding side will also help keep him relevant to future generations `` I think people are figuring out that they ca n't some day say, ` Well, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>, he's out of it. He was just a mindless optimist,''' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and editor of the `` Journal of American Literature.'' `` People do know there was a darker and more irreverent side to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> was among about 150 literary scholars and <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> fans attending a three-day conference sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Elmira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at Quarry Farm to mark the 100th anniversary of the publication of `` A <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> in King Arthur's Court. The conference, held Thursday, Friday and Saturday in the city where <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> is buried, showed how popular the author remains 79 years after his death. `` Only a few years ago, academic types like myself were polled on who was the greatest American writer and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> came out No. 1,'' said <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> professor and <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> biographer. `` Now, in fact, I've almost never known an ordinary person who's read a whole lot of <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>,'' he said `` But <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> is recognized by professors as a very great writer at the same time ordinary people do, too. <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s different from any other American writer because he's liked by ordinary people.'' Indeed, debates continued throughout the conference about the meaning and significance of `` A <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>'' as if the novel had appeared in 1989 instead of 1889. The novel concerns an imaginary trip to 6th-century <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> factory mechanic who uses his knowledge of electricity and other `` modern'' technology to seize control of the court. While the first third of the book is mostly a farce about the customs of medieval <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the inconveniences of living in that age, the novel takes on a more ominous tone in its final two-thirds. It ends with a bloody battle in which thousands of knights are slaughtered with the help of such 19th century refinements as electricity and <PERSON> Gatling </PERSON> guns. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Crews </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> professor, said the ending of the book `` stuns and chills us.'' `` Only a few critics have been able to talk themselves out of the sense that something has gone terribly wrong, not only with the book but also with <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>,'' he told conference participants. Many critics have seen the darkness of the latter part of `` A <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>'' as presaging the final two troubled decades of <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s own life, when a series of financial and personal setbacks prompted a string of bitter, misanthropic writings. <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> referred to this stage of the author's life as the `` late, atheistic, outrageous <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>.'' Still, Crews and most other experts at the conference agreed that many passages in `` A <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>'' exhibit the kind of homespun wit and humor <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> became famous for in `` The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' and other books. `` It has the makings of a classic,'' he said of `` A <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>.'' According to <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s reputation has profited from the added attention the author has received from centennial celebrations of `` Huckleberry Finn'' in 1985 and `` A <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> Yankee'' this year. `` You must know the worst thing that could happen to a writer is to be forgotten,'' he said. `` No one has forgotten this guy.''

 Soviet fans jumped, danced and wrapped themselves in giant <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags Saturday as some of heavy metal's biggest stars made their Soviet debut in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s biggest-ever hard rock concert. The benefit concert, a two-day extravaganza billed as the `` Moscow Music Peace Festival'' and likened to the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> festival of 20 years ago, features Western musicians <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crue </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>, Scorpions, <PERSON> Cinderella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ozzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osbourne </PERSON>, and Skid Row as well as the Soviet groups Nuance, <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brigada </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Proceeds </PERSON> will go to programs that fight drug and alcohol abuse in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. About 100,000 fans filled the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Saturday, many of them reclining on mats or jumping and screaming near the stage, painted in the psychedelic style of the 1960s. Some fans wrapped themselves in giant <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and formed human pyramids. `` We're athletes, we need some psychological relaxation!'' a member of the Soviet junior fencing team shouted after the pyramid he was forming with teammates toppled. The concert's Soviet organizer, impressario <PERSON> Stas </PERSON> <PERSON> Namin </PERSON>, told a news conference Friday the concert would be as important to his generation as <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> was to American youth in 1969. `` We will show that rock is not just negative,'' he said. `` After so many years of stigmatization, this is something positive,'' At $ 16 a ticket, the concert was exorbitantly priced by Soviet standards. However, organizers said it quickly sold out. `` This is the first time we've ever had such a concert,'' said 23-year-old <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Viklova </PERSON>, who came with her husband. `` There was no way we could pass up the chance. We came to see the foreign groups.'' Rock promoter <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kisilev </PERSON> said the concert represented a major step forward from two years ago, when <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> authorities banned a proposed anti-drug concert because `` they said we did n't have a drug problem, and our rock was not developed enough. Soviet authorities no longer emphatically condemn rock music as a decadent Western force, but officials still occasionally express disapproval of rock culture. Few hard rock albums are put out in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and groups have generally had a hard time making arrangements for concert halls and tours. They have, however, gained ground under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s cultural thaw. Any parallel with <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, the outdoor festival at a farm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state that became a symbol of the 1960's, escaped many of Saturday's fans. One 18-year-old Muscovite asked whether <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> had been held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kisilev </PERSON> said the weekend's concert could change the Soviet rock scene and serve as a precedent for more such events. One fan at the concert was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, who gave an impromptu press conference wearing one of the `` Just Say Nyet'' buttons promoters had distributed. The buttons mirrored the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-drug slogan `` Just Say ` No.''' `` These contacts show we have common goals and common problems,'' <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> said as he posed for photos with long-haired rockers <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittingham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Courey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cinderella </LOCATION>. The concert will spawn an album dedicated to rock stars who died of overdoses. American viewers will be able to see four hours of performances on cable television Sunday, organizers said.

<HEAD>Indian Peacekeepers Kill 51 Civilians After Attack, Tamils Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Indian peacekeeping troops killed at least 51 civilians and set homes and shops on fire after being attacked by ethnic Tamil rebels in a northern town, Tamil sources said Saturday. The Sri Lankan government, which has been trying to persuade <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to pull out its soldiers, said it has begun an investigation into the killings. The Tamil sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in addition to killing the civilians, the Indians set fire to 40 homes and 23 shops. A rebel group claimed at least 70 civilians were killed, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> reported 18 civilians dead. The Indian patrol was ambushed Aug. 2 in the town of <LOCATION> Velvettiturai </LOCATION>, about 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. At least six soldiers were killed in the attack, Indian military officials said at the time. A Sri Lankan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said the investigation was ordered after Tamil lawmakers in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> raised the issue. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government was considering a request that a parliamentary group be sent to the area to investigate. The Tamil sources quoted residents as saying the Indian troops imposed a 48-hour curfew on Velvettiturai after the ambush and carried out search operations. Many houses were shelled, and several of the civilian casualties were burned to death, they said. They said 51 victims were identified by relatives after the curfew was lifted. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the rebel group fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement telexed to newspaper offices from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that at least 70 civilians had been killed in the offensive. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' accounts of casualties have proved to be exaggerated in the past. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said there were 18 civilians killed in an exchange of gunfire between soldiers and rebels after the ambush. He said 12 rebels and rebel supporters were killed. The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rebels used civilians as a cover while firing rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles at the Indian army patrol. Indian soldiers were sent to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Tamil-dominated north and east two years ago to put down a Tamil war for an independent homeland. They were deployed initially to supervise an Indian-sponsored peace plan that called for the government to give Tamils limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> rejected the agreement and turned their guns on the Indians. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> got involved in the ethnic problems of this nation off its southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause. President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> had asked <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to withdraw its soldiers by July 29 to appease Sinhalese militants who object to the Indian presence as well as the Tamil rebels. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, however, said a quick withdrawal could lead to more violence. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has instead said it will withdraw its more than 40,000 soldiers in phases. It says they will all be out by February. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. They say they suffer discrimination by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government. Militant Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983. At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed since then.

 A classified section of the soon-to-be released national drug strategy calls for an expansion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military training for local forces in three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries and allocates $ 300 million for anti-drug efforts, an administration source says. `` Given that they now receive pocket change, it could be a tripling'' of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expenditures for the world's largest cocaine-producing countries: <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already provides some military training of local forces in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, but not to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in campaign speeches, called for stepped up actions against drugs at their South American origins. But such attempts have been largely unsuccessful because of guerrilla wars, economic problems and a lack of resources. The administration official stressed that the proposal calls for more training of troops, not for actual military operations by American forces. Also, the local governments would have to request the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces overseas. `` There's nothing unilateral contemplated,'' the source said. The proposal is in a classified section of the drug strategy drafted by national drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is reviewing all international and interdiction proposals. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to present the final package to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 5. Although some aspects of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s proposed strategy have triggered some bickering between agencies, a source said there has been `` no opposition to expanding training'' by the military. Special Forces troops currently train forces in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, and a source said the expansion contemplated would be `` building on the number of people we have down there.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned that `` increased military involvement in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> anti-drug efforts must be treated extremely carefully. Any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military involvement must be through multilateral efforts such as the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, and must be welcomed by the country involved.'' The proposal was derided by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION>, who said `` $ 300 million for countries that are very beleaguered, whose economies are in a shambles, that's a spit in the ocean That's tokenism, that's what it is.'' Giving those countries more aid would work `` only if they are capable of utilizing it,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in an interview Friday from his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> office. `` ... Most of these countries have not had the ability to digest more aid. They do n't have the troops. They do n't have the expertise. The commitment of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers, equipment and economic aid should be dependent on the recipient countries committing their own military forces to the anti-drug effort, something they have done only on rare occasions, he said. `` I'll be happy to give all that to them if they'll tell me they'll let the military loose to get involved in eradication,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> took a somewhat different position, saying, `` Merely increasing anti-narcotics assistance without development of a comprehensive plan that addresses the economic and social needs of drug-producing countries will not succeed. `` In addition to crop eradication, we must improve assistance for law enforcement, make provisions for income alternatives for illicit narcotics crop cultivation, and consider whether debt and trade incentives are needed as part of an effective anti-narcotics strategy,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. Capitol <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s lack of access to copies of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s proposed strategy has prompted some displeasure among members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, particularly those who are actively involved in drug issues. Both <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said they based their comments on news reports of what the strategy proposes. The draft strategy was distributed to a select few officials in each of the federal agencies involved in anti-drug efforts, and they were directed to keep it confidential. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said they and other chairmen of congressional committees concerned with drug matters met with <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> last week. `` He asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to take seriously all the stories appearing in the press about the contents of the proposed strategy,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said in a statement. `` He told us he is presently ` bouncing ideas' off the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. He asked us to reserve comment until the report is approved by the president and released.'' Among other things, <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said the strategy will be meaningful only if the president calls for full funding of its proposals. `` The strategy will be pure rhetoric and will become a broken administration promise if real dollars, not just the words in this plan, are not provided,'' he said. `` You ca n't say you're going to declare war and provide no money for the bullets.''

 <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> eased into the gun turret, adjusting his helmet and closing the hatch over his head. As his buddy, <PERSON> Nels </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, positioned their tank, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> reached for his ammunition _ a bucket of racquetballs. As he took aim at another tank, the high school freshman joined hundreds of others in what has become this summer's hottest amusement park attraction _ Tank Tag. `` It's addictive,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 14, of <LOCATION> Sudbury </LOCATION>, as he and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> prepared for their sixth ride in the tanks at the <ORGANIZATION> Millbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amusement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, about 35 miles west of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` It's a lot more realistic than a computer game,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 33, a computer programmer from <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, `` and you ca n't get hurt.'' The country's newest war game has sprung up at about 20 amusement parks, including ones in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and dozens of others are expected to follow suit. Tank Tag's popularity has soared since it surfaced in <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, last summer. It was invented by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plarr </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Dorney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wildwater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>. `` It's like being in World War II without getting hurt,'' said <PERSON> Plarr </PERSON>. `` It's just like the gladiators in Roman times. This is the first time in history you're part of a shooting gallery.'' More than 150 amusement park owners from around the world have scheduled visits to the <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION> facility this month to inspect Tank Tag as a potential attraction for their own parks, according to <LOCATION> Plarr </LOCATION>. He said a group of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> visited last week to see if they could install Tank Tag and a water war game at some of the former Olympic Games sites in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Plarr </PERSON>, a former Marine who addresses everyone as `` sir'' or `` ma'am,'' expanded his basic tank game idea to the water games. The tag game uses two to four small-scale, computerized, made-to-order tanks that are mounted on tires instead of treads and powered by hydraulic <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> engines. The tanks, which <PERSON> Plarr </PERSON> says cost from $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 each, are designed for two people _ one who `` drives'' the tank by pressing a gas-powered pedal on the floor and the other seated in the turret. Each pays $ 4.50 a ride. The game includes 10 simulated guns placed along the perimeter of the Tank Tag area. Participants who choose not to ride on the tanks can stay behind the protective netting and fire balls, paid for by the bucket, at the tanks. The balls shot from a tank turret or from one of the outside guns can go at 60 mph. `` I think it's kind of cute,'' said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Suhl </PERSON>, 38, who watched her son, <PERSON> Josh </PERSON>, 9, fire at the tanks from the perimeter. `` It's a bigger version of Nintendo.'' The only restriction on participants is height _ you must be at least 4 -LCB- feet tall to crawl inside a tank. In <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, more than 50 percent of the participants are women and children, said <PERSON> Plarr </PERSON>. Plarr avoids comment on the paramilitary aspects of Tank Tag. He prefers to view the game as the heir to the carnival shooting gallery of the past and as testament to a new demand for participatory games. `` People want to touch, feel, taste. They do n't want to be put in a car. They want to drive themselves,'' said <PERSON> Plarr </PERSON>. `` This is a do-it-yourself ride.''

<HEAD>Bomb Doesn't Dampen Protestant Parade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb was barely noticed Saturday as thousands of drum-banging Protestants celebrated a victory over a Catholic king three centuries ago. But the explosion that wrecked a bar four hours before the Apprentice Boys' Parade, causing no injuries, underlined tensions as <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> approaches the 20th anniversary of the British government's decision to send in troops. It was the Apprentice Boys' Parade in 1969 that touched off rioting in Roman Catholic areas and led to troops arriving in the province on Aug. 14, 1969. Saturday's bomb, said marcher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, `` means we have no security.'' `` For the amount of money they're spending, we should get better security,'' said <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, who drove 60 miles from his farm near <LOCATION> Dungannon </LOCATION> to join the parade. `` -LRB- The bomb -RRB- was only a small sample of what we've had,'' added <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. Police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 a.m. in a Butcher Street bar. It had been discovered by security forces who evacuated the area, but it exploded before army experts could defuse it, said a spokesman who refused to be named. The explosion shattered glass in the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall, but no one was hurt. `` It will not stop us. It will not dampen our spirits in any way,'' said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, general secretary of the Apprentice Boys organization. A statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said the bomb was timed to go off when security forces were in the area. By planting the device, the statement said, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> proved it could strike despite heavy security. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> seeks to drive the British out of the province. On Friday night, police said they seized a bomb packed with 10 pounds of Semtex plastic explosives and arrested two men in the Catholic Creggan neighborhood of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>. There was heavy security along the parade route across the broad <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Foyle </LOCATION> and through the picturesque walled city, with dozens of gray armored police vehicles in the streets and soldiers patrolling in full combat gear. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> police force, however, reported that the parade pased without incident. Before the parade, a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, told worshipers at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columb </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> it would be wrong to provoke sectarian passions. `` Rather we should endeavor to teach our fellow countrymen to look at the past in a calm and kindly spirit, to rise superior to the passions of the ages ...'' <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said. The parade was a rich mixture of politics and religion, with bands marching to such tunes as `` Abide with Me'' and `` Stand Up, Stand Up for <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>'' to a martial beat. <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> has long been a place of mythic significance to Protestants as the scene of a 15-week siege in 1689 by the forces of the exiled Catholic King <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who had been ousted in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch-born prince who ruled <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> jointly with his English wife and cousin, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. The `` no surrender'' spirit of the apprentice boys who slammed the city gates to prevent their leader from capitulating lives on as a political slogan for the so-called Loyalist side _ the large segment of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> community that supports British rule. Aug. 12 is the day the siege was lifted. <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> was a focus of the Catholic civil rights marches of the 1960s because of the blatant gerrymandering that perpetuated the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> minority's control of local government. Even the name is contentious: to loyalists it is <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, to nationalists it is <LOCATION> Derry </LOCATION>. Once Catholics gained control of the local council, it became the <ORGANIZATION> Derry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community plans its own march Monday evening, followed by a speech by <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON> <PERSON> McAliskey </PERSON>, a prominent firebrand of the <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> movement in the 1960s. The current <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> campaign dates from the turbulent days after British troops arrived. The Provisional Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> broke away from the old <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> organization to wage guerrilla war on the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and other targets. British troops in the province currently number more than 10,000, compared a peak of 22,000 at the height of the violence in 1972. They are backed by 6,500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regiment </ORGANIZATION>, a locally recruited unit of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Since the troops arrived, more than 2,700 people have been slain.

 A singer and two crew members with LL Cool J's rap band were charged with raping a 15-year-old girl who attended an after-concert party after going backstage on a pass won in a radio contest. The girl told authorities that six to eight men taunted her during the assault and made comments such as, `` When's it going to be our turn?'' Singer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 26, and band technician <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, 22, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and bodyguard <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsipouras </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, were charged Friday with first-degree criminal sexual conduct, said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> attorney. LL Cool J, whose real name is <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, was not involved in the incident after Wednesday night's concert and did not meet the 15-year-old, police said. He and the rest of his group were continuing their three-month national tour. They three who were charged were being held Saturday at the <LOCATION> Hennepin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail under $ 100,000 bail each. They were scheduled for court appearances Monday, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The felony is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $ 35,000 fine. `` We're going to try to find out who else was in the room,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` If we can learn who they are, they could be charged, too,'' as accomplices. The girl and a 16-year-old female friend received backstage passes along with tickets to Wednesday's concert when one of them won a radio station's contest. They accompanied group members in a limousine to <LOCATION> L'Hotel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sofitel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> for the party on Tsipouras' promise he would introduce them to LL Cool J, authorities said. Sexual advances were made to the girls, and the 16-year-old left, <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. The younger girl could not escape and eventually was sexually assaulted by three men, the sergeant said. `` They were overwhelmed by the celebrity status and all the flash,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` I think they were naive enough to go into the hotel thinking they would meet LL Cool J.'' The girl was crying and screaming during the incident, and other people were coming and going from the hotel room, Detective <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurila </PERSON> said. The three men were arrested early Thursday morning. The radio station, <ORGANIZATION> KDWB </ORGANIZATION>, is reviewing its practice of awarding backstage passes, said general manager <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, who said he was outraged by the incident. LL Cool J, short for Ladies Love Cool <PERSON> James </PERSON>, is among the best known rappers, and has a current hit, `` Walking With a Panther.'' His songs are known for explicit lyrics involving sexual conquests and macho stereotypes.

 Battles between tribesmen and native Assamese in northeastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have left at least 95 people dead, witnesses and news reports said Saturday. One official said 60,000 residents had fled. The warring sides fought with spears, bows and arrows, and homemade guns, said a witness to the clashes at <LOCATION> Gohpur </LOCATION>. `` It was like an ancient war,'' said <PERSON> Dibya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalita </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> Guwahati </LOCATION> to escape the violence. Gohpur is 112 miles northeast of this capital city of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> state. The Bodo tribesmen, who are of Mongol origin, are campaigning for a separate homeland in <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>, a remote state bordering <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Saturday that 95 bodies have been found in the area. It said the clashes had raged over the past four days. Officials reported five deaths, but their count was believed to be much too low. The <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION> director-general of police, S.V. <PERSON> Subramanium </PERSON>, confirmed reports of the battles but said he was awaiting details. The Assamese backlash at <LOCATION> Gohpur </LOCATION> started after 10 Assamese were burnt to death in a neighboring area. Bodo militants were blamed for the deaths. Hundreds of Bodo homes in 20 villages were set on fire, forcing residents to flee to neighboring <LOCATION> Arunachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state. A state government spokesman in the state capital, <LOCATION> Itanagar </LOCATION>, said 60,000 Bodos had crossed the state border since Wednesday. `` We are trying to provide them with shelter, but we fear more will come over,'' one official said by telephone from <LOCATION> Guwahati </LOCATION>. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. The Bodos, mostly farmers, were animists before they converted earlier this century to Christianity and <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s dominant religion. The Bodos make up about 30 percent of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>'s 20 million people. The proposed Bodoland would cover about one-third of <LOCATION> Assam </LOCATION>'s territory The government has refused to consider the Bodo demand for a separate homeland but says it is willing to talk to militants about ending the violence. Some Bodos began demanding a homeland more than two decades ago, but there were very few reports of violence until recent years. In a related development, Bodo militants killed eight Assamese policemen and wounded six in <LOCATION> Nalbari </LOCATION> district about 40 miles from <LOCATION> Guwahati </LOCATION>, police said Saturday. The policemen were killed when the militants used a remote-control bomb to blow up their jeep. No arrests were reported.

 A suspect has taken a polygraph test in the case of the possible politically motivated abduction of a councilwoman's dog, authorities said. Authorities would not release results of the test or the suspect's name on Saturday. Police Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeden </PERSON> said Friday the use of the polygraph did not signal a pending arrest. Town Council President <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>'s golden retriever <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a 7-year-old female, failed to come home after a romp on July 31. <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON> said a man phoned her about 12 hours later and said, `` Get off the council and you'll get your dog.'' <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>, a three-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> council member, has kept her position. Police have said that stealing a dog is punishable by up to a year in jail, and extortion by a maximum of 15 years in jail. Investigators said they think the call may be genuine because relatively few people knew of the dog's disappearance at the time the call was made.

 A jury found the city was not negligent in the death of a 20-month-old boy who was one of 12 people who died in a 1987 house fire. A <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated for five hours Friday night before ruling against <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreck </PERSON>, who sued the city in connection with the death of her toddler son, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Schreck </PERSON> claimed the city was negligent because a building inspector, who was at the one-family house three weeks before the fire, did not tell another resident, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, that smoke detectors were the responsibility of the tenants. The jury ruled Ms. <PERSON> Schreck </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, both survivors of the blaze, each was 50 percent negligent. `` It's over with,'' Ms. <PERSON> Schreck </PERSON> cried when approached by reporters after the verdict was announced. `` My son's gone and I'm the one that _ just leave me alone. Testimony at the trial conflicted on whether there were working smoke alarms at the time of the fire.

 Hundreds of friends and relatives attended a memorial service Saturday for four children who drowned when the family station wagon plunged into a river, but the youngsters' mother was in seclusion and their father in jail charged with their murders About 500 people crowded into a suburban <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> church to say farewell to <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, 8, and his sisters: <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 4; <PERSON> Kadie </PERSON>, 2; and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, 10 months. `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> was probably my best friend on the team. He used to tell a lot of jokes,'' 10-year-old <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>, who played on a baseball team with <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> this summer, said after the service. The skinny, short-haired youth said he nearly broke down during the one-hour memorial Mass at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alfred </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` My mom started crying and I was afraid I would start bawling, but I held it in,'' he said. <LOCATION> Wyandotte </LOCATION> police say <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, confessed to pressing down the car's accelerator and driving into the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Aug. 3 `` to be rid of his present burdens.'' He was described as pressed by money problems. Police say he intended to kill his children and wife, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON>, 32, by driving the car through a barrier on a road that ended at the river in the suburb south of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Both parents escaped from the sinking station wagon in which <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>'s father committed suicide 18 months earlier. Passing boaters tossed them life preservers; divers pulled the children from the submerged car about an hour later. The Rev. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ptak </PERSON> asked mourners not to prejudge the tragedy. `` We gather here this morning in such large numbers in an act of faith in our God, not to point fingers of blame or to prejudge what has happened, but to give thanks to God for the gift of the children's lives,'' said <PERSON> Ptak </PERSON>, assistant pastor at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alfred </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> was n't up to attending the memorial service for her children, <PERSON> Ptak </PERSON> said. `` It was a family decision that it was better if she did n't attend.'' The remains of the four children were cremated Monday. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Klauza </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Allen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> said after the service that she does n't know the DeLisles, but attended the service to show the family she cared. `` If he did n't want the children, he should have given them away,'' she said. But <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherly </PERSON>, 38, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON>'s mother, said, `` I do n't believe he could have done it because of the way he was around those children.'' <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, a sales manager at a Lincoln Park tire store, was ordered held without bond Friday on four counts of first-degree murder and one of attempted murder. The suspect first said a leg cramp caused him to jam the accelerator pedal, powering the car through a barricade and into the river. But Thursday, he admitted the crash was deliberate, said Wyandotte Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeski </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> said she tried to stop the car by turning off the ignition and shifting gears before the car struck the barrier. Relatives and acquaintances said <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> had trouble saving money and had amassed $ 13,000 in debts during the last 10 years. They said he worried about how he would provide for his family on his $ 33,000-a-year salary. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> remained silent during the 10-minute hearing and a plea of innocent was entered on his behalf. Twenty-seventh District Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmert </PERSON> ordered him held without bond until another court appearance Thursday. First-degree murder carries an automatic sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole. Attempted murder has a maximum sentence of life in prison.

<HEAD>Botha Appears Isolated in Power Struggle With Heir Apparent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Governing party leader F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> indicated Saturday his Cabinet colleagues supported him as a showdown approached in a leadership struggle with outgoing President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. Political commentators said the seemingly isolated <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> might quit under pressure or try to assert himself at a Cabinet meeting Monday by firing <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who replaced the president in February as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is expected to succeed <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as president after parliamentary elections on Sept. 6. One opposition leader, <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON> of the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was leading a `` palace revolution'' against <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and suggested the president could fire any rebellious ministers. Relations between <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> have been strained for months, but the rift intensified Friday when the president announced tersely he had not been consulted about <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s planned diplomatic mission to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on Aug. 28 <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> met for nearly three hours Saturday with almost the entire Cabinet at his home in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, then announced that the ministers had reached a unanimous decision how to handle the dispute when <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> convenes a full Cabinet meeting on Monday in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> refused to elaborate on the decision, but said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> does not in the least underestimate the seriousness of the situation.'' The dispute has deeply embarrassed the party at a crucial stage in election campaign and has virtually eliminated any chance for <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, to exit gracefully after 11 years in power. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> have been invited to meet with Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, a longtime critic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial segregation policies, The meeting has been hailed as a potentially historic breakthrough for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> announced Saturday that the trip would proceed despite the leadership dispute. The meeting of Cabinet members at <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s home was viewed as a direct challenge by the education minister against the president. Under the Constitution, only the president can convene a formal Cabinet meeting, although the ministers all are <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who owe political loyalty to <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Claassen </PERSON>, political writer for the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, reported that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officeholders were united in `` ill-concealed anger'' at President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. Leaders of the liberal and far-right white opposition parties, hoping for major gains in the elections, said the dispute reflected chaos atop the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has held power since 1948. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> made the initial announcement of the Aug. 28 meeting. <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, the foreign minister, subsequently confirmed the plans and said the arrangements were made in consultation with President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. The president, in a two-sentence statement Friday, in effect called his foreign minister a liar. `` I am not aware, in terms of the rules governing overseas journeys by -LRB- Cabinet -RRB- ministers, of the discussions to be held on 28 August as announced by Dr. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>,'' the president said. Newspapers reported Saturday that <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was braced for the possibility that the president might fire him. The Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> said the entire Cabinet might resign if any minister, including <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, were fired. The Citizen, another <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> daily, said the president could resign `` at any moment.'' The leadership rift surfaced when <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> resigned as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader after suffering a stroke in January. Party officials backed <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> in a power struggle focusing on how soon <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would retire. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s planned meeting with <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> is seen as important because the Zambian is chairman of the six-nation Frontline States, established for the purpose of confronting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> reportedly may offer to arrange a summit of all states in the region, including <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, if <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> commits his government to negotiating with the African National <PERSON> Congres </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending white-minority rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and gaining full political rights for the black majority.

 A pair of earthquakes of moderate intensity struck the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastal area Saturday but caused no damage or injuries, authorities said. A quake registering 4.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale rattled the coast in the state of <LOCATION> Chiapas </LOCATION>, near the Guatemalan border, at 7:12 a.m., <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s seismic center said. A second quake, registering 5.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, hit at 9:31 a.m. about 175 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and 100 miles from the resort of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. `` We felt it, but it was very weak,'' said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Banos </PERSON>, a receptionist at the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. She said the office had received no calls for help. Some residents of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> reported feeling the earthquake slightly. In Golden, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> also reported the second quake. Geophysicist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsch </PERSON> said it was about 60 miles deep, `` which might account for it being felt over longer distances.'' He said the deep quakes `` do n't cause as much damage as shallow earthquakes.'' Earthquakes are common along <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s seismically active west coast. A pair of massive earthquakes struck <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in September 1985, killing an estimated 10,000 people and destroying hundreds of buildings. The first registered 8.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and another the following day registered 7.5. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. An earthquake of 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause considerable damage and one of 6 can cause severe damage.

 The Pentagon on Saturday dispatched five more aircraft and 100 more people to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to help search for Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, and his office chief backed off earlier criticism of the rescue effort by saying she is now `` tremendously gratified'' by it. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON> declared `` we're not anywhere close'' to scaling down the hunt for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and 15 others, whose chartered Twin Otter vanished Monday on a flight from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> to a refugee camp near the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> border about 270 miles west-southwest of the capital. `` We're going to apply all the resources we can use,'' said <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON>, former air operations chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Sixth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> and now with the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going to continue to operate on the premise that there are survivors.'' <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team is again concentrating its search, including photo-reconnaissance flights by U-2 spy planes, along <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s planned flight path, after concluding that two earlier leads, involving faint signals detected both north and south of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> by weather satellites, were merely false readings. As of Saturday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military had one C-141 medical evacuation aircraft, two HC-130 search and rescue aircraft, and four MH-60 search and rescue helicopters, equipped with special night-vision gear, stationed in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, along with 165 men and women, <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON> said. He reported that two more HC-130s, one EC-130 command and control aircraft and two C-141 transports were on the way, along with 100 more people, and would arrive Sunday. The latest contingent includes Maj. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Record </PERSON>, director of operations of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> MacDill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, who will coordinate the American team. Coupled with the efforts of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON> said, `` I'm not aware of any search and rescue effort in the world that's involved this many airplanes.'' But he noted that the effort continues to be dogged by poor weather, limiting the usefulness of the 6,000 feet of film returned from each of the U-2 overflights, and hampering the visibility of the lower-flying rescue fleet. Two U-2 flights have yielded no results, and a third U-2 mission was flown Saturday. Each flight lasts 10 hours, with just two of those over the search area, and developing and analyzing the huge amount of film requires many additional hours. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s press secretary and office chief, <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, retreated from her angry criticism Friday of the rescue effort. Following reassurances later Friday from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and others, she said, the staff is convinced that a `` commitment and sense of urgency are now operating at all levels. We are tremendously gratified by that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> had said Friday that `` we have seen motion, we have seen some action, but we have also seen a lot of missteps,'' adding that `` we could have and should have located them by now.'' Saturday, in voice weakened by laryngitis, she said: `` I was somewhat astounded and not a little distressed that some had interpreted my remarks yesterday as being anti-military _ anti-our men and women in the military. Nothing could be further from the truth. We all believe that ... when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces come to the rescue, they have no peer.'' <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON> said that while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have permission to operate in the skies over <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, the main search effort will continue to be focused inside <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> for the time being. `` Certainly it is possible the airplane proceeded into <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, and we will be exploring that in due course,'' he said. Until now, he said, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes have used `` techniques that would give a 50 percent probability of detection,'' in the primary search area. `` We're changing now to a much slower and deliberate mode, which should give us n 80-90 percent capability of detection,'' he explained. The four helicopters, flown in from <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, are equipped with infrared devices and crews trained in night vision, but regular night flights likely wo n't begin until Monday, weather allowing, when relief crews are available, he said. As it is, the choppers are flying throughout the daylight hours, with mid-air refueling from the HC-130s, he said. Earlier in the week, hopes were raised that either of the two signals monitored via satellite had come from the plane's emergency beacon. But <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON> explained that the only ground station able to monitor the satellite data as it passed over <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, so far away that `` it's on the very fringes of the ability'' to decipher the signal correctly. Sophisticated electronic gear on lower-flying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes found no signals at the two locations, and, moreover, no evidence was found in either area by thousand of Ethiopian troops which combed them on oot, he said. <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON> noted, however, that the plane's emergency beacon would begin to deteriorate after 72 hours, and any `` usable signal'' likely would disappear in a week as the transmitter's batteries wore down.

 A coal mine explosion killed five Soviet workers and injured two on <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, the Norwegian news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday.

 Thousands of people rallied in the southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> Saturday to demand the removal of Soviet troops from an mainly Armenian area of the republic, activists said. Demonstrators in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> called for a strike and another protest Monday if authorities fail to meet their demands, said <PERSON> Mamedgassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambarov </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Gambarov, speaking by telephone from <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, said other demands entailed the recall of unpopular Azerbaijani deputies to the Soviet parliament and the cancellation of curfews throughout the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republic. Moslem activist <PERSON> Almaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Yestekov </PERSON> said the front was asking for the removal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a mainly Christian Armenian enclave in traditionally Shiite Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Disputes over the area, which neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> wants to annex, have led to violence several times in the last 18 months, causing authorities to impose curfews and bring in troops to keep order. Scores of people have been killed and thousands fled their homes. Slogans at Saturday's protest included `` <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> are indivisible'' according to <PERSON> Yestekov </PERSON>, who said he heads a fledgling news agency specializing in Moslem areas of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Activists said thousands of people attended the rally, but they gave no specific figure. Speakers also called for authorities to give the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> full legal status as an organization, <PERSON> Yestekov </PERSON> said. People's Front groups have sprung up in many of the 15 Soviet republics in an effort to push local demands for autonomy. They have become especially strong in the Baltic republics.

 Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> told Chinese leaders Saturday that if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> maintains its crackdown on dissent the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might approve even harsher sanctions on the communist nation. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said he met with <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qizhen </PERSON> to `` make sure Chinese leaders understood clearly the impact of the events of June ... on the American people.'' It was the first meeting by a ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmaker since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> banned diplomatic contacts with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership in June because of the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said, `` The ban applies only to the executive branch, not to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. ... My visit does n't change the status of our -LRB- U.S.-Chinese -RRB- relations at all.'' `` I thought it was extremely important that they understand that there is a deep feeling in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about what happened here in June,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> told reporters. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed the ban to protest the killing of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people when the army crushed the student-led democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> June 3-4 and continued the crackdown in other cities. The Chinese `` ought to understand very clearly that if certain things do n't change, or if there were a repeat of some of those events, we can expect <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to react very vigorously,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said. He came to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> at the invitation of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of Foreign Affairs. <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said he briefed Vice Foreign Minister <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON>, who is the ambassador-designate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, on what to expect in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and told <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> that many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> advocate harsher sanctions against <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> that legislative sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` constitute gross interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and we can not but react strongly.'' In addition to the prohibition of high-level contacts, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and some other Western nations also are maintaining indefinite bans on military exchanges, arms sales and new soft loans. <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said `` as much as they -LRB- the Chinese -RRB- would like to criticize us for meddling in their internal affairs, it was n't meddling at all. <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> expressed support of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opposition to stricter legislative actions and said he told the Chinese officials `` most members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do agree with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that this relationship is very important.'' But he added: `` To the extent -LRB- <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s -RRB- internal affairs tend to offend some basic values Americans hold, that would limit the freedom of action of the president. `` It could result in a response from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would further injure the relationship.'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said he did not come to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to act as a negotiator. `` In my view, only the President and his representative the ambassador can negotiate or offer the assurances of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> said. `` I thought it was important that they -LRB- Chinese leaders -RRB- understood that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a major role to play in this.''

 British nobility joined American cowboys and other <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states descendants Saturday to dedicate <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, once the frontier's fur trading headquarters, and to mark two neighboring states' centennials. The fort _ which played host to visitors ranging from Prince <PERSON> Maximilian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to naturalist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Audubon </PERSON> in the 1800s _ has been rebuilt to highlight the centennials of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. An estimated 15,000 people were expected to attend the two-day dedication of the four-year, multimillion-dollar restoration project by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and everyone else associated with it should be proud of their effort,'' said Lord <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Astor </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>, a direct descendant of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Astor </PERSON>, the founder of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that built <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1829. Located near the North Dakota-Montana border at the confluence of the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> rivers, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was a headquarters for fur traders and Indians of the mid-1800s. The area now is dominated by hulking oil rigs, farms and ranches. A few buffalo also can be found, remnants of the herds that once roamed the prairie. `` This is a piece of American history,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, a vacationing Barrie, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, resident who toured the fort Saturday with his wife, <PERSON> Irma </PERSON>. `` It's hard not to think of the poor buggers who built this originally, the hardships they endured.'' <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> dominated the economy of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> until the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> dismantled it more than a century ago when the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> went out of business. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> used some of the doors, windows and wood from the civilian fort to build its <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buford </LOCATION> just east of the trading post. Nothing was left of the original trading post and reconstruction depended on diaries, paintings and photographs for design and detail, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedren </PERSON>, superintendent of the 430-acre park. `` We've been faithful to the fort's original design as much as possible,'' Hedren said. `` The fort you see today, we feel, is what fur traders on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> saw in the mid-1800s.'' The centerpiece of the fort is the colorful <ORGANIZATION> Bourgeois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Finished in 1987, it now contains museum exhibits and administrative offices. The whitewashed walls of the fort began going up this past spring and were completed just in time for the dedication. Two bastions housing cannons sit at two corners of the facility. Modern-day `` buckskinners'' dressed in clothing of the period relived the past Saturday by peddling buffalo hides, beaver pelts and beadwork at a tepee encampment near the fort. Joining in the festivities was a contingent of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> officers from <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saskatchewan </LOCATION> who appeared in the distinctive garb of their 1870s predecessors. `` I'm a history nut, a buckskin nut, an Indian nut,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, who took part in `` living history'' activities at the fort Saturday. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> look-alike who is working this summer at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rushmore </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, attended the dedication in a replica of the uniform <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> wore in the Spanish-American War. Nearly $ 4 million has gone into the reconstruction of the fort. About $ 3.3 million came from the federal government and about $ 500,000 was provided by local supporters called Friends of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 A former mental patient apparently threw her three young children to their death off a 100-foot bridge then jumped in herself, police said. Seachers found the third body in the <LOCATION> Tombigbee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Saturday, and police said homicide charges were likely against their mother, <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, 22. Mrs. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was listed in serious condition at a hospital where she was treated for exposure and bruises. Police Chief <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said authorities discovered Mrs. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> along the banks of the river Friday, some 19 hours after she last was seen atop the <LOCATION> McCorquodale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> with her three children. `` She was sitting down in the water,'' Lt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> said. `` We have some witnesses who saw her on the bridge, and she apparently made some statements to the rescue squad regarding her actions,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the body of <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, 5, was found downstream from the bridge Saturday morning. The bodies of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 3, and his sister <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, also 3, were found Friday. Mrs. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> was found in shallow water near the bridge where her car, its motor still running and front doors open, was found Thursday night. Mrs. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, alerted police after he came out of a store about 11 p.m. Thursday and found the car with his wife and three children gone. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> flagged down a passing police car and told the officer his wife had apparently driven off with their children, <PERSON> Burge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, 31, told police his wife had mental problems and had been a patient in a mental hospital, said <PERSON> Burge </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will give <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> new weapons and aircraft if it confirms that more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms have reached guerrillas fighting to overthrow the government, a Soviet envoy said Saturday. <PERSON> Filip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sydorski </PERSON>, the third-ranking <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, said he could not confirm an Afghan general's statement that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is supplying <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with new MiG-29 fighters and the latest Sukhoi ground-attack jets to defend the country against a Pakistani attack. However, he said the MiG-29s could be part of new shipments. The Afghan government claims the Moslem guerrillas are backed by soldiers from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which provides headquarters to the guerrillas. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denies its troops are involved. In his remarks on Austrian television, <PERSON> Sydorski </PERSON> said, `` I'm sure if tomorrow some new <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons would appear on the soil of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, maybe the day after tomorrow, or a week after that, new kinds of weapons including new aircraft, maybe MiG-29 ..., would also appear in this country.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been quoted as saying the guerrillas will be receiving new weapons to counter highly effective bombing attacks by the Afghan air force. On Thursday, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said a contract for Soviet MiG-29s and Su-27 ground-attack jets had been completed. Soviet ambassador <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said in June that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be accepting an Afghan request for MiG-29s and Su-27s if there was an escalation of fighting and border violations by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are sponsors of the April 1988 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. which provided for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15 and an end to outside interference in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

 Even in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION>, a tiny dot of a town near the banks of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, they found <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> and took her children away. Even after eight months of hiding and thousands of miles on the `` underground railway'' when she was starting to hope for a new life, the legal system that she profoundly distrusts caught up with her. `` All I wanted to do is keep my children safe,'' a sobbing Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> said Saturday. `` The courts wo n't do it.'' `` I do n't know what I'll do now,'' she said. She fled <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in November with her 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter after a jury acquitted her ex-husband, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, of sexually molesting the daughter. A secret network that helps women in such situations spirited her first to the South, then to a battered women's shelter in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for three months and finally, in April, to <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION>. `` They said they could get me to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> or to <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION>, and I just could n't face <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, 40, recalled in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` They said they could guarantee me they would n't find me in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but ...'' On Friday afternoon, <LOCATION> Chouteau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a deputy and social worker <PERSON> Diann </PERSON> <PERSON> Button </PERSON> appeared at her front door with a court order. `` That social worker said the children were confused,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> said, weeping and burying her face in her hands. `` They were n't confused, they were terrified.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he learned earlier last week that Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> might be living in the area when a local resident recognized her picture from an article in a magazine. As for the children's reaction to the arrival of the officials Friday, he said, they became upset only when their mother did. `` The children were n't bad until she started screaming and hollering and saying, ` You're not taking my children! You're not taking my children!''' the sheriff said. The children have been placed in a foster home and a hearing is scheduled Thursday. Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> was not taken into custody; <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the civil warrant pending in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> could not be enforced in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> was jailed for a week in February 1987 during the couple's bitter divorce in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> for refusing to tell a judge the whereabouts of her children. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, 34, was indicted in March 1988 on charges of sexually abusing the daughter, but he was acquitted in November. A <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> then stripped her of the children's custody, awarding <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> joint custody with the state. Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> disappeared the same day with the children. <PERSON> Kellett </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, said Friday night that his client was `` very relieved and happy at the prospects of getting the children back'' and planned to attend the hearing Thursday. Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> would not be specific about her flight from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, saying she wanted to protect the people who helped her. She said she never knew full names of any contacts in the underground network, nor whether the names she was given were real. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said his initial investigation shows she traveled in at least six states, including <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> said that during her three months in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> shelter, a therapist worked with her daughter and may come to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to testify at Thursday's hearing. Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> was vague about why she was sent to <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION>, a town of about 80 people in the wheatfields and rangeland of north-central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Using the name <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibeau </PERSON>, she said, she rented a small two-room house on a dirt street and has worked since April at the <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafe </ORGANIZATION> and Motel. She said she quit her job Friday night and has contacted an attorney through <ORGANIZATION> Nashua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rape </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Assault </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which has aided her since 1986.

 State legislatures are under pressure to act on a variety of issues, including abortion, lawmakers were told during a national convention. The 5,000 delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION> got the grim word from panelists and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials in dozens of sessions at the six-day meeting, which ended Friday. Increased spending is the prescription for most of the ills, but the states' economic future is clouded by large trade and federal budget deficits, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president pro tempore and president of the <ORGANIZATION> NCSL </ORGANIZATION>. Unfunded federal mandates have added billions of dollars in new responsibilities for the states in recent years, <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said. Federal welfare reform and changes in catastrophic health care and nursing home legislation will also raise state costs, he said. A survey by <ORGANIZATION> NCSL </ORGANIZATION> staff showed that education makes up more than 50 percent of state budgets nationwide. The overall increase in spending was 7.2 percent, up from 6.6 percent a year ago. Spending on corrections rose 14.1 percent while the increase in Medicaid costs was 10.4 percent. `` The greatest concentration of fiscal problems this year was in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, places that just two years ago were faring better than most states,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NCSL </ORGANIZATION> president-elect and minority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. While some delegates claimed a continuing erosion of state sovereignty by the federal government, one of the highest-profile topics at the convention was an issue many legislators would rather leave to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ abortion. About 600 demonstrators, half of them chanting pro-choice slogans and the other half singing hymns and carrying anti-abortion placards, marched downtown Monday as delegates arrived for a social event. In a July 3 decision in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, the high court implicitly invited states to enact their own laws on abortion 16 years after the court made abortion legal. `` It's not our business,'' <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, state representative from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, told a crowded session on Wednesday. `` We're going to be making a serious mistake if we step into this swamp.'' But <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> told lawmakers they wo n't be able to steer clear of the issue. `` We're stuck with the fact that this is an issue that has to be dealt with,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` It is n't going to evaporate. It is n't going to disappear `` I do n't think this is an issue about polls ... or holding your finger in the wind to see which way the wind is blowing,'' he said. `` I think this is an issue that you have to look within yourself.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON> also had advice for lawmakers. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> called for more state spending to lower infant mortality and <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> urged states to raise local gasoline taxes and spend more on highways. <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON>, now head of a large waste disposal company, said lawmakers should show more backbone in finding sites for solid waste landfills. Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said his department will design a `` road map'' for a national energy policy, but said many of the policies must be implemented at the state level.

 Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> union members on Saturday launched a 26-day series of rallies and other actions to gain support for their strike, which has been weakened by picket-line crossings and courtroom setbacks. The rally near Eastern headquarters was attended by a crowd estimated at 300 to 500 people. `` These people over across the street have done a good job in their psychological warfare. Now they're out there telling the world it's over. Well, it's not over,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, District 100 president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. `` So hang in there. There'll be good news coming.'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, national president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, joined <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and other Machinists, pilots and flight attendants on the first blocks of a `` moving picket line'' march. `` Journey for Justice,'' read T-shirts worn by many of the picketers. The rally opened a 26-day series of parades, motorcades, rallies, petition drives and lobbying planned in 13 states. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, which represents pilots at nearly every major carrier, has been discussing a nationwide job action to show support for Eastern workers. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said the unions want to ensure that the public understands that the strike, which began March 4, is still on. The unions also want to spur congressional action, pressure President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene and revitalize solidarity throughout the national labor movement, he said. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said labor leaders will urge <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, to push a House-passed bill calling on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint a presidential emergency board that could send the unions back to work while trying to reach a settlement. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> called that action the best hope for ending the strike. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused in the early days of the strike to intervene. `` This is an important strike, not only for <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees, but for the national labor movement,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said, adding that what he called the anti-union management tactics of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> must be stopped He also predicted Eastern wo n't survive unless its veteran employees return to work. `` The publicity turned against us, but not to the point it's going to stop the strike,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> added in an interview Discussion a week ago by the pilots' union leadership about ending the strike spurred the most picket-line crossovers since the walkout's first week. An estimated 250 union pilots returned to work last week, prompting Eastern to stop hiring new pilots, and about 140 flight attendants crossed the lines. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has enough pilots for its plan to rebuild despite the strike, but <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, because of a shortage of mechanics and spare parts, does n't have enough flight-ready planes. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> local chairman, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement was meant to hurt union morale `` They want to scare the hell out of people, trying to break us,'' <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who said only 2 percent of his union's 8,500 members have returned to work, said the pilot crossovers `` has been damaging to the morale of the people'' because the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> emphasized the importance of pilot support. The Machinists struck after 1 -LCB- years of federal mediation failed and were joined by the pilots and flight attendants. Company spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> declined to comment on the union rally and denied that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had claimed victory. `` There are no winners in a strike,'' he said. Friday's announcement was `` just to state the facts'' that no more pilots are needed, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days into the strike, plans to rebuild to an airline two-thirds of its pre-strike size. The company's plan for its creditors said it will fly 800 daily flights with 1,700 pilots by the end of the year. Eastern has 350 daily flights, compared with nearly 1,100 before the strike. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said more than 600 union pilots, of 3,600, have returned to work, joining 300 newly hired pilots who completed training and 700 to 800 in training.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader, on Saturday quietly celebrated the sixth anniversary of his command of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Defense Forces No public ceremonies marking the anniversary were announced by the Noriega-controlled government or Defense Forces. The anniversary followed several confrontations between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> troopers in recent days. On Friday, a Panamanian patrol briefly detained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military police in four vehicles in the <LOCATION> Curundu </LOCATION> area near the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Earlier last week, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops blockaded <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>, which contains both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian military facilities. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has rebuffed all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts, including economic sanctions, to force him to step down. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has exerted pressure to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him on drug trafficking and money laundering charges in February 1988. He denies the charges. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration `` would not rule out'' seizing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and taking him to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to face drug trafficking charges. But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not contemplating such a move at this time. Opposition leader <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> told a news conference Saturday the presidents of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> believe that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the major obstacle to democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> met last week with the presidents and other officials in those <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations. <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> were the two vice presidential candidates on the opposition slate in the May 7 elections. <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said the three presidents `` have a very clear idea that popular sovereignty and national sovereignty can not be dissociated and they consider that only a free people can really be sovereign.'' International observers said the opposition won the May election by a landslide, but the government annulled the balloting a few days later saying there had been vote fraud. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was the opposition's presidential candidate. The opposition has proposed a plebicite this month to allow Panamanians to decide whether they want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to continue in his command. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Friday the proposal was tantamount to turning <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> into `` a colony that accepts arrogance, vassalage and indignity.'' He made the comment in a speech at a parade of thousands of troopers and paramilitary civilian units ending a 10-day exercise called `` Zap the Intruder.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have the right to conduct their own exercises under the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties to assure the security of the canal. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to abrogate the treaties, which provide for the canal to be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Burmese Opposition Leader Gives Up Hunger Strike, Britain Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that Burmese opposition leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> had given up a hunger strike and that her British husband and their children would return to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in September. Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s main opposition political party, is under house arrest by the military government. Her husband, <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Aris </PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> to see her July 22 and had not been allowed contact with British diplomats since. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> lodged a formal protest Aug. 4. On Saturday, <PERSON> Aris </PERSON> met with the British consul in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> at a <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> military guest house in the presence of three <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. The Burmese government had said that under terms of Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>'s house arrest, members of her family are forbidden to make contact with foreign embassies. Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> had been reported on hunger strike but no details had emerged. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Aris </PERSON> told the consul his wife had abandoned a protest hunger strike but would remain under house arrest. She gave up the 2-week-old hunger strike after `` a solemn assurance'' from <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> officials about the safety of her followers in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, the daughter of slain independence leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, has urged the military government to hold free elections and end their 27-year rule in the former British colony. She was one of the most popular speakers in nationwide protests for democracy last year. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking anonymously, said <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> was being unacceptable when it insists that <PERSON> Aris </PERSON> consider himself under the same restrictions as his wife if he chooses to stay in the country. The couple's sons, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, 16, and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 13, subject to similar restrictions, would be returning to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to continue their education. <PERSON> Aris </PERSON> said he was applying for his visa to be extended beyond next Saturday when it expires, the spokesman said. `` Depending on his wife's continued well-being he intends to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> in early September.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the conditions of the meeting were `` not entirely satisfactory,'' although the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> representatives did not intervene. And the spokesman condemned the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> government's continued `` muzzling'' of Ms. <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, the daughter of slain independence leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>.

 Thirteen people were killed Sunday in a hot-air balloon accident in central <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, police said. They said the balloon fell out of the sky at 7:08 a.m. over desert land about 10 miles south of the airport in the town of <LOCATION> Alice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, about 800 miles south of the port of <LOCATION> Darwin </LOCATION>. It was at least the second fatal hot-air balloon accident in nine days. Another occurred in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. on Aug. 5. Police were interviewing witnesses, who were on another balloon nearby, but had not yet determined the cause of the accident. Police said all on board the balloon died.

<TEXT>
 A horse trying to get to a fig tree in its owner's yard fell into a swimming pool and treaded water for a half-hour in the deep end before he was rescued. Fadge, a 9-year-old, 1,100-pound Arabian, was rescued Friday from the 30-by 18-foot pool, where he had to stay afloat in 8 feet of water until rescue crews could save him. The horse was discovered by 3-year-old <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Aceves </PERSON>, whose father, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, owns both the horse and the house. `` At first I thought it was a paper horse, because horses are n't supposed to be in swimming pools,'' said <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Aceves </PERSON> had to drain the pool so that <PERSON> Fadge </PERSON> could stand until rescuers arrived. Firefighters and animal control officers used a tarpulin and ropes to pull the animal out, but only after they coaxed him to the shallow end. The horse was exhausted and disoriented, but otherwise unhurt, said <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>. `` It's a good thing we got here when we did because he was going to drown,'' <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> said. `` He had given up and probably thought he was going to die in there.'' <PERSON> Aceves </PERSON> said the animal was trying to reach the fig tree in the yard.

 Thousands of firefighters shoveled and sprayed to corral nearly 93,000 acres of burning <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> timber Saturday, and the weather cooperated with occasional rain showers and lower temperatures. `` We're getting the proverbial scattered showers,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Buist </PERSON>. `` It has n't rained on all the fires, but the places where it does, it helps.'' Officials remained concerned that more lightning and higher temperatures could start fires again. `` It's still looking highly suspicious out there, like there are some thunderstorms coming in,'' said <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, fire information officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> to the north. A 45,000-acre complex of fires that incinerated part of the town of <LOCATION> Lowman </LOCATION> northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> two weeks ago was 75 percent contained Saturday, but was burning heavily within fire lines, <PERSON> Buist </PERSON> said. It could be completely contained by Monday night, he said. To the north, another complex of blazes reached 20,380 acres and made short runs inside its perimeter, although <PERSON> Buist </PERSON> said it could be totally contained by Sunday. About 1,200 Army personnel were called in last week to help `` backfire'' forest, creating a blackened buffer between the blaze and cabins in the <LOCATION> Warm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> area. The number of firefighters working statewide dropped from 10,000 on Friday to 8,000 Saturday, said <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Standa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the federal hedquarters for fighting wildfires. <PERSON> Buist </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> would keep its 5,100 firefighters for now to gain a handle on the blazes. A 9,700-acre complex that raced toward the old mining town of <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> for a time was stalled, as firefighters sprayed the flames to keep smoky debris from being blown into unscorched ground, <PERSON> Buist </PERSON> said. `` We're focusing on the hot spots and wetting down 450 feet inside the fire line because it's still so touchy,'' he said. Several fires in an 11,000-acre complex were contained by Saturday and almost controlled, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. The fires had burned along the <LOCATION> Main </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which is used heavily by rafting parties during the summer. Fire crews were demobilizing from a 6,800-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in the north-central part of the state. So far this year, 42,000 fires have destroyed 1.4 million acres in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, about half of the 2.8 million acres blackened by 63,000 blazes in 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Standa </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Christian gunners and their Syrian enemies pounded <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and surrounding areas Saturday in one of their most vicious duels in five months of fighting. At least 22 people were reported killed and 110 wounded. The wanton exchange of firepower across about a fourth of the country prompted the Moslem prime minister to appeal directly to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders on Saturday `` to stop this insane, merciless torture of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its population.'' `` We're left in the blowing wind with no roof above us,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said earlier on the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> radio. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> heads the Moslem Cabinet vying for power with a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet under Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. According to his office, <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> made urgent telephone pleas to Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> as well as to King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. Fahd, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, and Bendjedid lead an Arab League effort to end the bloodshed. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it asked <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to end `` with all urgency'' its bombardments in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It said it is sending envoys to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to discuss the situation. The Moslem-run Voice of the People reported that an orphanage in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was hit Saturday night, and three children were hospitalized in critical condition. The French and Argentine embassies were hit by Syrian rockets, and one <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> guard was slightly wounded, security sources said. They also said the residences of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and French Ambassador <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> in suburban <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, came under shellfire for a second night in a row, but no casualties or serious damage were reported. Nearly the only movement left on the deserted streets of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was dust pushed by the summer wind, mingled with clouds of ashes from buildings and nearby forests that burned out of control. All but about 200,000 of the city's 1.5 million people have fled. `` Luckily, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> has been deserted. Otherwise, the barrage would have killed hundreds,'' said one police source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Aside from a brief lull early Saturday, the shelling was continuous from Friday morning, bringing the toll since March 8 to 608 killed and 1,624 wounded by police count. Shells and rockets rained down on some areas at the rate of 60 per minute, security sources said. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' government is backed by the Syrians and their 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrian soldiers came under terms of a 1976 peacekeeping mandate, but <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has said they back Moslem forces and has vowed to drive them out of the country. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> leads about 20,000 mainly Christian troops. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> issued a statement Saturday calling on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to impose a political and economic boycott on <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` The intransigence of the Syrian regime should be confronted and the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army should be made to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> altogther so this country can regain its unity and end terrorism on its land,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said in his appeal, broadcast on Christian radio stations. The Moslem-run Barbir Hospital near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green line took several direct salvos that started a fire in the three top floors of the eight-story hospital during Saturday's exchanges. `` We've managed to rescue all patients and remove them to the bunker, but we can not receive any more casualties,'' said a doctor who answered telephone calls. He spoke on condition of anonymity. One salvo crashed into an empty room on the fourth floor of the Cavalier Hotel in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Several foreign reporters and photographers were staying at the hotel, but no casualties were reported there. The latest round of fighting in the 14-year-old civil war broke out after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports operated by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to salvage lost customs dues. The Syrians and allied Moslem forces retaliated by besieging and shelling the Christian enclave. Witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners, using U.S.-designed 155-mm howitzers, scored direct hits on a dozen Syrian artillery emplacements and multi-barreled rocket launchers The witnesses said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunfire targeted <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> emplacements in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the southern slum of <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Barajneh </PERSON>, the southeastern <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> hills </LOCATION>, the mountain range east of the capital and the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley. Syrian forces shelled most of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave that includes east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and communities to the north, security sources said. The fighting covered roughly a fourth of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4,015 square miles.

 An anti-drug activist slain when a gunman opened fire through her window was described Saturday as a martyr by friends who vowed after her funeral to continue fighting to rid their neighborhood of drugs. `` I know my wife, wherever she's at, is looking down on us and will give us the strength we need so we can continue the fight,'' <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said as he and hundreds of supporters arrived at Cypress Hills Cemetery behind the hearse bearing <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s pink coffin `` Drug dealers got ta go!'' the crowd chanted along the two-mile walk from the family's home in the borough of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Some carried signs with slogans like: `` Death to drug dealers!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a 34-year-old mother of three, was killed Tuesday by a gunman who fired five bullets into her bedroom from the street as she dressed for work. Authorities believe it was in retaliation for the anti-drug efforts of the victim and her husband, who has received numerous death threats. Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>' wake was interrupted Friday when a bomb threat was telephoned to the funeral home. Mourners were evacuated but no bomb was found. `` We march through the streets of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> because we believe that <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s spirit has and does and will make a difference in our community,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Plock </PERSON> told mourners at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Baptist church Saturday. `` It will strengthen our resolve and stir our community.'' Among those attending the funeral Mass was Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who went to the pulpit and said the answer to the drug problem wo n't be the military, the police or more drug education efforts. `` Those most important to the elimination of the drug scourge are people like <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. The city should tell <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and others with the courage to take a stand, `` You are not alone,'' he added. After the funeral, friends and supporters gathered in front of the <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s home. Police estimated as many as 300 people marched on foot, while behind them were dozens of cars. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a family friend, said she and her children were marching so that <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> would know `` that people are with him. This has to be stopped, one way or another.'' `` She really died a martyr,'' said a 28-year-old administrative assistant and marcher who declined to give her name, saying she is active in the fight against drugs in her own neighborhood.

<HEAD>Report: Chinese Student Leader Predicts New Revolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Chinese student leader who fled after pro-democracy demonstrators were killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said he escaped by hiding under timber in the back of a truck, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper reported Sunday. The Sunday Express reported that Wu'er <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, 21, and his girlfriend, student activist <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, 19, were now living on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in a hideout it claimed was guarded by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. It said We ` er was interviewed Friday at the hideout. The newspaper quoted Wu ` er as saying that his escape was aided by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> students and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. It did not disclose any further details of his escape. The Express said Wu ` er predicted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s communist leadership would be toppled within three years `` if an incident does not provoke it sooner.'' If 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader, dies soon, `` it could be a signal for the people to come out on the streets again,'' Wu ` er was quoted as saying. The demonstrations in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square were sparked by the death of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. Wu'er was quoted as saying that his network of contacts in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> estimate that 3,000 people were killed when the army stormed the square on June 3-4, and that 120,000 have since been arrested or executed. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official news agency, has said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. Wu ` er captured worldwide attention in a televised confrontation between hunger-striking student leaders and Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> in the Forbidden City shortly before the army assault. `` I was just a student, out of hospital, but I had no fear of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>,'' he was quoted as saying. `` He is a devil but he did not frighten me. I told him to start democratic reforms and not delay.'' Wu ` er said he was in the square when tanks rolled in. `` Students tried to reason with soldiers who were firing like madmen, bayoneting young men and women,'' he was quoted as saying. `` I was put into an ambulance with two dead students ... As we sped to hospital, I saw the tanks firing their machine guns into the crowd.''

<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Saturday defended the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION>, built 28 years ago to block East Germans from fleeing to the West, and said hopes for the removal of the barrier are `` illusory.'' <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON>, the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the wall is `` a step toward peace'' and repeated the government stand that it will remain in place as long as the reason for its construction exists. Sunday is the anniversary of the construction of the wall on Aug. 13, 1961. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a statement Saturday calling the wall `` the relic of a bygone era and a failed policy.'' `` We observe this sad anniversary with renewed determination to overcome the division of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the statement from Camp David, Md. He said he hoped for a Soviet response that would make <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, divided into East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, `` a place of cooperation, not a point of confrontation.'' In its commentary, Neues Deutschland accused the West of trying to `` economically plunder and destabilize <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' After World War II and the division of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, hundreds of thousands of people fled from Soviet-controlled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> until the concrete and barbed-wire wall was built. The East German economy struggled and stumbled as workers, scientists, artists and intellectuals escaped to the West. Once in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the East Germans qualify for immediate citizenship and social assistance. Another flow of East German refugees has been moving recently through communist <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which has dismantled much of its border barriers with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. East Germans can gain permission to travel to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> with relative ease and an estimated 1,500 have gone to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> this summer and then escaped through <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. As many as 400 other East Germans are seeking refuge at West German embassies in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and seeking exit visas. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has allowed them to stay in the embassies but on Tuesday it closed the doors of its <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission saying it was crowded and could not accommodate any more people. Last week, officials of both East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were encouraging the East Germans to return home and seek legal means of emigrating.

 Hungarian-born photographer <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON>, who profiled such stars of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s golden era as <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>, died of heart failure, his publisher said Saturday. He was 83. <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON> died at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, said publisher <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>. A professional photographer since he was 16, <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON> devoted his career to taking pictures of illustrious personalities, and was recognized as one of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s top photographers. `` The only thing that was expected of me was to make images that the press would choose to print over everyone else's,'' <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON> said in an interview last year. `` You must realize that there were 5,000 pictures available on any major star. To get printed, yours had to be the best.'' <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, on April 16, 1906. While a teen he ran his first studio in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. At 19 he went to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he managed the portrait studio of the <ORGANIZATION> Keystone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also known as the <ORGANIZATION> Talbot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>. He opened his own studio in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, when he was 23. Among his European subjects were <PERSON> Sigmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Freud </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevalier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. But with war brewing, <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in 1937 and joined <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> studios. `` I do n't think that at any time in history more people so talented on every level had ever come together as in the Hollywood of those decades,'' <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON> said of the 1930s and 1940s. <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON> said his favorite photo subjects were <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vivien </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gable </PERSON>. `` They knew what was expected of them,'' <PERSON> Willinger </PERSON> said. `` These stars not only cooperated, they were eager.

<HEAD>Shrimpers Ticketed Under New Trawling Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> ticketed six shrimpers for violating new trawling-time restrictions intended to keep sea turtles from drowning, authorities said Saturday. Five shrimpers in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION> were issued citations for trawling without turtle excluder devices during 30-minute restricted periods, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwin </PERSON>. The new regulations being rigorously enforced since Friday night require shrimpers to limit trawling to 105-minute intervals as outlined by a Coast Guard time chart or use the devices, which are designed to allow sea turtles to escape from shrimping nets. The devices are big boxes attached to nets with hinged sides that turtles can swim through. Shrimpers who elect not to use the devices have to pull their nets from the water during the 30-minute intervals when trawling is prohibited. `` I would think that a vessel that has its nets in the water during those periods will be a good candidate for boarding,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandifer </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been broadcasting the time schedules and is warning shrimpers before each 30-minute ban goes into effect, <PERSON> Merwin </PERSON> said. Shrimpers out during the 30-minute intervals are being asked to pull in their nets for inspection. Those without the devices are fined. The maximum fine for a first and second offense is $ 8,000. The maximum fine for a third offense is $ 12,000. Fines are levied by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Merwin </PERSON> said. The Coast Guard is patrolling areas from <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>. The order to enforce the limited trawling option was issued at 6 p.m. Thursday. Three hours later, the captain of a shrimping vessel off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast was cited after a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boarding crew observed that it was trawling illegally, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Shrimpers who have fought against using the excluder devices are concerned that the regulations implemented by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> are so complicated they will be hard to follow.

 Four armed fugitives agreed Saturday to release three hostages in return for a plane to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, but they refused to hand over the captives when the plane turned back because of darkness, police said. Police on a highway in south-central <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> continued to surround the armored car where the fugitives held the three hostage late Saturday. `` We're back to square one,'' said <PERSON> Jairo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pires </PERSON>, a spokesman with the <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. The kidnappers, two married couples, had agreed to trade their captives for the aircraft and a pilot Saturday, police said. But after the plane took off from <LOCATION> Presidente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prudente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, 635 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, the pilot turned back, saying it was too dark to land on the highway, according to police. The kidnappers began their crime spree on Aug. 3 when they abducted a boy from his home in <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>, 852 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. Their motive was not clear, armed robbery and kidnappings for ransom have increased in recent months. Six days after the kidnapping, police found the kidnappers' hideout on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> Police exchanged the boy for $ 42,000, the armored car, a driver and three local television reporters. After releasing one of the reporters, the kidnappers headed for the <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where authorities refused to exchange the hostages for an airplane. Police then chased the armored car 500 miles through three states. During one stop at a roadside cafe, one kidnapper stepped out of the armored car and held a pistol to a hostage's head. The chase ended early Friday when the kidnappers stopped on a highway near <LOCATION> Presidente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prudente </LOCATION> and demanded a helicopter in exchange for their three hostages. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> helicopter was summoned from <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> to a nearby airport, but the helicopter pilots refused to fly the couples unless they surrendered their grenades, machine gun and two shotguns. Police then contracted a twin-engine plane. About 100 heavily armed police continued to surround the armored car and sharpshooters aimed their rifles at the vehicle's small windows. The three local television reporters who volunteered to take the boy's place at the beginning of the drama were identified as <PERSON> Solange </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Calassa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Monteiro </PERSON>. The kidnappers later released <PERSON> Monteiro </PERSON>. The standoff was the third in four months in which criminals took hostages. In early July, six armed men hijacked a packed passenger bus in the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> after an unsuccessful bank robbery attempt. After being chased 200 miles across the back woods of northeastern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> with three hostages, police killed three of the fugitives. In April, three bank robbers in a remote northeastern town robbed a bank, took five hostages and fled by plane 1,200 miles to the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> has accepted undisclosed libel damages from a British tabloid newspaper that reported Sunday it had published false reports about the actor's private life. <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> accepted an apology for libelous articles published in the News of the World on July 9 and `` a large sum'' in libel damages and legal fees, said a statement agreed to by the actor and <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Shiite Moslems in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> commemorated the holy day of Ashura Saturday with many striking their heads with the flat edge of their swords or chains until they drew blood. Ashura, marking the death in battle of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> saint <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in A.D. 680, is the holiest day of the year for the world's 100 million Shiite Moslems. Scores of white-robed Shiites, bleeding from head wounds and chanting religious verses, led a procession through <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a Moslem country with fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> leaders, will commemorate Ashura Sunday. Ashura is derived from the Arabic word for the number 10. It refers to the first 10 days of the first month of the Islamic lunar calendar, <LOCATION> Muharram </LOCATION>, culminating in the tenth day, the day of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s death. The division of Islam into <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> and Sunni groups developed after the death in 632 of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, the founder of the faith. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s closest followers determined that his companion, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakr </PERSON>, be declared the next leader of Islam. A minority of Moslems challenged the dicision and argued that the leadership should be dynastic and should therefore have gone to <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, the son-in-law and cousin of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, who had no sons. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> did become leader but after his death in 661, a dynasty known as the Ummayids and based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> declared it was the ruler of Islam. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, the son of <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, challenged the Ummayid rule and the Ummayids representing the mainstream Sunnis sought to crush <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s movement. In 680, the Ummayid forces surrounded <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and his followers and killed them in a battle at <LOCATION> Kerbala </LOCATION>, about 100 miles south of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> in modern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. But the victory did not crush the Shiites and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s death added an element of passion to <LOCATION> Shiism </LOCATION>, which venerates martyrdom. Shiites follow the same major rules and rites as the Sunni Moslem majority of about 800 million, including five prayers a day, the pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, and fasting in the holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>.

 A blind man who said he held up a bank after losing his Social Security money will not be prosecuted for bank robbery but for a lesser charge of burglary and grand theft, authorities said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>, 34, was arrested for investigation of holding up a downtown <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> branch of $ 950 on Thursday. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> told police he became desperate after public agencies were unable to help him when he lost his government check, said officers who questioned the man. He told police he planned to use the money to buy food and pay for overnight shelter. `` It was a choice between robbing the bank or killing myself,'' said <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON>. `` I was at the end of my rope and I was frightened.'' <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> will be charged with second-degree burglary and grand theft when he is arraigned Monday, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, chief of the district attorney's criminal division, said Friday. Authorities decided to charge <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> with the lesser crimes because of the circumstances and the man's blindness, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. Both charges could be reduced to misdemeanors, the prosecutor said. Bank robbery is a felony that carries a sentence of two to five years. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> was being held in the city jail. According to police accounts of the robbery, <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> handed a teller a note demanding money. Another employee slipped out of the bank and called a police officer. It was not until <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> was arrested at gunpoint that officers and the teller realized he was blind, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> was not armed.

 The high court in the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> on Saturday sentenced a Sri Lanka-based Maldivian businessman to death for leading a failed coup in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> archipelago, the <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> government said. Seventy-five people, including 68 Sri Lankan Tamil mercenaries, were convicted of participating in the Nov. 3, 1988 coup attempt. Sixteen people, four Maldivians and 12 Sri Lankans, were given death sentences. The other 59 received prison terms ranging from nine to 38 years. The condemned men will be hanged, said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleem </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Maldives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody here feels those guilty of this grave crime must be severely dealt with, there should be no leniency,'' <PERSON> Saleem </PERSON> said by telephone. The court found businessman <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> guilty of organizing the attempt to overthrow President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON>. The attempt was crushed by Indian paratroopers after <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> requested help. At least 17 people, mostly local residents, were killed in the fighting. The Maldivian government has said the convicted Sri Lankans were mercenaries who were members of a Tamil separatist group. Chief Justice <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathy </PERSON>, heading a three-judge panel, read the sentences at a hearing after nearly two months of trial. No dates were set for the execution. The court has asked the convicted men to pay $ 14 million as compensation for deaths, injuries and property damage, the government statement said. There is no higher court of appeal in <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, a string of coral islands in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Only President <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> can commute the sentences. The last death sentence in <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> was carried out in 1951 by a firing squad. The <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> archipelago is about 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and roughly the same distance south of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The country is made up of about 2,000 islands, but only about 200 are inhabited.

 Residents on both coasts coped with summer downpours Saturday as New Yorkers slogged through ankle-deep water and Southern Californians were told to be `` water tight'' while an aqueduct is repaired. Thunderstorms last week that tore up the aqueduct that supplies three-quarters of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' water also damaged hundreds of homes in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. On Saturday, Eastern storms flooded roads, small streams, subway tunnels and the roof of a <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, apartment building where collapsing ceilings chased out eight families. `` I've lost everything _ my furniture, my clothes, my car,'' said <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>, a 63-year-old unemployed farmworker who said he saved for 10 years to buy his modest home in <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, across the state line from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Another mudslide was reported at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, one mile west of where 15 mudslides occurred two days ago. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, reported street flooding from 3 inches of rain that fell during an hour and a half. One parking lot was under 2 feet of water and many cars were stranded. A stationary front along the middle and northern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast brought the torrential rain in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, with 2.9 inches from midnight to 3 p.m. Up to 10 inches of rain fell Friday at the eastern end of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. More than an inch of rain fell in one hour in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> early Saturday morning and again in an afternoon hour, but the amounts were well short of the one-hour record of over 2 inches set in 1983, said meteorologist <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. That word would have provided little solace, however, to thousands of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pedestrians who found themselves wrapped in sheets of falling water or to subway riders whose packed trains were stalled by power shutoffs caused by the flooding. Suburban travelers had problems too. In <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> just north of the city, 6.66 inches fell between midnight and 3 p.m., closing roads. Up to 5 inches of rain fell in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, area before tapering off around 4:30 p.m. Friday, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendell </PERSON>, a hydrologist at the <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. Firefighters found 5,000 gallons of water collecting on the roof of a <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> apartment builing where several ceilings collapsed Friday. `` When we found the water was coming down through the ceiling into the light fixtures we called the building department and began to shut off the power and the building department suggested we evacuate the building,'' said firefighter <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>. Forecasters said rain could continue through the weekend on the affected parts of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Since Wednesday, widely scattered downpours have inundated areas from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. A 1,000-foot stretch of the huge <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aqueduct </LOCATION>, 180 miles north of the city, buckled, cracked and popped Thursday after it was flooded by heavy rains and clogged with debris. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> engineer, said crews working around the clock would need about two weeks to repair the aqueduct. Repairs could take longer if it continues to rain, he said. `` What we're asking is that everyone take to heart our conservation program and be water tight,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, director of resources for the Metropolitan Water District of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The repairs were expected to cost at least $ 500,000, and highway damage in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> was reported at more than $ 1 million. Affected residents spent Friday and Saturday pumping water and shoveling mud from homes. `` We're not going to recover from these storms for a long, long time,'' <LOCATION> Yuma </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> said. `` We were totally underwater.'' Some of the most serious damage was done to agriculture, <LOCATION> Mono </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, sheriff's spokeswoman <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> said. `` There's some folks over there with a huge field of garlic just ready to pick and it's all gone,'' said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> farmer <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Orris </PERSON>.

 About 500 people marked the approaching 20th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> music festival by camping in the rain Saturday at the late <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Yasgur </PERSON>'s farm. A mix of original festival-goers, teen-agers, yuppies and remnants of the hippie days set up camp in the field nearly 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to mark the coming anniversary of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. Rain turned parts of the farm into mud reminiscent of the Aug. 15-17, 1969, festival, which about 400,000 people attended. The land's current owners, <PERSON> Charley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelish </PERSON>, allowed scores of people to camp out on a field without charge, but asked vendors selling food, T-shirts and souvenirs for donations to repair the field and spruce up the property. Traffic was moving along smoothly, <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. Roads near the site had been converted to one-way trafic to improve trafic flow.

<TEXT>
 A coroner may have acted callously in removing a dead man's corneas for transplant despite his family's objections, but he did not violate anyone's rights, a federal judge ruled <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> on Friday dismissed a $ 1.5 million lawsuit against the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office brought by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Brotherton </PERSON>'s survivors. The judge expressed concern at the coroner's `` arbitrary and insensitive actions,'' but said he had no option but to dismiss the lawsuit, which also named an eye bank and an organ procurement center. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said the family was mistaken in making property claims in the case, but told them they could sue in a state court in which the defendants can be accused of causing severe emotional distress. Defendants in the lawsuit included the coroner, Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procurement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brotherton </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, refused <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s request for an organ donation following her husband's death, saying her husband was opposed to the practice <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> later allowed a technician from the eye bank to remove <PERSON> Brotherton </PERSON>'s corneas, even though his wife's objections to organ donations were included in hospital records of <PERSON> Brotherton </PERSON>'s death. Clear corneas from dead people are used in transplant operations to replace corneas that are clouded by cataracts. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said the hospital made no effort to relay <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brotherton </PERSON>'s objections to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He also said the coroner routinely allows removal of corneas without looking at medical records or documents belonging to the dead people from whom the corneas are taken. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> was not available for comment.

 While well-connected Republicans received political favors from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, Democrats also benefited, according to a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Democrats did not realize financial benefits as big as some <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members, but former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s favoritism was not limited to his own party, the Times reported in Sunday editions. `` Believe me, it was n't just Republicans at this party,'' an unidentified senior housing official told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. In one example the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> cited, a political supporter and friend of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was awarded a $ 5 million grant and federal subsidies for 500 apartments. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> was head of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors federal agencies. The Times said that in the last three years <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> awarded millions of dollars in grants from a discretionary fund to projects in the home districts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., who was then majority leader; <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., former majority whip, and <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> None of the awards was illegal, the newspaper said. Republican consultants, developers and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> secured favors from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> by appealing to the political loyalties of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> managers, the Times said. Democratic representatives also approached <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials for grants and subsidies, but more often they took advantage of their majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by imposing their wishes on housing appropriations bills, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of Hungarian reform communists published a statement Saturday condemning the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 that crushed a liberal communist government. A statement in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> from the reform group in the city of <LOCATION> Debrecen </LOCATION> called on the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the government `` to condemn ... the forcible intervention'' by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies, including <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, 21 years ago The statement said the group also agreed with a declaration being circulated in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> urging the release of political prisoners. `` We are closely following the attempts of the democratic forces in today's <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. The Czechoslovak leadership has said people signing the declaration face fines and imprisonment. But Czechoslovak sources in the West say at least 15,000 people have signed the proclamation. The <ORGANIZATION> Debrecen </ORGANIZATION> statement came nine days before the 21st anniversary of the invasion. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Szokai </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s deputy chief of international relations with other communist parties, on Friday said the invasion was `` essentially wrong.'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. With the exception of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, all other members _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ participated in the invasion. Six independent Czechoslovak groups plan peaceful marches and silent protests on the Aug. 21 anniversary of the invasion to voice their desire for `` freedom, democracy and human rights,'' an emigre source in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Palach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, a newsletter published in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> by Czechoslovak emigres, reported the six groups were circulating a statement that said: `` The approaching Aug. 21 is a source of concern for many responsible and level-headed people among us `` The past year has shown clearly that Czechoslovak citizens no longer wish just to wait, especially since major changes for the better are taking place around us. `` It is ... to be expected that this year many people will wish to express their disagreement.'' The changes it referred to are reforms under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and some Soviet-bloc countries including <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The six groups circulating the statement were not identified.

Everything we've hoped to look at we're going to get to see.'' Early Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 2 photographed the two partial rings, called `` ring arcs.'' They are arc-shaped belts different from the complete rings that encircle <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION>, Uranus and Jupiter. Since early July, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> has discovered four small moons orbiting <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in addition to the previously known moons, Nereid and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>.

 There's not much complaining going on about the `` summer doldrums'' on Wall Street this year. Or if there is, it's hard to hear it above the din of record or near-record highs in stock prices and increasingly optimistic appraisals of the state of the nation's economy. Things are even looking a little brighter for the securities industry, one of the few sectors of the economy that felt severe ill effects from the crash of 1987. In the last few weeks just about all the major stock-market indicators have reached new peaks, surpassing the highs they set two years ago before stock prices collapsed. The laggard Dow Jones average of 30 industrials nearly made it to new high ground as well in the past week, before afternoon selling on Friday turned it back. Stock investors could hardly fault the news background, which showed a 0.4 percent decline in the producer price index and a 0.9 percent increase in retail sales for July. Those government figures suggested more strength in the consumer economy, and at the same time less upward pressure on inflation, than analysts had generally expected. Indeed, most of the evidence lately has tended to dispel fears of an impending economic slump of major proportions. `` That possibility looks extremely remote,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The economy is decelerating gradually, not rapidly.'' `` ` Soft landing' is still the best bet,'' observed <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, economist at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts say Wall Street's fortunes have benefited in particular from signs since late spring that individual investors, slow to heal from the wounds of the'87 crash, have at least been returning in significant numbers `` Retail activity is at its best level since the crash,'' observed <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON>, who follows the brokerage industry for the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's early, and a severe market downturn could nip it in the bud, but it looks as though the individual is coming back to the stock and bond markets.'' At the close of business on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at 2,683.99, up 30.54 from the week before but still shy of the closing high of 2,722.42 it set on Aug. 25, 1987. Other readings for the week showed the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index up .63 at 192.27; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market up 5.06 at 462.48, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index up 4.54 at 380.64. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 200.81 million shares a day, up from 182.43 million the week before and the heaviest total this year. The pace of activity belied August's one-time image as the slowest period of the year on the Street _ a pattern that has been fading for years as investing institutions have come to play a bigger and bigger part in the markets. Individuals still carry a lot of weight, however _ if not through direct purchases and sales of stock, then through moving their money in and out of mutual funds that in turn invest it in the stock market. `` The public has finally shifted to the buy side on stock mutual funds for the first time since the crash,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweig </PERSON> in a recent edition of his advisory The Zweig Forecast. `` If the public comes back here, it could be a big plus.''

 In the beginning, there were digital computers. They were big, slow and very stupid. A half-century later, digital computers are very small and fast, but they're still hopeless idiots compared to humans. The main problem was, and still is, that computers just ca n't think But what if computer circuits could be made to resemble our brains? What if they could learn from their mistakes? Hundreds of tiny companies have sprung up in the past three years hoping to answer, and cash in on, those questions with an approach called neural networks after the neurons that are the basic structure of the human nervous system. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapang </PERSON>, a 36-year-old Filipino physicist who left <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to start <ORGANIZATION> Syntonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, shipped what he believes is the first commercially available neural network chip to Electrodyne, a Japanese company, in May. The chip is called DENDROS-1, a reference to dendrites, the highly branched filaments of nerve or brain cells that let the cells communicate. It simulates neurons by combining a variety of signals to come up with a single result. Tapang compares it to measuring the flow of water through a vast network of different-sized pipes by emptying them into a single pool. Such a system of computing values is called `` analog,'' which implies a continuous form of measurement, like the sweep second hand on a watch. Digital computers, like digital watches, chop time and numbers into tiny bits and add them up one at a time. In fact, `` bits'' are the smallest unit of information in the binary system that is the `` brain'' of a digital computer. The great advantage of today's digital computers is that they can add those bits incredibly fast, even if it is done only one bit at a time. There is some evidence from research on animals and people that the neural cells in our brains use a kind of digital system to transmit signals. These on-off pulses, called spikes, confused early researchers and led some to believe that the brain relied on a digital model to process information. Instead, they found it was only a tiny portion of a complex electrochemical system that channels signals the way <PERSON> Tapang </PERSON> is trying to imitate. `` A neuron by itself is dumb, but the totality of that network of neurons in our skull is probably the most intelligent machine in the universe,'' he said. The key word is `` network.'' It is the interaction of neurons in our brains that gives rise to thought, not the action of a single neuron. In that sense, <PERSON> Tapang </PERSON> said, digital computers are doomed to be electronic dunces because their chips were designed to be solitary devices called central processing units, channeling all operations through one electronic `` pipe.'' Even if CPUs are connected, the result is only a faster dunce. However, some computer scientists and industry analysts are skeptical. Neural networks will `` be a fine addition to what we've got now but they'll just supplement it,'' said <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, editor and publisher of Release 1.0, a New York-based computer newsletter. `` They'll never replace the mathematically precise logic of a digital system. `` I fundamentally disagree with this ` bated breath' attitude in the industry about the next breakthrough being neural chips or networks. They're good at things like pattern recognition but still can not cope with our kind of ` fuzzy thinking.' A lawyer might ask, ` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON>, why did you do that?' and accept a fuzzy answer, but a computer ca n't.'' One <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, Calif.-based company, <ORGANIZATION> Synaptics </ORGANIZATION>, has used neural network technology to develop what it calls a <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Retina </LOCATION>. An array of photo sensors emulates the light receptors in the eye, and an analog computer processes the image for display on a video monitor. Tapang uses capacitors to simulate neurons, which rely on chemicals to transmit signals between synapses. Capacitors store and release electricity in much the same way. DENDROS-1 has one fixed connection and 22 variable ones that simulate synapses. It can be layered with other chips to create an overlapping network of communicating capacitors that `` fire'' signals to each other. As in the brain, the firing of one electronic neuron affects the others. An important feature is each neuron's ability to damp its neighbors, creating a pattern. The variable interaction is a crucial part of the network. The applications for <PERSON> Tapang </PERSON>'s chip include things like pattern recognition. <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON> agrees the best uses for neural chips and networks would be tasks like analyzing seismic patterns to predict earthquakes and hunt for oil or gas, analyzing brain waves, identifying fingerprints or other classification chores. But she remains skeptical about their potential. So does <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltz </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Thinking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, which makes a supercomputer built of up to 64,000 digital processors harnessed together. The problem with neural networks is that you ca n't keep expanding them, <PERSON> Waltz </PERSON> said. `` The whole field of neuropsychology says that increasing the scale means greater complexity. If you scale up the size of a neural net you increase the complexity of solving the problems you give it.'' Mathematicians claim they can use mathematical functions to achieve the same effect as neural networks, and such formulas can be readily understood, he said. `` The main problem with neural networks is that we just do n't understand how they really work any more than we understand how the brain really works.'' <PERSON> Waltz </PERSON> believes the boom in neural network research will slow but that interest will continue, because it is `` easier to write programs for neural nets than for any other system. Almost anybody can play the game.'' `` The digital age is over and the analog era is here,'' <PERSON> Tapang </PERSON> said. `` The next step is making computer chips that can communicate with each other and this is a step in that direction.''

 They're ready to start the celebration here on Wall Street, but the guest of honor still has n't shown up. The missing party in question is the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, one of the few widely recognized measures of stock price trends that has n't reached a record high this summer. f it does n't put in an appearance before long, some would-be revelers worry, the hors d'oeuvres might wilt and the punch might go flat. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock composite index, the benchmark against which most professional investors gauge their results, surpassed its high from the summer of 1987 a couple of weeks ago. The separate indicators for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and American Stock Exchanges and the over-the-counter market all have lately topped their pre-crash peaks. So have measures of mutual-fund performance, which matter especially to the great majority of individual investors. So, too, has the Dow's sister average that tracks transportation stocks. But official certification that the stock market has fully recovered from the crash that occurred in August, September and October of'87 has been left to await a new high in the Dow. As close as it came last Thursday and Friday, the average's Aug. 25, 1987 close of 2,722.42 still stood as the record when the weekend arrived. The average fell 28.64 points Friday to finish the week at 2,683.99. By what right has this stubborn creature held up the festivities? Well, analysts say, it has the privileges of seniority if nothing else. `` The Dow Jones industrial average is the granddaddy of all the market indices,'' noted analysts at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a recent commentary on the situation. `` Developed at the end of the last century, it was designed to be easy to calculate in those days of inkwells and green eyeshades. Most of the newer market indices are broader in scope and track many more individual issues.'' To be fair about it, the average has been modernized over the past decade or so to include such stalwart companies of the 1980s as <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> among its 30 components. Still, analysts say, the average remains dominated by `` smokestack'' industrial companies whose stocks have lagged of late because of intensified international competition and, most recently, worries about a possible recession in this country. `` The <ORGANIZATION> DJIA </ORGANIZATION> being a laggard is somewhat unusual,'' observed <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicoski </PERSON> at the brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a recent commentary. `` But because of the economic-sensitive nature of many of its components, it should not be totally unexpected.'' Since the market peak two years ago, the biggest drag on the Dow average has been one of its most illustrious members, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, which remained last week more than $ 55 below its 1987 high of $ 174.87. Analysts say the Dow also has suffered from a special factor _ a dearth of takeover interest in most of its components, because of their size. Behemoths like <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> are more likely to be acquirers, as they have been, than acquirees. If the industrials had attracted bids the way issues in the transportation average _ <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and so forth _ have lately, the story would have been much different. In fact, members of the industrial elite have become takeover targets in the past _ for example, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, from <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> in 1985. On those occasions, objections have often been raised that the Dow was overstating the market's strength.

 Despite the brains and technology that manipulate today's investment strategies, the financial markets have once again demonstrated their pack-like behavior. At first it seemed as if encouraging signals about the economy would propel the stock market to a total recovery from the cataclysmic plunge of October 1987. Indeed, so much attention was riveted on the undulating <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average _ the last major stock index that had n't decisively pierced its pre-crash high _ that the index's half-hourly moves Friday were followed like rounds of a boxing match. But for reasons that perhaps could be best described as a sudden change of heart by the buyers, bond prices reversed themselves after a hearty runup and stocks blindly followed, sending the Dow average and other indexes lower. Sophisticated strategists who had put themselves on a limb by gambling that prices would rise had to scramble to sell, their earlier thinking rendered useless by the mass transformation of buyers into sellers. Some economists found what seemed to be a logical explanation for the sudden shift in psychology by reassessing the government reports on inflation and consumer spending released Friday. The report on a 0.4 percent drop in wholesale prices in July, for example, initially suggested investors should n't worry about inflation _ a good reason to buy stocks and bonds. But it was viewed later as a sign that interest rates could decline precipitously and inflation could surge anew _ a good reason to sell. The market gyrations coincidentally came the same week the big savings and loan bailout was launched, marking the biggest bailout ever by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Stock and bond investors largely ignored the signing of the legislation by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, even though critics said the $ 285 billion rescue of the nation's broke savings & amp; loans could ripple through the economy in the form of unaffordable mortgages, lower property values and lower interest rates for certificates of deposit.

 Traders on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> cheered when the Dow Jones industrials average finally _ if only temporarily _ cracked its all-time high. The reaction was only half serious. To the professionals who buy and sell stocks on Wall Street, records are fine but are n't the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. `` Traders are glad to see a record because it does hold out the promise of a better market, which brings more business,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seijas </PERSON>, a partner in the NYSE-member firm <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, said after the market closed Friday. `` But the record itself does n't hold a lot of magic for the traders.'' On Friday, the widely followed <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average of 30 industrial stocks briefly topped the record high of 2,722.42 set Aug. 25, 1987, before finishing down 28.64 points at 2,683.99. It was the second straight day the Dow flirted with the all-time best. On Thursday, when it broke through the level for the first time since before the October 1987 market crash, traders cheered _ some facetiously, according to floor brokers. `` I think most of us are sophisticated enough to know that records are only good for the media, for the newspapers and television. It does n't mean anything to the pros,'' said one commission house broker, who asked not to be named. Although some broader market indicators have been at record levels for days or weeks, the Dow Jones industrials' approach to the record is considered the final sign of Wall Street's recovery since the Oct. 19, 1987, crash, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> fell 508 points. Traders said that despite an extended rally that has seen a 25 percent runup this year, the stock market remains tempered by the memory of the crash. `` It's much more cautious now,'' <PERSON> Seijas </PERSON> said. `` Prior to the crash it was getting to be an easy game _ no one feels like that now.'' But unlike pre-crash 1987, inflation is n't rising, the dollar is up and interest rates have fallen. Stock prices marketwide are at about 13 times corporate earnings, compared with about 20 times in 1987, analysts said, indicating that stocks are not overvalued. `` Statistically speaking, all the numbers are pretty good,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Henderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another member firm. `` All these factors should meld into an environment that will be conducive to higher levels of equity prices.'' Economic news swayed the markets on Friday as the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wholesale prices slumped 0.4 percent in July, the biggest drop in three years and far greater than many economists had predicted. The government also reported that retail sales in July rose a healthy 0.9 percent following two straight monthly declines. The combination of slow-but-steady economic growth and low inflation _ what economists are calling a `` soft landing'' _ have helped strengthen the bond and dollar markets and lent optimism to the stock market, experts said. A slowing economy decreases the likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will push interest rates higher to help curb inflation. That is seen as good for corporate profits and for bond prices, which move inversely to interest rates. The reports sparked an early rally in the bond market, which sharply reversed later in the day on speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> might not be inclined to push interest rates lower. The yield on the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond finished at 8.15 percent, up from Thursday's 8.05 percent. In addition, the dollar surged against major currencies in foreign exchange, rising to 141.90 Japanese yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 139.80 on Thursday. For the brokers and traders streaming out of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> exchange after the closing bell Friday, the hope of a stronger economy means that individual investors _ who pay higher commissions than institutions _ may be tempted to buy stocks again. Despite the rally, individuals have avoided stocks because of the crash and better investments in other areas such as money markets. But as those rates have fallen recently, there has been some renewed interest in stocks.

 A number of would-be passengers are asking not to be booked on flights using DC-10 jetliners, following two explosive engine failures within a month on the jumbo jet, several agents and carriers say. Since the July 19 crash of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, which killed 111 people, about 400 customers have asked not to be booked on DC-10s, <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> at its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters, said Friday. <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said the number compared with the total 150,000 passengers <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> carries daily. The <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas-built </ORGANIZATION> aircraft is used by some 50 airlines around the world. There have been several other incidents involving DC-10s since the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crash, which followed an explosive engine failure. In one of the latest incidents, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 made a safe emergency landing Thursday in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> after a so-called `` uncontained engine failure'' in which flying parts punched holes in the housing of the airliner's tail-mounted engine. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> majors <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> fly a total of 166 DC-10s, and about 300 more are flown by foreign carriers. American, the nation's largest airline, flies 61 DC-10s, followed by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> with 55 and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> with 20. Northwest has worked with about 25 customers who have expressed concern about the aircraft, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> `` It's not indicative of any kind of hysteria,'' he said. `` I think most people basically want to be reassured.'' As a matter of policy, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> will not allow changes of aircraft on discount tickets where any changes normally are prohibited, <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said. At <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, nearly all fliers expressing aircraft preferences are accommodated, unless the only choice on a particular route is the DC-10, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. Even requests by passengers with discount-fare tickets _ which usually prohibit changes in flight plans _ are being granted, he said. Nearly all the worried customers are vacationers and other leisure passengers, as opposed to seasoned business travelers, airlines and agents say. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, an agent at JB's <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, reported that about a quarter of the agency's customers are requesting non-DC-10 flights. `` Slowly but surely, we're getting more requests from people to stay off DC-10s,'' he said. Other travel agents, like <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, say they're seeing more apprehension about air safety in general, not limited to specific types of aircraft.
