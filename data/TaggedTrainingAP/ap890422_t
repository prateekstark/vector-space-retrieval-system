<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Responding to demands in Parliament for curbs on press intrusions into private lives, mainly by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s racy tabloid newspapers, the government on Friday announced an independent review panel and told editors `` to clean up their act.'' Home Office Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON> said the panel would report within a year. `` Editors and publishers of the national press in this country are on probation,'' <PERSON> Renton </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have a year or two to clean up their act.'' British media freedom, meanwhile, came under unprecedented scrutiny at an international conference on Friday, spurred by charges that Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government has undermined the public's right to know. The announcement in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> came as the group of editors, publishers, broadcast executives and journalists debated news media freedom at a one-day seminar sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The watchdog body, which has a membership of 2,000 publishers and editors in some 60 countries, normally focuses attention on government harassment of newspapers or journalists in Third World countries. Political charges that the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government has undermined press freedom, and complaints about excesses by mass circulation newspapers are the two big issues in a growing controversy about the news media in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. On the political front, editors cite a government ban on broadcast interviews with the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, far-reaching official secrets laws and a three-year court battle over government attempts to block publication of `` Spycatcher,'' a retired intelligence agent's memoirs. But newspapers have themselves been increasingly criticized for sensational stories that boost circulations of the major tabloids, which each sell more than a million copies a day. `` What is disturbing is the fact that the government can get away with this without the public caring,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, editor of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s pro-conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. `` The British public is disenchanted with the press. The chief issue is how we raise our standards so that the British public will care about the press.'' <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> announced the press review panel after a `` right of reply'' bill foundered Friday in the Commons for lack of government backing. The bill, put forward by a rank-and-file legislator, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON>, sought to empower the government to force newspapers to publish corrections of errors. The bill attracted considerable support from government and opposition legislators, but <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> rejected it on grounds `` it would introduce a measure of government control over the press.'' Supporters accused the tabloids of what one called `` replacing journalism with voyeurism.'' `` The reporter's profession has been infiltrated by a seedy stream of rent boys, pimps, bimbos, spurned lovers, smear artists with grudges, prostitutes and perjurers,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitken </PERSON>, a rank-and-file <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator. `` This is a cast of shame.'' Apart from racy stories about the private lives of people from TV stars to accident victims, the tabloids regularly incur the wrath of Buckingham Palace for pursuit of the royal family. At the seminar, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> participant, <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Bullen </PERSON>, director of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, contrasted British and American treatment of the news media. `` Where there is an Official Secrets Act here, we have a Freedom of Information Act,'' said <PERSON> Bullen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, editor of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the top-selling upmarket weekly in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, led complaints by editors and broadcast chiefs about government use of court orders. During the controversy over `` Spycatcher,'' national newsapers were barred at each stage by orders, called `` prior restraints,'' from publishing. `` There is a culture in this country against the freedom of the press because ... the government and the judges belong to the same club,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON>, referring to the British establishment. `` We must have the freedom to publish and then take the consequences.'' In a series of disputes since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> won power in 1979, the government has also clashed with television networks, usually over features and documentaries involving the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> or the intelligence services. Also, media and civil rights groups charge that a bill to reform the catchall 1911 Official Secrets Act is inadequate. One example they cite is the government's refusal to allow civil servants who leak classfied information to argue they acted in the national interest to expose a government cover-up. Earlier Friday, a British delegate at a a meeting of 35 nations to monitor a recent East-West accord on media freedom said the attitude of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government toward the media `` alarms us.'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Acherson </PERSON>, a columnist in the Observer, a liberal <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> weekly, said the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government tradition of organized unattributable briefings by officials to domestic political correspondents conflicted with the East-West accord. The accord was signed last January by the 35 nations at the end of of the Conference on European Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>.

 A group of 120 refugees was put on a jetliner and returned to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the latest mass deportation of illegal aliens by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The flight of the INS-chartered <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 was the fifth such flight since Feb. 21, when the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> began a crackdown on undocumented aliens crossing the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. A previous charter flight of 231 aliens left <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on March 13 and was believed to be the largest mass deportation by the INS. More than 1,300 Central Americans have been deported since the crackdown began. The refugees _ some smiling, other sulking _ were processed out of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detention camp near <LOCATION> Bayview </LOCATION> and filed into four buses bound for the <LOCATION> Brownsville-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Padre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. There were no Nicaraguans on the flight, although more than a quarter of the 1,250 detainees at the camp are from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Nicaraguans are the only nationality to have escaped the crackdown, thanks to a directive issued by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in July 1987. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> requested that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> encourage asylum applications and work authorizations for refugees fleeing the leftist Nicaraguan government.

<HEAD>Bush Reportedly Favors Mix of MX, Midgetman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is reportedly planning to recommend a mix of single-warhead Midgetman and multiple warhead MX missiles in a budget decision that will determine the future of the nation's nuclear arsenal. A <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> source, who declined to be identified, said Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision was `` expected to be some kind of mix of rail garrison MX and Midgetman, but the final mix is to be determined.'' The decision represents a setback for <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who reportedly favored deploying only one mobile missile, the 10-warhead MX. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was supposed to make a final decision this weekend and inform <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to remove the nation's 50 MX missiles from their concrete silos and put them on railroad cars to be shuttled around the country _ an option known as the rail garrison MX. He reportedly wanted to cut off funding for the truck-mobile Midgetman. The decision on the missiles was one of several that must be made as <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> tries to cut $ 10 billion from the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. According to congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources, both Star Wars and the B-2 stealth bomber face the budget ax when <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> announces his choices at a congressional hearing on Tuesday. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> plans to scale back work on the B-2, which at recent estimates of $ 500 million per plane is the most expensive aircraft in history, while cutting funding for Star Wars. Details on the proposal for the B-2 were not immediately available, the sources, who requested anonymity, said Friday. Star Wars, of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION>, would be cut to $ 4.8 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> in fiscal 1990. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who made Star Wars his top priority, had asked for $ 5.9 billion in fiscal 1990 and $ 7 billion in 1991, a sharp increase from the $ 4.5 billion allocated for the program this year. The total defense budget stands at $ 299.2 billion _ $ 10 billion less than the budget former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted in January and in accordance with the cut agreed upon a week ago by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The defense secretary discussed the shrinking military budget at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> meeting with the chairmen and ranking members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> and the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s plan calls for the elimination of funding for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey troop transport aircraft, retirement of one of two aging aircraft carriers _ the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> or the Midway _ when the <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> is commissioned in 1990. Such a retirement would maintain the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> carrier force at 14 instead of the 15 sought by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The defense secretary is also planning to shift 24 frigates to reserve status and cancel $ 1.4 billion procurement of the F-14D Tomcat fighter jets. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also retained <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan to eliminate funding for the last two submarines in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> class, SSN688, in favor of the newer class SSN21. In addition, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> plans to mothball a handful of B-52s; delay the Millstar program, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s communications satellite program; and cancel the Army Helicopter Improvement Program. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had proposed spending $ 210 million in 1990 for Millstar and $ 299 million for the <ORGANIZATION> AHIP </ORGANIZATION>. Buys of the Blackhawk UH-60A would be reduced from 83 to 72 and purchases of the F-15E would be reduced to zero. That program had been earmarked for $ 1.7 billion in the fiscal 1990 budget. Army force structure would be reduced by 5 percent with cuts in the number of people employed at headquarters and in procurement. Those attending the meeting with <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> were <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the panel; Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the panel; Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtha </PERSON>, D-Pa.; and Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McDade </PERSON>, R-Pa., the chairman and ranking member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first half of fiscal 1989 ended with a budget deficit that is running 7.4 percent ahead of last year's, according to the government's latest report on its financial situation. For the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the budget deficit totaled $ 128.43 billion, up from the $ 119.61 billion shortfall posted in the first six months of last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is estimating this year's deficit will total $ 163.3 billion, up 5.3 percent from the $ 155.1 billion shortfall posted in for all of fiscal 1988. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, this year's deficit was not supposed to exceed $ 146 billion. The administration and congressional leaders last week unveiled a compromise plan designed to reduce the deficit in the next fiscal year to $ 99.4 billion, just within the $ 100 billion target for fiscal 1990 established under Gramm-Rudman. In March, the government posted a $ 35.78 billion deficit, up 22.2 percent from the same month last year and the highest monthly shortfall since May 1986. Revenues last month were up 3.9 percent from March 1988 to $ 68.28 billion, while spending of $ 104.06 billion was up 9.5 percent. Economist <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wrightson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said last month's deficit surge was largely due to technical factors related to the timing of government payments for tax refunds and veterans' and disability benefits. He said checks totaling $ 5 billion in tax refunds and $ 2.5 billion in benefits that normally would have gone out in April were mailed out at the end of March, artificially inflating the monthly deficit figure. `` If you take out technical factors, last month was right on top of last year's number,'' <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> said. `` This points toward an annual deficit in the $ 145 billion range, which would be better than last year and better than most people are currently expecting.'' Economist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> DeNoon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said that even setting aside the special factors that inflated March's shortfall, he expects the deficit this year to be in the range of $ 160 billion to $ 165 billion. `` Clearly, it's not doing as well as it was last year,'' he said. <PERSON> DeNoon </PERSON> said much of the worsening in the deficit so far this year has been linked to government payments to help shore up the troubled savings and loan industry. Analysts say the deficit also has increased because of higher-than-expected interest rates so far this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to slow down economic growth and thus restrain inflation. The largest government spending category last month was the military. Defense spending in March totaled $ 28.9 billion and reached $ 148 billion for the first half of the fiscal year, up 4 percent from the same period during the previous year. Spending on Social Security last month totaled $ 19.5 billion and reached $ 111.1 billion for the first six months of fiscal 1989, 5.8 percent ahead of a year earlier. Interest on the national debt totaled $ 16.5 billion last month and $ 117 billion so far this year, up 11.2 percent from a year earlier. Health and Human Services programs other than Social Security cost $ 16 billion in March and $ 82.8 billion so far in the fiscal year, up 6.9 percent from the previous year. Spending by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last month was $ 3.8 billion and totaled $ 28.6 billion for the first half of the year, up 9.7 percent from a year earlier.

 More than a third of the first-grade boys in rural <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> have tried smokeless tobacco, and the number increases to 70 percent by seventh-grade, a study shows. The recent <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION> study found that the most frequently stated reason for using smokeless tobacco was its taste, followed by peer pressure, a desire to feel `` grown up'' and the influence of role models such as athletes. The study used children in grades one, three, five and seven in urban and rural schools in western <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` It was apparent during the administration of our questionnaire that the first-graders clearly understood what oral tobacco was,'' said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McClary </PERSON>, co-author of the study. `` In two of the rural schools, several little boys immediately jumped up to show their containers of chewing tobacco, which they kept in their back pocket.'' State law allows a 6-year-old to buy and use smokeless tobacco but prohibits the sale of cigarettes or cigarette papers to anyone under 17.

 Relatives of Americans killed in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 say they are encouraged by recent government response to aviation security problems but still want a broad investigation into the incident. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> on Friday announced rejection of calls for an independent commission to look into the Dec. 21 bombing. He then took off for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to meet with transportation officials in five countries, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, spokesman for relatives of nearly 200 Americans killed in the explosion over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, expressed disappointment with the decision, saying, `` We feel there's enough information that's been uncovered that only an independent investigation can deal with appropriately.'' <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, was killed in the bombing. Among concerns of the relatives are the lack of a public warning of threats against the flight, security procedures that failed to detect the plastic explosive which authorities say was believed planted by terrorists, and inadequate government response after the incident. <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Demarest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said, however, there have been several positive developments since the relatives staged a rally and met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 3, including steps to improve aviation security. He said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to escort relatives who want to visit <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> was meeting in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, this weekend with the administration's nominee to head the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and next week with government and airline officials in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, in a news conference for foreign journalists covering <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he would push for security initiatives that would `` encourage international travelers to retain their justified confidence in the system's safety.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers have given `` unbelievable attention'' to security and are the safest in the world. His spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> and other transportation and security officials were flying most of the way on a government plane to meet a tight schedule but would likely make at least part of the trip aboard commercial airliners. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON> rejecting the call for a separate investigation, said, `` For a variety of reasons, we do not believe formation of an independent commission is necessary or prudent.'' The letter was accompanied by a five-page outline of administration action since the Pan Am explosion. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he had confidence in the investigation by Scottish and West German authorities and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and believed those responsible for planting the bomb, which investigators have said was hidden in a radio-cassette, will be apprehended and prosecuted. `` I can assure you that in my opinion the investigation is moving at full speed,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` I think that eventually and hopefully in the not too distant future, the public will know the full story there.'' He said it was important not to disclose targets of the investigation or the information being sought. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said his trip would review screening given foreign nationals hired by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines abroad and seek diplomatic approval for installation of devices to detect plastic explosives in airports used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers abroad.

<HEAD>Bush Extends Economic Sanctions Against Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will continue the economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that were imposed in May 1985 by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> that the trade embargo will continue `` as long as these measures are appropriate,'' but also suggested the sanctions could be lifted if free elections are held February in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The trade sanctions are an essential element of our policy that seeks a democratic outcome in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by diplomatic means,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in his letter. `` The policies and actions of the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. The ban covers imports of Nicaraguan goods into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and exports by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ except goods destined for the Contra rebels who have fought for eight years to overthrow the country's Sandinista government. The presidential order also prohibits air and ship traffic between the two countries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s order came as a group of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, both Democrats and Republicans, sent a telegram to Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Friday, criticizing the law <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> adopted this week to govern its elections scheduled for next February. The telegram, sent by a group led by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said the law is `` biased, unfair and designed to monopolize power rather than seek national reconciliation.'' An aide to one of the sponsors provided a copy. It calls on <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> to meet jointly with political opposition leaders and come up with a new election law to comply with the peace plans adopted by the presidents of the four Central American democracies and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, in 1987 and in <LOCATION> Tesoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, this year. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration also has expressed strong displeasure with the new election law, contending it gives the Sandinista government and its candidates an unfair advantage. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will dominate the electoral council that will run the elections. Internal opposition parties and the Contra rebels also have strongly criticized the new law. An administration source, who commented on condition he not be named, said the administration was particularly displeased that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> did not meet jointly with the opposition leaders to work out an agreeable election plan, instead meeting with them one at a time and then pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> proposal, a complaint also made by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members who sent the telegram. `` If <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> implements its <LOCATION> Esquipulas </LOCATION> commitments and holds free, fair and honest elections, I believe the emergency that prompted the prior administration to impose the trade sanctions would largely be resolved,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s letter reviewed the trade situation with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since the last administration report of Nov. 9. Those signing the congressional telegram include Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carper </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, D-Mo.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan.; <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, D-Ga.; <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunderson </PERSON>, R-Wis.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>, D-Md., and

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is seeking court permission to enter the complex of computer data, videotex, financial and other information services known as electronic publishing. A brief filed Friday with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said the leading firms in the electronic publishing industry `` are large, financially strong corporations'' that could withstand competition from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T also said there were other companies than <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, such as <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, to deliver data for the electronic publishers. The court order breaking up the old <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> had banned <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T from electronic publishing, but the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T brief said that in 1982 <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> stated he intended to lift the ban after seven years. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said the burden after seven years would be on any opponents of removal `` to show that competitive conditions clearly require the maintenance of the ban,'' <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's filing said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said the leading firms include <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- online database services -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- securities quotations and financial information -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> and TRW -LRB- credit data -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- videotex services -RRB-. <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> had no current plans to enter the electronic yellow pages and television businesses _ two areas that are of special concern to the seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies that were spun off from <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T in 1984 and to the broadcast and cable TV industries. `` We have no specific business plan in mind,'' <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said. `` We have no current plans to provide services via yellow pages, and this -LRB- court filing -RRB- is not motivated by any current plan to get into television.'' The company said `` There are now ` means other than <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's network for the transmission of the messages of electronic publishers,' and those firms providing electronic publishing services unquestionably have ` sufficient strength to permit them to compete.' Citing <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, it said `` it is beyond serious dispute that these carriers offer ample alternatives to all of the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T interexchange transmission services used by electronic publishers.'' <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> officials did not immediately return calls for comment. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, a spokesman for one of the seven regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies, <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, said company officials had not seen the filing and could not comment. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Videotex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said if <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T could be a `` potentially very important participant'' in electronic publishing, `` and I think probably the one area to watch out is if they use this as an opportunity to get into electronic yellow pages.'' Noting that the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies are banned from this area, he said a `` vacuum'' existed there. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s breakup order, as modified, defines electronic publishing as owning, originating, compiling or editing information content that is transported over <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's facilities. In 1987, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> gave the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies permission to transmit but not originate information services, which, besides electronic publishing, also include data processing and related computer services.

 <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> gave his approval Friday to a plan by federal scientists to wipe out tuberculosis in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the year 2010. `` I challenge you at <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> to carry out the strategies necessary to accomplish that goal,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in a speech to employees at the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The contagious lung disease attacked more than 22,000 Americans last year. TB can be cured in most cases with drug therapy, but has become a growing public health problem in recent years, in part because of the spread of AIDS _ which weakens the immune system, allowing TB, among other diseases, to develop. Scientists estimate that about 10 million Americans are infected with TB bacteria, but the vast majority never get the disease. The Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, created by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, calls for more effective use of existing prevention and control programs, development of new diagnosis and treatment techniques, and rapid transfer of new technology into widespread medical use. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who was president of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> before being appointed secretary of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, also visited the new national headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> compound.

 Firefighters quelled a brush fire that erupted Friday over 1,200 acres of the <ORGANIZATION> Pike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and forced the evacuation of more than 200 homes in scattered subdivisions near <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s foothils, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries or of damage to houses, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coultas </PERSON>, spokesman for the Woodmoor-Monument Fire Protection District. About 175 firefighters from 20 agencies converged on the area about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> after the blaze broke out shortly after noon in the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estates </LOCATION>, in unincorporated <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, he said. `` We do have it under control with 20 to 30 spot fires within the perimeter,'' he said. On Saturday, he said firefighters would overhaul the fire and finish the job. The cause of the blaze was unknown, he said. <PERSON> Coultas </PERSON> said structures in three subdivisions were evacuated in front of the fire burning grass, brush, scrub oak and pines. `` The terrain has given us more fits than anything else,'' <PERSON> Coultas </PERSON> said. `` Fire tends to move up and so it's following the contours of the land, moving up the side of the mountain.'' An air tanker was dropping fire retardant on the periphery of the blaze and helicopters were pulling water from Monument Lake to drop on the fire. Another air tanker was en route from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> to join the fire fighting. Officials said the rough terrain also was preventing workers from bringing in bulldozers to build fire lines, so axes and small hoses were being used. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesmen predicted it would take three or four days to quench the fire. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>'s rangeland fire danger was `` extreme'' as record high temperatures were reported Friday in eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and the fire danger was high in the mountains.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must pressure <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to stop the shelling that has killed hundreds in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and made life for the survivors virtually unlivable, according to 2,000 Lebanese who demonstrated across from the White House. `` It's a total breakdown of everything,'' said <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Rihani </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> consultant who visited her family in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in September. `` No work, no school, no electricity.'' `` It's unbearable, unpredictable, unlivable'' since Syrian forces began bombarding <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian enclave in early March, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, a Lebanese-born <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> businessman who also has relatives living there. `` It's inhumane to shell ... peaceful, innocent people,'' he said. The demonstrators came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and were organized by a variety of pro-Lebanese groups. Marching in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> across the street from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, they carried signs and sang the Lebanese national anthem amid chants of `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Save Lebanon.'' The International Movement for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION>, an organizer of the demonstration, said in a letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> it was disappointed by a statement by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> earlier this week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can do little at present to help <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters Thursday he wished there were `` some dramatic plan'' to stop the violence. `` The problem _ the short-run of it _ how you stop this firing, the shelling, how you get factions to stop warring, has certainly in recent times defied solution,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But we ca n't give up on it.'' Several demonstrators suggested the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could use diplomatic or economic pressure in an effort to force <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to withdraw its 40,000 troops from their country. At least 270 people, mainly civilians, have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded in shelling since March 8. More than 150,000 Christians and Moslems have fled <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> out of fear of fighting or due to shortages of food and fuel. <PERSON> Elia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> businessman who brought his 11-year-old son to the demonstration, said he believes that if <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> withdrew, the warring Lebanese religious and ethnic factions would find a way to form a workable government. `` A federation of religious, ethnic communities ... that's the ideal new <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that we're looking for,'' <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The rape and beating of a jogger has reinforced the reputation of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> as a haven for criminals, which city officials say is an unfair stereotype of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most famous urban park. `` Generally, crime in the park is low. It is safe to jog in Central Park,'' said police Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> after the Wednesday night attack by a marauding gang of teen-agers left a 28-year-old woman near death. `` There's danger in jogging anywhere,'' <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said. `` But we do n't feel it's inordinately dangerous here.'' The park's reputation for illegal activity has been reinforced in recent years by several highly publicized incidents: <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s 1986 strangling by `` preppie killer'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, a shooting a month earlier that left a police officer, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, paralyzed, and a 1983 free concert by <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> that drew packs of thieves. The victim of the latest attack, an investment banker, remained unconscious on life-support systems Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said hospital spokeswoman Aura Retamoso. The woman lost roughly three-quarters of her body's blood in the attack, and suffered a fractured skull, severe head lacerations, brain contusions, fractured facial bones and bruises from head to toe in the assault by a dozen teens, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, assistant chief of surgery at the hospital. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said that on Friday her pulse rate `` went way up'' when her mother spoke to her. `` So at some level she's processing information today which she was n't doing yesterday,'' he said. He said the next four days were crucial for her health, but added `` she has a fighting chance of making a full recovery.'' Seven teen-agers were arrested Friday and charged with attempted murder, rape and assault in the attack. Police said additional arrests were expected. <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said the woman was attacked by some members of a group of 32 teens who went to the park Wednesday night to `` raise hell, attack joggers, steal bicycles.'' Within 10 minutes, they had assaulted three men, including a jogger and a homeless man. They later split up into three groups after spotting a police cruiser and terrorized at least nine people during a two-hour period. <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said the youths told investigators the crime spree resulted from a pastime called `` wilding.'' `` It's not a term that we in the police had heard before,'' the chief said. `` They just said, ` We were going wilding.' In my mind at this point, it implies that they were going to go raise hell.'' `` Central Park is the focus of national attention. Every incident that happens there is news _ especially if it's grisly,'' Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said Friday. Last year, police had reports of 51 assaults and 13 rapes in the park, compared with 71,030 assaults and 3,412 rapes citywide. Of last year's attacks in the park, a dozen involved joggers; in 1987, 13 joggers were assaulted in the park. The rape Wednesday was the third rape reported this year in Central Park, police said. Officials say the crime reports for the park are low for an area larger than the country of <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION>. On a busy day, hundreds of thousands of people pass through the park. Officials acknowledge the park has dangers after dark. `` It's safer to use it by day,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said. But he said, `` People should n't give up on the park any more than you would give up on air travel because of a plane crash.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Runners </ORGANIZATION> club, tells evening joggers to avoid the northern area of the park, where the Wednesday attack occurred. That area, bordering on <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, has more rugged terrain and hiding places for criminals. <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>'s warning is based on history: One of his group's members was raped in almost the same spot while jogging through the park five years ago. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> also sounded a warning Friday about jogging: `` If you do it in some parts of this town, you're endangering your physical well-being, maybe occasionally even your life.

<TEXT>
 A sailor injured when missiles ripped into the USS Stark as it patrolled the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> says the $ 7,500 the government is trying to get him as compensation is insulting. `` All this for $ 7,500?'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>, who spent more than 11 hours in the gulf nursing his injuries and fighting off sharks following the May 1987 attack. `` I'm starting to wonder was it all worth it,'' he said. `` It'd be better off as far as compensation goes to go out and get in a car wreck. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> heard last month that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government had agreed to pay $ 27.35 million to the families of the 37 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sailors killed aboard the Stark, and thought he would be compensated as one of the 22 sailors injured. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> received a letter from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would seek $ 7,500 for his injuries from the Iraqis. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would not comment on the total amount being sought for the injured sailors. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> and the other sailors were injured when two Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi warplane hit the Stark in May 1987.

 A Burmese comedian and actor who satirized the military shortly after it seized power have been released after almost seven months imprisonment, authorities said today. The comedian, Zargana, and the actor, <PERSON> Zin </PERSON> <PERSON> Waing </PERSON>, were freed from Insein Jail in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Friday. Zargana, <PERSON> Zin </PERSON> <PERSON> Waing </PERSON>, and four other actors and directors were arrested Oct. 2 but never publicly accused of any wrongdoing. The others were freed earlier. <PERSON> Zargana </PERSON> said in a telephone interview today that he was kept in solitary confinement but was not otherwise mistreated. `` The authorities explained to us yesterday why the military had to step in on Sept. 18,'' <PERSON> Zargana </PERSON> said. `` We had to promise to avoid acts that tend to cause misunderstanding between the army and the public.'' Armed forces commander Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> seized power in a coup that day against the country's first civilian president in 26 years. The general's troops killed hundreds of people in crushing the nationwide street demonstrations for democracy.

<HEAD>Principal Removes Jars Of Fetuses From Seventh-Grader's Exhibit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A school principal prevented a seventh-grader from displaying her anti-abortion science project, which consisted of 10 jars of human fetuses, saying the award-winning exhibit was too much for his students. <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> placed the jars, which contained fetuses from pregnancy stages ranging from 6 weeks to 5 -LCB- months, on her exhibit table Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Pi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said Principal <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON>. `` To an untrained eye, the -LRB- fetus -RRB- 5 -LCB- months along was definitely a child,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, curriculum director for <LOCATION> Sevier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools. The girl said she got the fetuses, which were kept in preservative solutions, from her uncle, a pathologist. The girl's mother said the fetuses came from miscarriages <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> said he learned of the exhibit early that morning as students were setting up their projects for the school's annual science fair, which this year has the theme `` Life Science.'' `` The project was very inappropriate for the age group here,'' <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> said. He said he first conferred with <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who teaches art at the school. The project was removed from the fair after it was graded and given a blue ribbon but before classes had a chance to view it, said <ORGANIZATION> Sevier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> said he agreed with <PERSON> Cardiel </PERSON> that most of the schoolchildren were too young to understand the ideas and points behind the exhibit. <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> also said recent, nationwide political debate over abortion played no part in the principal's decision to yank the display from the fair.

 The transition from <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government to <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist administration is not going smoothly. Assassinations, bombings, death-squad style murders and mass roundups of leftists have further disturbed a political climate that has been roiled by nine years of civil war. Marxist-led guerrillas have vowed to make the country `` ungovernable'' by June 1, when <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> takes office. The 41-year-old leader of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, handily defeated the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate in last month's presidential election. Arena and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have blamed the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, for three recent assassinations of rightists and a bomb attack on the home of the vice-president-elect. Attorney General <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> was slain Wednesday by a bomb placed on the roof of his car when it stopped at a traffic light. The targeting of high-profile individuals _ a tactic not routinely employed by the guerrillas in the past _ appears designed to provoke and undermine <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. But who is doing it and why remain unclear. The guerrillas have neither claimed nor denied responsibility for the killing of <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. They did, however, deny responsibility for the April 14 bombing of vice president-elect <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>'s house Both <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> have blamed the recent wave of violence on guerrillas determined to provoke a harsh, repressive response from security forces. According to this view, guerrilla sympathizers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would point to a surge in rights abuse as reason for a cutoff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> receives about $ 1.5 million a day in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military assistance _ more than any other country in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. Some still-active Arena leaders have been linked to death squads that in the early 1980s killed thousands of suspected leftists. The insurgents continue to refer to <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> as `` the death-squad party.'' <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> denies the charge and <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> says the eight-year-old organization has evolved into a modern, conservative party similar to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> continues to harbor a far-right wing. Whether the <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> faction of relatively moderate and modern capitalists wins out over oligarchic and fascist-minded elements remains to be seen. `` An extremist sector of the right hopes to subjugate <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and impose a hard military and political line,'' <PERSON> Ignacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellacuria </PERSON>, rector of the prestigious Jesuit-run <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. Left-leaning unions and other `` popular organizations'' have condemned what they say is an increase in repression in recent weeks. Elementary school teacher <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> was abducted from her school, tortured and killed April 5 by heavily armed men in civilian clothes acting in broad daylight, apparently confident they would not be challenged by security forces. Police and army troops on Wednesday and Thursday raided a union headquarters, the headquarters of a displaced person's group and the offices of a women's association. More than 70 people were arrested. `` The escalation of repression demonstrates the desperation being felt by the rich and powerful. They're starting to feel the effect of the war and see their riches in danger,'' said <PERSON> Tomasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, a member of the directorate of the raided refugee center. `` So they declare war on the people.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said his government will act resolutely, but within the law, to ensure law and order. Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Vides </PERSON> <PERSON> Casanova </PERSON>, who met Thursday with lawmakers to discuss possible legislation to combat organizations considered guerrilla fronts by the military, said he does not believe the current level of violence requires the imposition of a state of siege.

 A Soviet skimmer swung into action Friday but collected no oil as a number of fishing boats waged their own, low-tech fight against <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s worst oil spill. While the 425-foot <PERSON> Vaidogubsky </PERSON> plied the rough seas off the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> shook his head in disgust over his 53-foot fishing vessel with its holds full of oil sucked from Resurrection Bay. `` I got all the evidence of the oil spill you could want right here,'' said <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Kasilof </LOCATION>. `` It's death and destruction. People look at it and it makes them sick.'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>'s boat, Sea Quest, was docked in a contamination zone of <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>'s small boat harbor while state and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials debated what to do with the 7,500 gallons <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said he sucked up in 16 hours Thursday. The Soviet skimmer spent Thursday testing its equipment and steamed for <LOCATION> Gore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> where large pools of oil have gathered. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohoe </PERSON> said the Soviet skimmer was to begin retrieving its first oil today. A total of 48 skimmers, most in the 36-foot to 42-foot range, were working on stretches of oil floating in <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Heaviest concentrations were in the sound, at <LOCATION> Gore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and on the west side of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Local fishermen have been pulling their boats up to oil contained by plastic booms, dipping the crude up with scoops and buckets and then stacking the buckets on the sterns of their boats. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> petty officer <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said delays unloading the oil were widespread and slowing progress on cleaning up the oil. He declined comment on whether more barges were needed and referred the question to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the oil company in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, said four barges in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and another near <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> had a combined capacity of almost 8 million gallons. Another barge was to join them, he said. Another Exxon spokesman, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON>, acknowledged there were long delays in loading recovered oil from skimmers onto the barges. He blamed that on the thick consistency of recovered oil, which he likened to taffy. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> also was under attack from environmentalists upset with the oil company's reluctance to open a sea otter treatment center at <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had written <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> strongly re-emphasizing the need for a second treatment center in addition to one at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said his agency first asked for a center April 7, and asked that it be completed by Sunday. `` We're not really in a position where we can order them to do it, but we finally felt compelled to put it in writing,'' he said. <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said the service is expanding its effort to rescue oil-coated otters off the outer coast of the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The Center for <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> estimated about 200 oiled sea otters have been found along the southern shoreline of the peninsula by fishermen. Altogether, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has observed 3,406 dead shore birds, 409 dead sea otters and four dead bald eagles. `` The devastation yet to come from the Exxon Valdez spill could be enormous,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based environmental group as he pressed for the second otter center. The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef March 24 and spilled 10.1 million gallons of oil it had loaded in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the southern terminus of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline. Delays in responding to the spill contributed to its spread, and some of the oil seeped out of the sound into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and moved southwest to the Kenai Fjords National Park. The ecologically sensitive region is home to large populations of marine mammals and seabirds. Biologists say thousands of birds and hundreds of sea otters have died, although an exact figure is unobtainable. The oil continued to spread southwest Friday to <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and beyond, said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, a spill cleanup coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> is the No. 1 fishing port in the nation as well as home of the world's largest concentration of brown bears, many of which are just emerging from winter hibernation.

 More than 100,000 students peacefully left <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on Saturday after staging 15 hours of protests demanding democracy and an end to dictatorship in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Student leaders decided to withdraw from the square at about 1:45 p.m. -LRB- 12:45 a.m. Saturday -RRB- after officials reopened the square to ordinary crowds that had swelled by the tens of thousands and become increasingly unruly. Earlier the students, raising their fists and chanting `` long live freedom,'' confronted the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership as they filed into a memorial service for ousted party leader <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> in the Great Hall of the People beside the square. The death of Hu, 73, from a heart attack last Saturday has sparked massive student protests. The students Saturday afternoon marched out of the square waving colored banners, calling for democracy and chanting `` arise citizens.'' Traffic was stopped along <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, the capital's main avenue, and people climbed trees to get a better view of the procession. The students said they would go back to their campuses and begin a boycott. They shouted `` Down with dictatorship!'' again and again. Demonstrators filled a street dividing the square from the Great Hall, which was guarded by a triple line of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers. Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s successor, delivered a 10-minute address at the memorial service. He said Hu `` worked unswervingly'' for the party and Marxist ideals during his 60-year revolutionary career, About 4,000 mourners, led by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and members of the Politburo, attended the ceremonies. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s body was draped in the red flag of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the mourners wore <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> jackets and trousers but <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was dressed in a Western suit. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> made no specific mention about <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s ouster, but said he was a man `` brave enough to admit his mistakes and to insist upon what he thought was right. He never tried to hold back his own opinions.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s `` unusual courage and resourcefulness'' in redressing the wrongs done to intellectuals and other citizens during the radicals' 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, walked around the casket and shook hands with <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s wife. The student rallies have filled Tiananman square since Monday and are much larger than pro-democracy demonstrations in the winter of 1986-87 that led to the ouster of Hu, an outspoken reformist. `` Long live democracy, long live freedom, down with bureaucracy, down with corruption!'' the students chanted as the officials entered the Great Hall. The students also yelled, `` Severely punish strong-armed tactics!'' a reference to purported police beatings of some students during a clash in front of the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Thursday morning. Chinese observers said the overnight demonstration on the square was one of the largest of its kind ever since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> victory over the Nationalists in 1949. Tens of thousands of students from about 30 universities, many bearing wreaths for <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> and pro-democracy banners, streamed into the square about Friday midnight, where up to 100,000 people had congregated during a day of rallies. The students gathered in circles centered around a wreath-laden monument to revolutionary heroes and sang, eulogized <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> and held debates about democracy. Some outspokenly criticized the Communist system. `` No one believes in Communism anymore,'' said one 34-year-old teacher. `` No one believes in the party. The party is strangling <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON>, activist in the short-lived 1978 Democracy Wall period of relative tolerance for democratic views, told one audience of about 2,000: `` People are praying for the awakening of a legal system ... This is a historical necessity. Democracy Wall lives again!'' Others critized <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> for holding onto power and demanded that Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> resign, saying he lacked ability for the job. At about 6:15 a.m. Saturday, a student leader announced to cheers that the authorities agreed to let the students remain in the square while the party memorial service took place in the Great Hall. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government on Friday announced that access to the Great Hall and the square would be restricted during the ceremony. Students feared police or soldiers would move in during the night to drive them out of the area. `` A victory for us. A big victory, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has backed down,'' said one jubilant student in the square. The students acknowledged, however, that authorities rejected a list of demands presented earlier in the week. They included more funding for education, public disclosure of the incomes of top leaders and an end to the ban on unauthorized demonstrations. Students said the most significant demand was for greater press freedom, a persistent theme during the demonstrations. The official press has given little coverage to the demonstrations except to report on alleged violent acts by demonstrators during Thursday's clash and issue warnings that those taking advantage of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death to promote anti-government activities will be punished. Tiananmen Square, a 100-acre plaza sided by the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the Great Hall and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s mausoleum, is the symbolic center of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Saturday's demonstration was the biggest since April 1976, when the death of Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> sparked a huge outpouring of grief and anger toward the leftist government. That `` Tiananmen Incident'' set off events that were to lead to the overthrow of the leftists and the end of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was widely admired by students for his work in redressing the wrongs done to intellectuals during that decade of chaos. He was ousted as party leader in January 1987 after party conservatives accused him of being soft on student demonstrators and the trend toward `` bourgeois liberalization.'' On Saturday, one government worker in the demonstration said of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, `` Our leader is old. Maybe he is crazy. Many people hope he will die.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> remains popular for his market-oriented reforms that have brought <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> some economic prosperity. But he has carried out only limited political reforms and does not tolerate opposition to one-party rule. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who was believed at one point to have chosen <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> as his successor, approved <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s ouster after pro-democracy demonstrations rocked the nation in December 1986 and January 1987.

 Hundreds of women wearing veils wait outside an abandoned schoolhouse for bags of flour and sugar to feed their families for the next two weeks. Their children huddle close by. Some clutch torn plastic bags and rusting buckets to carry the rations home; others simply stick out cupped hands. They are among the women and children in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> most affected by the 11-year civil war. Only the poorest of them are eligible for the emergency rations distributed by a U.N relief program called Operation Salaam, or Peace. Relief workers say they do n't know how much longer they will be able to help because their stockpile will be depleted by the end of April. `` We make no illusions that we are even able to begin to handle the need. We are not solving the problem,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>. Since February, relief workers have handed out 22-pound bags of flour and 6 -LCB- - pound bags of sugar, as well as some medicine and blankets, to about 33,500 families They also have provided fertilizer to farmers hoping to start planting crops in fields destroyed by fighting between Afghan forces and Moslem guerrillas trying to oust the Soviet-backed government. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was self-sufficient in food before civil war broke out following a Marxist coup in April 1978. The fighting has destroyed fields and orchards and forced the government to import about 1 million tons of wheat annually. Relief workers say fertilizer also will be gone within days. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> donated 175 tons of wheat and flour and about 235 tons of sugar to Operation Salaam. The Development Program is one of five <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> organizations involved in the relief effort. The others are the Aid Coordinator's Office, <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> Dozens of Soviet military transport planes descend daily on the capital from sunrise to sunset, but the blue-and-white aircraft each carry only about 25 tons of food and supplies. The rest of the cargo is weapons and ammunition. The Soviets ended nine years of intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when they withdrew the last of their troops on Feb. 15. Western countries that withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> before that time do not recognize the government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and have refused to help it. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> back the guerrillas, known as mujahedeen. Bread lines at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> bakeries that once stretched for blocks have eased, and there are plenty of fruits and vegetables in the markets. But food prices have risen dramatically and the poor can not afford them. The cost of 15 -LCB- pounds of flour has risen from about 40 cents in January to $ 3.25 today. Heavy snow and rebel attacks at times have cut off two vital supply routes to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a city of 2.2 million people _ the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway running north to the Soviet border and the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> highway east to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Fighting between government forces and the guerrillas closed the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway for nearly two weeks this month. A 1,300-truck convoy was stalled about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and dozens of containers of food rotted on the Soviet border. Convoys also have had trouble traveling between <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because of the guerrilla assault on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. The insurgents have pounded the city with heavy artillery and tens of thousands of rockets since March 6. The Soviet airlift has enabled the government to hold out against the guerrillas, but it supplies less than half the 650 tons of flour that <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> needs daily. Guerrilla leaders operating from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> originally said they would take power in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> within weeks after the Soviet pullout. However, government troops have managed to repulse their assaults on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, and diplomats say the insurgents now hope to starve major cities such as <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> into surrendering.

 An honor roll student searching for a way to protest his school's dress code found something his mother would think natty _ a bright red pair of her culottes. `` They're saying we ca n't wear shorts, but girls can wear skirts that are shorter than shorts, so they're indirectly discriminating against guys,'' said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was sent home Thursday when he showed up in school sporting the outfit. On Friday, five other boys joined his protest by going to school in skirts. School officials told them to change their clothing or go home. Two went home, while the others changed to pants and went to class, said principal <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON>. The School Board's student dress policy clearly states that culottes _ sometimes referred to as `` split skirts'' _ are permissible. The policy does not say that only girls can wear culottes to school. `` Culottes are for girls,'' Blocker said. `` The handbook does n't say that, but that's what is meant It might be sex discrimination, but it's disruptive to the school.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a member of the baseball team and captain of the soccer team, said he feels `` more comfortable in shorts than in jeans. I never wear long pants unless I have to.'' `` The kids in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> are allowed to wear shorts to school,'' he said. `` I guess they're a bunch of illiterate dropouts because of it.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a public hearing next week to consider changes to the student dress policy.

<HEAD>Late Actor's Companion Says AIDS Victims Must Warn Lovers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge said a jury's passion led it to give <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s lover an excessive $ 21.7 million in a landmark AIDS lawsuit, and he slashed the award to $ 5.5 million. `` It's still a big award,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, 35, who was reached by telephone Friday after <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Geernaert </PERSON>'s decision. Christian had sued the late actor's estate contending <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> should have told <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> he had the deadly and contagious disease. During the trial, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, a former bartender, testified in sometimes lurid detail that he continued to have sex unwittingly with <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> for months after the actor was diagnosed with AIDS. The jury ruled in February that <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> was guilty of `` outrageous conduct'' for concealing his AIDS diagnosis from Christian, his lover for two years. Although <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> did not contract AIDS and has tested negative for the presence of the virus, both the judge and jury found he deserved damages for the extreme emotional distress he suffered. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said he did n't learn of the star's illness until a few months before <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 58, died on Oct. 5, 1985. `` I thought I was a dead man,'' he testified about the terror that gripped him in the wake of the disclosure. Legal scholars said the ruling was unique in personal injury law concerning sexually transmitted diseases, because only plaintiffs who developed the diseases have collected damages in previous cases. In separate deliberations in February, jurors gave Christian $ 14.5 million in compensatory damages and $ 7.25 million in punitive damages. The judge upheld the verdict and said <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s conduct was `` outrageous and reprehensible'' because the actor and his secretary, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, agreed to keep <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s AIDS diagnosis secret. But in the 30-page order issued Friday, the judge said, `` The court finds that the jury's award of $ 14.5 million is so high that it must be concluded that the award is based in part on passion resulting from the jury's evaluation of the outrageous and reprehensible nature of the conduct of <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and defendant <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>.'' `` It is ... clear, that the emotional distress at issue here is the fear of contracting AIDS and, therefore, the fear of an agonizing death is very substantial whether measured in quantity or quality,'' <PERSON> Geernaert </PERSON> wrote. `` On the other hand, however serious -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- distress might be when he first learned of <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s AIDS, such emotional distress would become somewhat less over time. `` Furthermore, there is no evidence that plaintiff's emotional distress has been physically debilitating or that plaintiff has suffered any tangible economic loss,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> said he was happy with the outcome because it still sends a message to AIDS patients to inform their sexual partners if they have the disease. Christian's attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, who said he was disappointed by the judge's decision, said <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> accepted the reduction because he does not have the money to continue the court battle. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, an attorney for the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> estate, said he believes his clients will appeal. `` There's not any evidence I can see that would substantiate a $ 5 million award to this man,'' said <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Is Food And Water Life Sustaining Medical Treatment?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A family's decision to have a feeding tube removed from a 90-year-old, semicomatose stroke victim has rekindled a debate over whether it is humane to withhold food and water from terminally ill patients. For many doctors, cutting off the flow of nutrients through a tube is equivalent to pulling the plug on a respirator. But opponents argue that withholding food oversteps the line between allowing nature to take its course and actively ending a life. `` There is a line in many people's eyes,'' said <PERSON> Fenella </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, legal services director at the Society For The Right To Die in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which supports the right to cut off nutrition. `` I do n't think there's a practical difference,'' she said. `` I think there's an emotional difference.'' <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is among at least 39 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> that permit so-called `` living wills,'' in which people can declare whether they would want to refuse life-sustaining medical treatment if they became terminally ill, according to the society. But <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> is one of a handful of states with laws that specifically prohibit cutting off food from patients. `` Do we want to go around starving and dehydrating people to death?'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON>, legislative director for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Right to Life. The group has fought proposals to broaden the living will law to include nutrition and hydration, successfully defeating one effort last year. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fost </PERSON>, director of the medical ethics program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, said it is misleading to say patients starve to death. He says comatose patients can not experience hunger or thirst. `` Of course it's always hard to withdraw treatment,'' he said. `` It goes against natural medical impulses. But death is often in the interest of the patient.'' `` People should have the right to control medical care,'' concurs <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. Both doctors are supported by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which says it is ethical to discontinue life-prolonging treatment for patients facing imminent death or in irreversible comas. Such treatment `` includes medication and artificially and technologically supplied respiration, nutrition or hydration.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Right to Life insists that nutrition is different. A patient has a chance of surviving if a respirator is removed, she says, but cutting off food means certain death. Court rulings have been mixed in two states with laws that exclude the removal of food and water. In <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled this year that feeding tubes could be removed from a comatose patient, but spoon-and straw-feeding could not. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last year that the parents of a brain-damaged woman who is not comatose could not have the woman's surgically implanted feeding tube removed The case has been appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where it is pending. No one has been prosecuted for withholding food from a patient in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The woman died last year. But the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney's office is seeking advice from doctors about the case of the elderly stroke victim in an attempt to clarify the law. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> would n't comment on whether the department was considering filing charges. He said the department's main intention was to give doctors guidelines on what they can do under the law.

 Two farmers who claimed a neighbor's wandering bulls impregnated 32 of their heifers won a lawsuit, but got far less money than they sought to pay for abortions on the cows that were too young to have babies An <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury awarded damages of $ 640 to <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mieden </PERSON> on Thursday. The men had sued for $ 54,000. The $ 640, according to a veterinarian's testimony, would have covered the cost to administer abortion shots to the animals. The shots would have had no prolonged health effects. The trial pitting the Miedens against their neighbor, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON>, began Monday. The Miedens claimed that in late June and early July 1986, two of <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON>'s bulls jumped a fence and bred with 32 of the 86 heifers that were in an adjacent pasture. The Miedens claimed that the heifers were too young to be bred, and that they lost milk production because of the early pregnancies. <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> did not deny that his bulls were in the pasture with the heifers, but took the position that the Miedens could have done something to prevent damage to the heifers. He offered to have the heifers' pregnancies checked and to pay to have the pregnancies aborted. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mieden </PERSON> said four of the heifers were aborted by a veterinarian, four aborted on their own and calves delivered by the other 24 heifers died. Two heifers died while giving birth, he said, and others suffered damaged reproductive tracts because they were too young to deliver.

 Millions of tickets have already been bought for the chance to win the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lottery's jackpot of $ 70 million, which is sure to grow, but lottery officials are urging people not to splurge on tickets. The Super 7 jackpot, guaranteed to reach the $ 70 million mark by Wednesday's drawing, would break North American records, lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said Friday. Ticket sales for the Super 7 game have been booming, she said. Players bought nearly 7 million tickets Thursday and Friday. Lottery officials will continue to update the jackpot's value as sales continue, Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. Despite the temptation to buy as many tickets as possible to increase chances of winning, to do so would be futile, Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. `` The odds of winning the jackpot are one in 9.6 million for each ticket you buy,'' she said. `` There's no way you could cover it all.'' Players should only use extra money to buy tickets, not money they need to cover bills, food, clothing or other essentials, she said. `` We are after players' discretionary dollars, the same money they would spend buying a magazine or a candy bar,'' she said. If one person gets a ticket with seven of the 11 winning numbers, he or she would receive $ 2.69 million a year for 26 years. The Super 7 jackpot is guaranteed to reach $ 70 million because no one has bought a winning ticket for the past six weeks. That would surpass any of the lottery jackpots ever offered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said. Prior to the Super 7 jackpot, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lottery winnings were $ 69.9 million in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, split by four ticket holders on April 15. Before the $ 70 million prize, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s largest jackpot was $ 46 million in the Super 7 game, which was won by a <LOCATION> Hollidaysburg </LOCATION> couple on Oct. 14, 1987.

 A man accused of clubbing his mother with a crowbar and then stabbing her to death in a cocaine frenzy has been ordered to take powerful drugs that may make him competent to stand trial. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 29, who shouted and cursed when Circuit Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> issued the order Thursday, has the right to be spared `` thought-manipulating'' drugs, argued his lawyer, <PERSON> Ryal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudiosi </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> sided with state psychiatrists who said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s mental health probably would not improve without the drugs If after five years <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> still is not mentally competent to go to trial, criminal charges against him may have to be dropped, prosecutors said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was charged with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder after attacking his mother, his nephew and a passerby in April 1988. Police said he clubbed his mother with a crowbar before stabbing her, then attacked the others with the crowbar. <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was mentally incompetent to stand trial, and he was taken for treatment to the state-run <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in September. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> on Thursday for the authority to make <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> take anti-psychotic drugs aimed at altering his behavior. Dr. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilio </PERSON>, a psychiatrist who has been treating <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> that he wants to give <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> the drugs <PERSON> Trilafon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cogentin </PERSON>. The first is an anti-psychotic drug; the second is to counter possible side effects of <LOCATION> Trilafon </LOCATION>, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, drooling, involuntary muscle movements and even glaucoma. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> loudly opposed taking the drugs. `` I've done the best I can without any medicine,'' he told the court. `` I feel like they're trying to kill me. My behavior has been been outstanding since I've been in there. If you want to see me worse than what I am, then bring the medicine to me.'' But <PERSON> Perfilio </PERSON> said the proposed medication is `` the cornerstone of his treatment. The longer he is delusional, the more likely it will become permanent and fixed.'' That prospect, coupled with the potential that the state may have to drop charges, makes the medicine necessary, argued Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPorte </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> agreed to order <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> to take the drugs for three months, then report back to him. `` The benefits far outweigh whatever disadvantages there may be to the treatment,'' <PERSON> Carney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who was handcuffed and wore leg shackles, remained unconvinced. `` I'm not voluntarily taking any drugs,'' he insisted. `` I do n't even take ... aspirin.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> conference on disarmament that ended today gave unanimous backing to a global ban on chemical weapons, officials said. `` There has been a proliferation of chemical weapons and we have to be careful,'' said <PERSON> Yasushi </PERSON> <PERSON> Akashi </PERSON>, undersecretary-general for disarmament affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> `` We may not be able to close <PERSON> Pandora </PERSON>'s box.'' <PERSON> Akashi </PERSON> and others at the four-day conference noted that 20 to 30 countries now possess chemical arms, some of which were used most recently in the Iran-Iraq conflict that left more than 1 million people dead. There was universal agreement among the 100 arms control experts that a complete ban on chemical weapons should be negotiated at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent Conference on Disarmament in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Experts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 28 other nations gathered in <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION> for the conference, which was held in the only country to be the victim of nuclear attacks. In August, 1945, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped atom bombs on the western cities of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>. At the meeting, experts and officials clashed over the need for a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and on the policy of nuclear deterrence. Seismologists from around the world agreed that modern technology can produce highly accurate methods of detecting underground nuclear explosions, but said they needed political support and funds to build a global network of seismological monitoring stations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> advocated the policy of possessing nuclear arms to deter others from using them, while others noted their threatening and dangerous aspects. On Friday, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> told the assembly that despite unilateral reductions in Soviet troops and conventional arms to be carried out by next year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to stockpile nuclear arms to maintain global security. <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON> told reporters today that the next goal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in arms controls negotiations is the reduction of Soviet conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` To achieve an equal number for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -LRB- in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- will enable us to look to future nuclear reductions there,'' said <PERSON> Glitman </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator for the 1987 INF -LRB- intermediate-range nuclear missiles -RRB- treaty.

<HEAD>Alaska Congressman Wants `Spill Czar,' Fishermen Unhappy With Progress</HEAD>

 Two congressmen said they would push for a `` spill czar'' to take charge of any future oil disasters, but the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez spill remained fractious with fishermen demanding a bigger role. Forty-eight skimmers were gathering 100,000 gallons to 150,000 gallons of oil a day, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> estimated. But officials said Friday there were widespread delays in unloading the oil onto barges, which <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Beathard </PERSON> blamed on the crude's thick taffy-like consistency The giant Soviet oil skimmer Vaidogubsky, which spent two days getting ready and testing its booms, was poised at <LOCATION> Gore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, where large pools of oil washing westward have been stopped by a spectacular outcropping of rocks jutting into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. It was to begin collecting oil today. Heavy concentrations of oil also remained in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and were on the west side of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, more than 300 miles to the southwest. More than 300 miles of shoreline have been affected since the tanker ran aground in the sound last month and spilled 10.1 million gallons of crude. Delays in responding to the spill have contributed to its spread. Many fishermen frustrated at the lack of progress have taken to the sea themselves, using scoops and buckets to pick up oil contained with homemade booms. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, 29, said he sucked 7,500 gallons of oil and seawater into the hull of his boat. He said he fears his fishing boat may be permanently contaminated. At Homer on the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, angry fishermen demanded one of their own be given equal decision-making power with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in the cleanup. Reps. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., met Friday night with fishermen and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> `` We came out with a very positive outlook,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said without elaborating. The two congressmen toured oil-spotted beaches on the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> earlier in the day with <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. At a news conference, the two men said they would push for legislation to put one person _ most likely the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> _ in charge of cleaning up future spills Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> on Wednesday ended a weeklong stay in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> during which he rearranged the cleanup strategy, approved an <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> plan for the work and set a timetable for completion. The entire job is to be finished by mid-September. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the legislation he plans to introduce might include funding for one oil-skimming ship to be stationed in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> said it would be ideal to have skimmers in place on both coasts. He was a fire chief in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> port town of <LOCATION> Marcus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hook </LOCATION> when two foreign tankers collided there in 1975, burning and spilling 300,000 gallons. Young also vowed to spend money on research and push for the use of oil-dispersing chemicals, regardless of toxicity, in dealing with future spills. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> did n't attend the news conference. He left the congressmen to go to <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, home of the nation's No. 1 fishing port and the world's largest concentration of brown bears. Meanwhile, environmentalists attacked <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> over the company's reluctance to open a sea otter treatment center at <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION> The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had written <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> strongly re-emphasizing the need for a second treatment center in addition to one at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has counted 3,406 dead shore birds, 409 dead sea otters and four dead bald eagles.

 Hundreds of people gathered to honor the 47 sailors who died on the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> as victims of a tragedy that `` reaches into little towns all over the country.'' `` Words are never sufficient at a time like this to express the feelings that we share,'' <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leafe </PERSON> told the more than 750 people who came to Friday's memorial at the <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> waterfront. The 58,000-ton battleship was steaming toward its home port here and was to arrive Sunday. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators on board studied an amateur videotape for clues into Wednesday's explosion in the ship's No. 2 gun turret. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the explosion occurred as an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> officer was making a videotape to record the firing of the ship's big guns. <PERSON> Cudler </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials had not decided whether to release the tape publicly. Crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked out all the oxygen, according to a report in today's editions of The Washington Post. Maj. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, said he had no information on the causes of death. The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire the center gun, the newspaper said. After the fire was extinguished, crewmen worked quickly to remove the shells and powder from the other two guns, the newspaper said. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that the exact cause of the explosion may never be known because the devastation inside the turret was so complete. The top members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion. The Pentagon has ordered the 16-inch guns on all four World War II-era battleships silenced until the investigation is finished. Some critics have said the 16-inch guns are outmoded and dangerous. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 63, of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, said he attended the memorial because he considered the dead men his shipmates. `` I served aboard the battleship <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in 1946. I know about those big guns ... I know these things can happen,'' he said. `` At times like this, everyone seems to pull together. We become one family.'' <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Taplett </PERSON>, wife of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander, said she brought her 3-year-old son so he would always remember the men who died. `` I'm from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. ... When I heard that one of the men killed was from there, I had to come,'' she said. `` I guess I'm here for his parents Something like this touches all of us ... It reaches into little towns all over the country,'' she said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, a 23-year-old electrician's mate 3rd class from <LOCATION> Bison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, population 457, was among those killed. A wreath of 47 yellow carnations was cast into the river, a <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> police honor guard gave a 21-gun salute and a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bugler played taps at the 15-minute ceremony. `` On the USS Iowa, 47 young men died too soon ... We will remember, and honor and grieve as a nation,'' Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is planning a ceremony for the crew and family members Monday morning at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> scheduled to attend.

<HEAD>Eastern Scraps Shuttle Marketing Effort With Cabbies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Strike-bound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> says it has stopped a program that rewarded <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cab drivers for steering passengers toward its gates at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with $ 25 gift certificates and weekly prize drawings. Eastern dropped the 2-week-old campaign on Friday after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Taxi and <ORGANIZATION> Limousine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told the airline it was illegal. `` Once it was brought to our attention, it was discontinued,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, an Eastern spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the commission, said the shuttle incentive program for cabbies was `` against all rules,'' since taxi drivers should n't be induced to take riders where they do n't want to go. Eastern was giving cabbies a $ 25 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> certificate for every five loads of passengers they dropped off at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle terminal at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> There also was a weekly drawing for participating taxi drivers for a color television set, videocassette recorder or radio. `` We'd like to think that maybe the cabbies are doing some selling for us,'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said earlier Friday. He noted that around half the passengers coming to <ORGANIZATION> LaGuardia </ORGANIZATION> arrive by taxi. Eastern's hourly among <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been running a normal schedule, compared with only 10 percent of pre-strike flights for the airline as a whole. Passenger loads have been decimated, however, as the rival shuttle operated by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has eaten into Eastern's traffic. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> once used an incentive plan to encourage cabbies to pick arriving passengers up at its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> terminal when the airline started its shuttle service in late 1986, spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said, but the program was n't illegal. She said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has captured around 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle market, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s taxi program appears to have had no impact. In another development, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> property developer confirmed through an associate Friday that he is interested in buying Eastern. `` We've expressed our interest; it's sincere and we're pursuing it,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarpa </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Hadid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Roslyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The company is run by <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadid </PERSON>, who recently agreed to buy the Ritz-Carlton hotels in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Attorneys for Eastern and its striking unions recently said there are four serious offers for the airline, which has been grounded by a walkout since March 4. It filed for bankruptcy protection five days later. They said the bidders are ex-baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, whose $ 464 million deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> collapsed last week; takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>; billionaire hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON>; and an unnamed suitor. But <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent's <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, insisted earlier this week that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is n't for sale and that there is no serious fourth bidder.

 Communist rebels today claimed responsibility for the ambush-slaying of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer, and said it was in retaliation for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' `` arrogant trampling'' of Philippine independence. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> prisoner of war, was killed Friday by a shot to the head when gunmen in a stolen car sprayed his vehicle with bullets while he was on his way to work in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION>. The communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility in a statement delivered to news agencies. The letter bore the logo of the rebel army and was released on behalf of its chief, <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintanar </PERSON>. The statement threatened further attacks if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues support of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s fight against the 20-year Communist insurgency. `` The death of Col. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> signifies the firm commitment of the revolutionary forces to continue military actions against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel and installations as these are manifestations of the arrogant trampling of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists on the Filipino people's independence and sovereignty,'' the statement said <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, 51, was chief of the ground forces division of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which provides training and logistical support to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was a decorated Vietnam War hero who was held in a cage for five years by the <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> as a prisoner of war until he escaped in 1968. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> called the killing a `` cowardly'' act. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government will work with the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government `` to track down and bring to justice those responsible for this assassination.'' Police said they recovered the assailants' car and traced it to a Filipino civilian who said it was stolen on April 7. Cartridges from bullets used in the killing littered the vehicle, police said. Police said up to three cars may have been used in the ambush, but witnesses said they saw only one carrying at least three men, a driver and two gunmen. One gunman had an M-16 rifle and the other a .45 - caliber pistol, police <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s Filipino driver was wounded in the attack. It came five days after the communist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said the rebels were `` determined to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialism pay dearly for the continuing stay of its bases and its escalating intervention in our people's affairs.'' The statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications station in the northern province of Benguet on April 9. No one was hurt. In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino outside <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Authorities then increased security at six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations and civilian offices in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> today ordered additional security for the 1,000 sailors on the flagship USS Blue Ridge of the 7th Fleet. The ship arrived Friday for a four-day port call. Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, the fleet's spokesman, said the sailors were told, among other things, to travel in groups and stay away from dark alleys. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Friday that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> travel advisory issued March 15 `` indicates areas of the country where, because of criminal activity or terrorist activity, people should try to avoid.'' The advisory says most urban areas in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> including <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> are safe for travelers. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> indicated the advisory might be revised. `` I'm sure that will be looked at,'' he said. `` I would note that the threats that I have heard about were against official Americans, and were n't general threats to travelers.

<HEAD>Attorney General: Mecham Can Run Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> can run for public office again despite the impeachment and conviction that ousted him a year ago, the attorney general said. `` Naturally ` I'm happy about it,'' said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who has already announced a 1990 gubernatorial bid. `` It's what we thought it should be,'' he told television station <ORGANIZATION> KPNX </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. The opinion issued Friday by Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> is nonbinding and could be challenged in court, but political leaders from both parties said they would n't challenge it. `` I think this issue should be settled by the voters of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fife </PERSON> <PERSON> Symington </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who has announced he will run against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in next year's <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was free to run becafice in the future. The impeachment and conviction did not disqualify <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> automatically, he said. His attorney, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> originally had intended to `` take this question of the ` Dracula clause' to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> regardless of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s opinion.'' The Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ousted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on April 4, 1988, by more than the required two-thirds vote. But by a vote of 17-13 _ three short of a two-thirds majority _ the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> failed to invoke the so-called `` Dracula clause'' that would have driven a political stake through <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s heart and barred him from holding office again. Some legal scholars have said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> might not have needed to vote on the clause because the state's constitution speaks of ouster and disqualification in the same sentence. And even if a separate vote was required, they said, a simple majority such as 17-13 might be enough. But in his 11-page opinion, <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> said those who wrote the state's Constitution expected that there would be separate votes on ouster and disqualification. Political leaders from both parties welcomed the opinion and said it would be better to let <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> go ahead with his campaign for 1990. `` I think he ought to be able to run,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON>, a Republican who voted to oust <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> but also voted against the `` Dracula clause.'' `` I think it'd be better that he not be martyred,'' Usdane added. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, a Democrat who also voted for impeachment and against the `` Dracula clause,'' said <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>'s ruling `` is the right decision. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> following his ouster, said the attorney general's opinion would not change her plans to run for governor in 1990. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was elected on his fifth try for governor in 1986 and was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after barely a year in office. The articles of impeachment charged <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> with concealing a developer's campaign loan, misusing state money and obstructing justice. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on the misuse of funds and obstruction charges but deferred the obstruction charge to <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where he was acquitted. <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> still plans to ask the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> next month to set aside the impeachment. `` We still have high hopes of either having the articles of impeachment dismissed, which would put Gov. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> immediately back in office, or having a new trial declared,'' <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Spill Downgraded; Employee Not Certfied, Says Coast Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAYOU SORREL, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fears for a fragile bayou environment were receding after officials downgraded the estimated size of a spill of oil-tainted water to no more than 10,000 gallons. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said an employee who was transferring the waste water from a barge when the spill occurred lacked proper certification. The spill of so-called `` slop water'' occurred early Friday on a loading dock on <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, about 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayweather </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> GSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> in nearby White Castle. The barge was carrying 900,000 gallons of waste water from an Exxon plant in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. It buckled in the middle while the waste was being unloaded into tanker trucks, <PERSON> Mayweather </PERSON> said. Authorities said the spill was quickly contained and that a cleanup would continue today. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had paid GSX to treat and dispose of the waste at White Castle, <PERSON> Mayweather </PERSON> said. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kutz </PERSON> said one of the companies or an individual could be assessed civil penalties for conducting the transfer without proper documentation. Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doss </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GSX </ORGANIZATION> employee <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vice </PERSON> did n't have the required <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> certification for the job. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, facility manager for the GSX recovery unit in <LOCATION> Crowley </LOCATION>, confirmed that Vice was manning the operation when the spill occurred, but he declined to comment further. GSX is assuming responsibility for the cleanup, <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> said. The barge was leased by GSX and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had no responsibility for the shipment after it left the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site, said <LOCATION> Iberville </LOCATION> Parish Sheriff <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitre </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubois </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the barge, said waste water is used to wash out tanks and ships. <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said that according to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the waste was about 90 percent water, 7 percent alcohol and 3 percent light oil. State Police initially estimated the spill at up to 400,000 gallons, while GSX estimated it at 180,000 gallons. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> downgraded the estimate late Friday to about 10,000 gallons. No one was injured in the accident, but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said a small number of fish were killed at the outset. `` It looked like a giant had stepped on the barge smack in the middle,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` Oil-absorbing booms were in place shortly after the spill and we believe most of the waste was confined to the immediate area of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` Things could have been an awful lot worse but because of the waste involved and the quick response by <ORGANIZATION> Iberville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> officials, we've got a good handle on the situation,'' he said.

 An escaped mental patient who doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire in front of a closed abortion clinic had been arrested twice during previous protests there, a clinic official said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON>, 26, was in critical condition early this morning with third-degree burns over his entire body at the <ORGANIZATION> Vanderbilt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> burn center, hospital spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` The doctor said his prognosis is not good,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrell </PERSON>, administrator of the clinic, said Friday <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> had been arrested at the clinic during anti-abortion protests. `` He was arrested for illegally entering the clinic, trying to disrupt the operations. We could not prosecute him, because he would have been judged incompetent to stand trial,'' <PERSON> Ferrell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> escaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> sometime Friday, said <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> police detective <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON>. `` My understanding is that he was at the mental health institute because he suffered from delusions that he could fly,'' <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> fire marshall investigating the attempted suicide found anti-abortion pamphlets on the man, <PERSON> Fuqua </PERSON> said. `` A nurse asked him if he did this as a protest and he nodded,'' he said. <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> was committed to the institute by General Sessions Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faimon </PERSON> after leaping from the balcony of a downtown shopping arcade in June 1988 in what police described as a suicide attempt. He suffered a severe broken arm and severe head injuries, The Tennessean reported in today's editions. The <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> morning newspaper also reported <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> had escaped at least three times before and left the institute Friday during visiting hours. Two <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> firefighters at a station across the street saw <PERSON> Valiquette </PERSON> walk up to the clinic but realized what he was doing too late to stop him. `` He reached in his pocket, came out with a <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> lighter, flicked it and was a human torch right before my eyes,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON>, a firefighter and emergency medical technician. The two firefighters then drove an engine into the street. `` We pulled off the hose and extinguished him, put burn sheets over him and administered oxygen,'' <PERSON> Cage </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ferrell </PERSON> said the clinic closed for renovations on Feb. 24 after state inspectors found numerous violations of fire and health regulations. <PERSON> Ferrell </PERSON> said he hopes the clinic can reopen next week. After being the target of numerous anti-abortion protests, the clinic obtained a court injunction limiting the number of protesters, <PERSON> Ferrel </PERSON> said. `` I'm really sorry this happened, this is something that all of us sure want to avoid,'' <PERSON> Ferrell </PERSON> said. `` For any sound thinking person, they will realize this person was incompetent, I think, and it should have no effect on pro-abortion or anti-abortion debate,'' <PERSON> Ferrell </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Demonstrators gathered today to protest a nearby white supremacist conference, but many people who oppose racism stayed away out of fear of violence. Law enforcement officers, meanwhile, made plans to head off any potential confrontations between the two groups. As many as 2,000 demonstrators were expected to march in the seven-mile `` Walk for Racial Equality,'' which is planned to end two miles from the Aryan Nations compound, site of the conference of neo-Nazi youths. Sheriff's deputies and officers from the <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> planned a show of force around the anti-racism marchers to discourage confrontations. `` We've established what we feel to be tactics that are going to ensure the safety of all the parties involved,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON>. Fewer than 100 neo-Nazi youths were believed to be staying at the 30-acre ranch of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jesus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aryan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, a white supremacist organization that wants to turn the Northwest into a `` whites only'' homeland. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said white supremacist leaders, including <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> officials, will speak and conduct workshops. Sheriff's deputies set up checkpoints Friday on roads leading to the camp a few miles north of <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION> to check identifications of people entering the area. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, organizer of <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nonviolent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racism </ORGANIZATION>, the Coeur d'Alene-based group sponsoring the march, said she expected few problems. Although the march has been endorsed by the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, The New Jewish Agenda and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, groups such as the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'rith were staying away. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, regional <ORGANIZATION> ADL </ORGANIZATION> director in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said his group was concerned about placing an additional burden on law enforcement and a potential for violence. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> also refused to endorse the march, saying it could promote violence and give the neo-Nazis more publicity. In a statement issued Friday, <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> lashed out at the skinheads. `` The people of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> stand united against hate groups and those who would spread a message of fear and intolerance,'' he said. Leaders of organizations formed during the past decade to combat the Aryan Nations planned a picnic and other events a few miles away from the white supremacist gathering. `` We think that a march just does them too much honor and respect,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Kootenai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Human Relations.

 As many as 150,000 students and their supporters, waving fists and chanting `` Long live freedom,'' demonstrated today against the Communist system as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders watched from behind a wall of soldiers. Facing more than 8,000 troops, students shouted, `` Down with dictatorship, down with corruption!'' while top members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy filed out of a funeral for ousted party chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. The protest in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the symbolic political center of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was one of the clearest rejections ever of the Communist system by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s increasingly disaffected youth. It also marked the culmination of a week-long commemoration of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death last Saturday. During 15 hours of demonstrations that featured no major incidents, the students waved colored pro-democracy banners and turned the plaza into a sea of red and white banners. The students confronted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders as they filed into a memorial service for Hu in the Great Hall, chanting anti-government slogans. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, who died of a heart attack, was 73. The turnout was one of the largest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> victory over the Nationalists in 1949, and the biggest in 13 years, when the death of Premier <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON> sparked an outpouring of grief and anger toward the leftist government and an end to the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. But major differences with the bloody, spontaneous 1976 protest remained. Today's protest left few people injured and was well organized. The government has rejected all the students' demands, including greater freedom of speech and press, more money for education, disclosure of the incomes of top officials and reassessment of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s historical role When the students ended their demonstration, they departed peacefully in groups that represented about 30 universities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities. In <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, about 1,500 people marched through downtown, also to commemorate <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death. Earlier today, about 2,000 students marched on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, the traffic was stopped along <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>, the capital's main avenue, and people climbed trees to get a better view of the procession. The students said they would go back to their campuses and boycott classes. When the 4,000 officials attending the ceremony started to arrive this morning, the students let out a roar, waved their banners and raised their fingers in V-for-victory salutes. Some officials, protected by a triple line of military troops, stopped momentarily to listen. During the ceremony, party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> praised his predecessor, saying `` as a Marxist, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> led a glorious life.'' <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was forced to resign in disgrace in January 1987 after being accused by party conservatives of being soft on student demonstrators and Western liberal ideas. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s 10-minute speech, before a large portrait of Hu draped in black bunting, made no specific mention of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s ouster and did not, as demanded by the students, attempt to reassess <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s performance. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> said only that <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was a man `` brave enough to admit his mistakes and to insist upon what he thought was right. He never tried to hold back his opinions.'' Some of the aging ideologues who are believed to have engineered <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s ouster did not attend the ceremony. Among those absent were former President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>, former Politburo member <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yibo </PERSON> and former party propaganda chief <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Liqun </PERSON>. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, 84, looking tired and fragile, circled the glass-encased casket and shook hands with <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s family and wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s body was clad in a Western suit and draped with a red Communist Party flag. Flags were flown at half-staff on <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, scene of a clash between demonstrators and police earlier this week. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 1 million people, some in crowds five deep, lined the streets to watch the motorcade that carried <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s body to the Babaoshan state cemetery in western <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for cremation. It said people carried banners reading `` farewell, <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>'' and `` <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, we'll always remember you.'' <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s speech was broadcast over loudspeakers on the square but the students paid little attention. As soon as he finished they resumed their chants of `` long live democracy.'' As officials descended the steps of the Great Hall, they shouted: `` we demand dialogue!'' and `` come down <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>!'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s premier, is a technocrat regarded as lukewarm toward economic and political reforms. He has said that social stability must take priority in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and that `` excessive democracy'' would harm the nation. Unlike the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which has held direct parliamentary elections and given its press greater freedom, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has taken the lead in economic reforms. It has taken only small, cautious steps to make its political system more open.

 The man identified as the principal suspect in a dozen drug-related torture slayings in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border denied he was the killer but said he may have information on the deaths, officials said. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgueno </PERSON>, 45, was held without bond Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> after his arrest late Thursday at a mobile home in an isolated area about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. `` He's the principal one, according to the witnesses,'' said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecena </PERSON>, zone commander with the <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> of the Mexican state of <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>. Mexican federal and state authorities will file formal requests for <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> special agent, said <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> `` has made statements extricating himself from any culpability in the murders in <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>. However, he has said that he may be able to provide information that authorities are not aware of.'' <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> was found with a woman identified as his wife, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON>, deputy chief agent for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> was being held as an illegal alien under a federal immigration arrest warrant. His wife could be voluntarily deported to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> owned the ranch near the Mexican border town of <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> where the bodies were found on March 29 and April 1. He had shaved his moustache, changed his hair style and altered his eyebrows, but `` it did n't help him. We recognized him right away,'' said <LOCATION> Pima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sheriff </LOCATION>'s Maj. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> said investigators found <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> after getting various tips, including some from a local crime hotline and from the TV show `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' which had a segment Sunday on <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON>. Authorities were investigating whether the <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> killings were linked to the slayings of five people whose bodies were found in a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> shed shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Agua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prieta </ORGANIZATION> bodies were discovered. <PERSON> Cecena </PERSON> said 11 of the <ORGANIZATION> Agua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prieta </ORGANIZATION> victims apparently were killed after they witnessed the murder of one person. The <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> has an extensive arrest history, ranging from drug and weapons violations to assault, sexual assault and robbery. Like the unrelated ritual slayings of 15 people in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION> discovered last week, authorities consider the <ORGANIZATION> Agua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prieta </ORGANIZATION> killings to be drug-related.

<TEXT>
 Residents angered by government-imposed price increases defied a curfew and rioted in this town near <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> today. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> cut short an overseas trip and headed home from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Eight people have been killed in the violence that began Tuesday, and the presidents of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s professional associations called on <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to withdraw the armed forces from towns and villages to prevent further bloodshed. They said in a statement that the government had set a bad example in implementing austerity measures and called for elections for a new government. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> will return to the worst unrest in his country since his army put down violence by Palestinian guerrillas in 1971. The rioting began Tuesday in the south, the bedrock of his support, in response to price increases of 10 percent to 50 percent on gasoline, cigarettes, heating oil and other commodities. By Thursday night the violence had spread to the north. On Friday, rioters in the northern town of Salt threw rocks at police and looted buildings. They shouted support for <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, but called for the ouster of Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON>, whom they blame for austerity measures and declining living standards. After the rioting, children played inside shattered offices, and hundreds of people milled around on the glass-strewn streets in the city of 100,000 about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported in today's riots. `` We are fed up with this government. They have stolen all our money,'' said a man in his 60s who refused to give his name. He said demonstrators `` trust the king's leadership and we know he will respond.'' King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who was on a state visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, canceled his trip to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> that was set for today and because of the rioting instead will return home, the <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. The first riots occurred in the southern city of <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION>, where the government said four civilians and one police officer were killed. Three other people were reported killed in <LOCATION> Mazar </LOCATION>, 55 miles south of <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>. On Friday, troops banned Moslems from attending weekly prayers in mosques in <LOCATION> Maan </LOCATION> and other southern cities in an attempt to prevent more unrest. Cancellation of Friday prayers is highly unusual in an Islamic country. The Koran, <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy book, calls on Moslems to participate in the ceremony, and most take it as a binding duty. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> broadcast an appeal to <LOCATION> Jordanians </LOCATION> on Friday night to end the violence, and for the first time showed pictures of smashed buildings and destroyed vehicles. `` These are the services which the government tried to provide for the whole country, and we paid with our tears and with our sweat and with our blood to have them built,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> director who narrated the 20-minute program. `` These were destroyed by a bunch of terrorists.'' <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> said the damage only would add to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s economic problems `` because now we have added pressure.'' The government announced the price increases Sunday as part of an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to reschedule <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s $ 6 billion foreign debt. They came on top of rising unemployment and soaring inflation. Israeli radio and TV reported the difficulties `` to instigate problems,'' <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> said, and `` news agencies are exaggerating the picture of the situation.'' Government officials earlier hinted that Moslem fundamentalists had inflamed the unrest. Most of the rioting has involved native Jordanians, not the Palestinian half of the population.

<TEXT>
 Syrian forces today fired rockets into the port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, the only escape route for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s beleaguered Christians No casualties were reported as sporadic 122mm Soviet-designed Grad rockets exploded around <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and the coastal highway running north to the ancient port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION>. The attack came during a three-day lull in the battle between the Syrians and allied Moslem Druse militia and the mainly Christian units of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fractured armed forces under army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. By police count, at least 270 people have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded in ferocious artillery, rocket and tank exchanges that began March 8 in the divided capital. Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported that an estimated 4,000 Christians were gathered at <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> to await ferries from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, 130 miles to the northeast, to take them to safety. The 4,000-ton <PERSON> Baroness </PERSON> <PERSON> M </PERSON>, one of two ferries that have carried 12,000 Christians to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in the last six weeks, was anchored off <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> on Friday night. It took 1,200 people from <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> in small boats. The other ferry, the <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> Rose, suspended its <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> run three days ago after it came under Syrian shelling near the lebanese port. Cypriot shipping officials said it was not known when the next ferry will sail for <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem-controlled Voice of the Nation today termed the Syrian rocketing a warning to ships to stay away from the besieged enclave. `` It will persist as long as the blockade imposed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> perists,'' it said. The latest fighting broke out two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, seeking to restore state authority, blockaded illegal ports south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> run by Moslem militias. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave, which is ringed on the three landward sides by hostile forces, have not returned the Syrian fire since most fighting died down late Wednesday.

 Automatic teller machines helped police track down a winery worker accused of murdering seven people, including his wife and two daughters. The <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to extend unlimited credit to <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> and arranged to track him through any transactions made with his automatic teller card, said Sheriff <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON>. A tip from <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s sister and brother-in-law in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> also helped authorities find him, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> reported today, citing unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and law enforcement sources. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, 28, who also is accused of killing his mother-in-law and her two daughters and a co-worker at the winery where he was a forklift operator, was arraigned on murder charges Friday after being captured in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> was reported to have run out of bank funds last week while on a cocaine-and-alcohol binge that friends said preceded the April 14 slaughter. He tried to use a bank card at least once at a <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> branch that morning in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION>, 30 miles south, and possibly again later in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> while heading for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, authorities said. The manhunt ended Wednesday when <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> was arrested in western <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near his hometown of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the sheriff's department, citing a gag order imposed by a judge on Friday, would not comment on the report about family members tipping off police. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, who also is charged with three counts of attempted murder, appeared in court Friday in handcuffs and a bulletproof vest. He did not enter a plea but will return to court May 5. He could get the death penalty if convicted. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s attorney, Chief Public Defender <PERSON> Marteen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> would enter a plea of innocent by reason of insanity. He added that he would have his client undergo psychiatric and neurological tests. `` I expect to find some brain lesion or tumor,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who called the crimes, `` so bizarre, so incomprehensible.'' `` God, I hope I find something,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who also planned to ask that the trial be moved because of all the publicity the case has received. The prosecutor, however, discounted speculation that the rampage was fueled in part by alcohol and cocaine us and said he believed <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> is legally sane. `` The final decision about his state of mind will be made in court,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunney </PERSON>. `` Those were not the acts of an irrational berserker.'' After his arrest, <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> told Mexican television reporters and law enforcement agents he killed his American-born wife, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, 24, and a winery co-worker, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Toovey </PERSON>, in a jealous rage, believing <PERSON> Toovey </PERSON> and his wife were romantically involved, according to federal officials. Also killed in the series of attacks across the <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> 40 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s mother-in-law and his two sisters-in-law, 8 and 12. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> also is accused of killing two daughters, 1 and 4, who were found dead at a dump April 15. Their throats had been slashed. Another daughter, <PERSON> Carmina </PERSON>, who turns 3 on Monday, also was found at the dump with a slashed throat but is recovering and has identified her father as her attacker, police said.

 Suspected communist guerrillas attacked the homes of two government militiamen in the southern <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> today. Seven people, including three children and one militiaman, were killed, police said. A police report said the attack, with automatic rifles and grenade launchers, occurred in the remote town of <LOCATION> Sindangan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> province, 40 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Pagadian </LOCATION> and 460 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>.

Seven occupants were killed and five were wounded, including the militiaman who survived, he said. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> said government militiamen owned the homes and that the attack was in retaliation for their participation in the government's campaign against the rebels. The insurgents took away the militiamen's farm animals, he said. In nearby <LOCATION> Zamboanga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province, two militiamen were killed Friday when about 200 rebels attacked the town of <LOCATION> Mahayag </LOCATION> and held residents for nearly one hour before escaping, a military report said. It said the rebels issued a challenge to soldiers in the area and fought with them for 30 minutes. In another attack Friday, rebels killed two militiamen in the town of <LOCATION> Molave </LOCATION> in adjoining <LOCATION> Misamis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oriental </LOCATION> province, the military said.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said today that the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade union probably will get smaller as other independent groups form in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` From Solidarity, other economic and political organizations will be born,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said at a news conference ending his three-day visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` Solidarity for the moment is huge but it will become smaller with the growth of other organizations. This is the logical course of events.'' The Polish independent trade union was crushed by security forces in 1981 and outlawed in 1982. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist government restored the legality of Solidarity on Monday after reaching agreement with the Solidarity-led opposition on political and social reforms. The government is seeking support from Solidarity and aid from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to restore its shattered economy. Coinciding with the official recognition of Solidarity, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced a $ 1 billion economic aid program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the program was `` a great step forward taken by Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, indicated he planned to visit other countries as an `` ambassador of Solidarity'' but did not say which ones. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> seeking economic investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the blessing of fellow Pole Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> for the country's new political course. The Solidarity leader said he would like to see the pope make another trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had many obligations. `` And because we love him, we will spare him,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` For this reason, we told him not to worry so much about <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ we have reached these accords, worry yourself less. It's clear, though, that he wo n't listen to us and will continue to be concerned.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> received a $ 378,000 loan in 1987 from the company at the center of a growing bribery scandal, Japanese news media reported today. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who heads the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, received the loan from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and repaid it several months later, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said. They said officials in <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s office confirmed the loan but did not disclose the terms of its repayment. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> did not mention the loan when he told a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> committee on April 11 that he had received more than $ 1 million in political donations from Recruit between 1985 and 1987. Recruit, an information services company, is suspected of using political donations and other financial transactions to gain favors from politicians and bureaucrats. Although pressure on <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to step down to appease public and opposition criticism over the scandal has grown in the past week, a lack of strong candidates untainted by the scandal makes <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation problematic. Virtually none of the most influential <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders could take over from <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasaki </PERSON>, political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a leadership vacuum. There's literally nobody powerful who has not been tainted by the scandal,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The opposition is demanding that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resign and that former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> testify in Parliament on his own role in the Recruit affair. A survey by the nationwide newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> released Friday showed that 35.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> responding to the poll think <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> should resign. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> are among 17 politicians who reportedly benefited from unlisted, cut-rate shares in a real-estate subsidiary of Recruit. The shares, sold by the company to about 160 influential politicians, public officials and businessmen, produced substantial profits for the recipients after over-the-counter trading began in October 1986. Although the transactions were not illegal, they aroused suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling. The result was an outcry over fund-raising practices and the cozy relationship between businessmen and politicians.

<HEAD>High Court Considers Limiting Women's Right to Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hears arguments this week on limiting _ or even ending _ women's abortion rights, but the battle is sure to continue no matter what is decided in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case before the justices. The dispute over the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion-regulation law, for which arguments will be conducted Wednesday, has become one of history's most closely watched high court cases There are two reasons: _ <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are urging the court to use the case to overturn or substantially limit the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion _ Even if the court does not accept that invitation and decides the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case narrowly, the decision _ expected in July _ will be viewed as a barometer of the current court's commitment to the 16-year-old ruling in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> `` If <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> is reversed, the nation's whole political landscape could change,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` State by state, our goal would be obtaining a legislative right to abortion, making the lack of any constitutional right irrelevant.'' She added: `` It no longer would be acceptable for any politician to be anti-choice.'' Reversal of the 1973 ruling would allow states to more stringently restrict access to abortions, or even ban virtually all abortions. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON>, general counsel of the anti-abortion <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> is doomed at some point in the foreseeable future but the pro-choice people are laying the legal groundwork for other attacks on restrictions, already arguing that they amount to gender-based discrimination or involuntary servitude.'' And if the 1973 decision emerges unscathed by the court's decision in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case `` We -LRB- in the pro-choice movement -RRB- would still be vulnerable,'' <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said in a recent interview. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, director of education for <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` Reversal by 1992 is part of our strategic plan. If not in -LRB- the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case -RRB-, then in the next'' she said. `` We want to keep as many cases in the pipeline as possible.'' <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>'s apprehension and <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>'s confidence stem from changes in the high court's membership since it ruled, by a 7-2 vote, in 1973 that women have a constitutional right to abortion. Only three members of the original <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> majority remain _ Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Each has supported the 1973 decision in subsequent rulings. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who joined the court in 1975, is a dependable `` pro-Roe'' ally. The two 1973 dissenters, now-Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, still oppose the ruling. Any significant retreat from <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> will have to attract the court's three most junior justices _ <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. All are appointees of former president <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, an outspoken critic of the high court's abortion rulings. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> criticized the rationale of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> while dissenting from a 1986 decision striking down certain abortion regulations in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. But it is unknown whether she disagrees with the core holding of the 1973 decision _ that women have a fundamental right to abortion. <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> have not yet ruled in any abortion case, but many believe both favor cutting back abortion rights. `` Justice <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> is the key,'' <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said. `` We wrote our -LRB- friend-of-the-court -RRB- brief to speak to <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NARAL </ORGANIZATION> legal director who wrote the brief, said, `` If we are going to win it's likely to be by one vote. That's not the kind of victory with which one can be comfortable.'' In all, the justices received a record 78 friend-of-the-court briefs _ the judicial branch's equivalent of lobbying _ from interested individuals and organizations not actually involved of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> dispute. The justices often give such unsolicited advice close attention. The same can not be said, however, for the tens of thousands of letters and hundreds of telephone calls the court is receiving daily from Americans expressing their views on abortion. `` This is not a popularity contest,'' court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON> said. `` This is a war of ideas, not numbers.'' If a war, it is one with no end in sight.

<HEAD>Congress Off to Rocky Start in Bicentennial Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The historic 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is out of sorts. The institution began its bicentennial year pledging to cooperate with a new president and touting an ambitious legislative agenda. But lawmakers have spent their first four months killing a 50-percent pay raise in embarrassment, flinging morals charges at defense secretary nominee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> and investigating the ethics of their highest-ranking official, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` This is worse than the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., likening the institution to the television tribunal `` The pay raise, <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> _ I'm baffled. What's going on? I do n't think any incumbent comes out looking very good after this sideshow.'' By the end of last week, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had met seven fewer days this year than it had by the same date in 1987, the beginning of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Sixteen laws have been enacted this year, none of them major and 10 of them commemorative measures like `` National Agriculture Day.'' Beyond the statistics, there's a widespread sense that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been sleepwalking through its legislative paces this year, distracted and preoccupied by its own internal problems. `` We're tired of a do-nothing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans last week accused majority Democrats of ignoring important legislation `` We demand that the Democrats bring these issues before the House ... so we can do the job we were elected to do.'' The implication is that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his top lieutenants are so busy playing defense against the 69 rules violations alleged against the speaker that they have lost their legislative compass. Democratic leaders, who are responsible for the Capitol's output, disagree and point to bipartisan agreements with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on the budget and aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, and to legislation on the minimum wage, savings and loans, and military base closings `` While everybody would like to see the -LRB- <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> -RRB- matter resolved as quickly as possible, the function of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is proceeding,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., the majority leader `` The speaker is moving important legislative matters. It's not true that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> is in a gridlock condition.'' Congresses are notoriously slow-starting, especially in the first session of a two-year term. And <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> leaders did bide their time for the early part of the year waiting for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration budget proposals, appointments and legislative initiatives. Even at that, the year so far has been less productive than most. While the budget agreement does add some oil to the legislative machinery, it failed to seriously address the nation's deficit problem. And the base closings action was merely a ratification of steps taken last year by an independent commission that took the political heat off <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a confluence of what would be the normal slowness, added to by some distractions,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Deering </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and close observer of the legislative process. `` That has conspired to make this, in appearance especially, a slow start. Instead of substance, they've had to focus on sidelights. The most blinding current sidelight is the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> investigation. Last week, the ethics committee formally charged the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat with 69 instances of violating House rules. Lawyers for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and the committee are fencing over arrangements for the speaker to appear and mount a personal defense before the panel, and it appears the case will drag on for at least a few more weeks. One aspect of the case, a complicated oil well transaction which yielded <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> huge profits last year, remains under investigation and could yet cause additional problems for the speaker. Waiting in the wings is a separate ethics case against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, alleging that he improperly disclosed a covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Republicans say they plan to press the matter. `` He's shark bait right now, and that's not fun,'' said <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>. `` This is a crazy process.'' On the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor and in corners all around the Capitol, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has replaced Tower and the pay raise as the prime topic of conversation. `` They're talking about it every second,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. Even Democratic senators worried about their party's image have taken a rare interest in what happens on the other side of the building. One House Democrat, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said the mood of his colleagues is at its lowest ebb in years. `` There's been a slowdown and a morale loss,'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said. `` It's a very bleak period. I've been in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seven years and I've never felt so bad and down about being a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s defenders call the charges _ that he failed to report $ 145,000 in improper gifts from a friend with a direct interest in legislation, and sought to evade limits on outside income through bulk sales of a book he wrote _ trivial and the reaction to them overblown. `` It should be beneath the dignity of this House to question that kind of thing,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` There is a certain sense of outrage that this process has taken on a life of its own that was never intended.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself has sought to maintain a normal schedule, but with varying results. Much of his days lately have been consumed by meetings with his lawyer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldaker </PERSON>, and with political allies plotting defense strategy. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s normally daily press conferences have become less frequent. At one recent one at which reporters peppered him with ethics questions, he finally asked in exasperation: `` Do you have any questions about the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?''

<HEAD>Intelligence Report Cites Continued Growth in Soviet Defense Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet defense spending rose 3 percent last year, despite President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promises to cut his military budget, according to an intelligence report released Sunday. But the study, prepared jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was laying the groundwork for his proposed 14.2 percent cut in defense spending The study said chopping military spending so sharply would require the Soviets to reduce their armed forces by more than the 500,000-troop reduction announced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December, meaning further cutbacks in the Soviet military. The newly declassified report painted a grim overall picture of the Soviet economy. It said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been forced to slow the pace of his economic reforms and to delay such key steps as allowing the market to set wholesale and retail prices. While the reforms have a good chance of success in the long run, they are likely to cause <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> short term political problems from consumers who want to see faster improvement and from bureaucrats who resent their loss of power over economic decision-making, the report said. The economy was hampered by sluggish industrial and agricultural performance, disruptions and confusion stemming from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, and the cost of coping with the earthquake that struck <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> last December, the report said `` According to our estimates, the Soviet economy grew by only about 1.5 percent in 1988 _ the second straight poor yearly showing,'' the study said. The cost of rebuilding <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> will exceed the estimated $ 11.2 billion price tag of cleaning up after the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear reactor disaster, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> predicted. All these factors contributed to a budget deficit that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> estimated at 9 percent of the Soviet Gross National Product, which is the value of all goods and services produced by an economy. Last year the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> admitted for the first time that it was running a deficit, although estimates of the amount varied among Soviet economists. Poor economic performance has forced <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to back away from some programs, and the need to provide consumer goods was impelling him to decrease defense spending, the report said. `` Soviet media indicated that the campaigns to modernize industrial plant and equipment and reform the economic system and even the once much-vaunted anti-alcohol campaign were not only failing but were occasioning major disruptions,'' it said. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> remains committed to his original vision of a revitalized economy,'' the report said. `` He has, however, apparently concluded that he can not realize this vision as rapidly as he once thought possible, nor proceed directly along the path he initially planned to follow.'' `` The shifts that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has implemented, in our view, have the potential, if sustained, to boost consumer welfare and bring a sense of order to the economy,'' the report said. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has acknowledged that consumer welfare must be substantially improved soon if the regime is to develop broad-based popular support for perestroika,'' as the reforms are called in Russian, it said. That will mean a 14.2 percent cut in defense spending, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced in January, the first time he put a firm number on cuts that had been discussed as part of a new military doctrine known as `` reasonable sufficiency.'' Despite proclamation of the new `` defensive'' military doctrine over the past two years, `` Soviet defense spending, as measured in constant 1982 rubles, grew by roughly 3 percent, in line with the growth rates of the past several years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Procurement of weapons systems was again a major contributor to growth,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Missile procurement _ particularly ICBMs -LRB- intercontinental ballistic missiles -RRB- and strategic surface-to-air missiles _ also displayed growth.'' `` Last year, however, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took several actions that evidently were intended to lay the groundwork for future military cuts,'' the report said. Key points of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan to cut military spending `` remain unclear,'' the report said, and may involve substantially larger cuts than the 500,000 troop reduction announced last December. `` Indeed, our estimates indicate that to reduce their total defense budget by 14.2 percent, the Soviets would have to go beyond the cutbacks in military programs that they have specifically promised to make.''

 The heart-wrenching news from a distant ocean, the vigil while the names of the dead trickle in, the playing of taps for the fallen _ these are not new to townspeople here, who cheer for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s victories and cry for its defeats. None of the 47 sailors killed in a gun turret explosion Wednesday on the battleship USS Iowa listed the area as their hometown. Yet the people here are claiming them as their own _ just as they have done so many times before when death strikes a Norfolk-based ship. `` There is n't an ` us' or ` them.' Even when the tragedy strikes far away from here, it is felt here. That ship is part of our community,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Leafe </PERSON>. Overnight, the <LOCATION> Norfolk-Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News-Hampton </LOCATION> metropolitan area of 1.3 million became a small town. In schools, shops, bars and on the streets, the topic of conversation was the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> _ who was aboard, who had word, who was helping, who had lost someone. `` It's hard to find anybody in any walk of life in this area that did n't start out in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a sociologist at <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` With this area's long history as the world's largest naval facility, the impact goes deeper. Young people get out of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, they seem to stay around here.'' The military's influence is seen throughout <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roads </LOCATION>, as the area where the <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> rivers meet the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is known. `` The economic relationship between the military and civilian sectors is a very close one,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindur </PERSON>, director of research for <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The military is the major employer. That isolates us from any downward trends in the economy.'' The area has 138,000 active military men and women and 65,000 military retirees, according to government statistics. The annual payroll and federal spending for the area is $ 5.53 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION>, which is building nuclear aircraft carriers, is the state's biggest private employer. By comparison, tourism, the area's other major industry, brings in about $ 1.3 billion. While the civilian-military economic marriage seems a sweet one, socially there has always been some friction. There are tales of `` sailors and dogs keep off the grass'' signs appearing during World War II. Local officials say the signs never existed, or if they did, they were someone's poor idea of a joke. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men, however, have been denied service in bars or made to pay exorbitant cover charges. In every case, when the practice became known, it ceased. `` It's a love-hate relationship, especially with the younger military men. There are a lot of kids in town and they do what all kids do ... and sometimes they get into trouble,'' said <PERSON> Pindur </PERSON>. `` It's a pain sometimes to have all these kids running loose, but, at the same time, there is an appreciation for what they do. There job is to protect us.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said some of the friction is based on class differences. `` Let's face it, the majority of these <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> kids are from lower-or working-class families,'' he said. `` For them, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was a way out.'' But the tension disappears in times of triumph or tragedy. `` We are a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> community,'' <PERSON> Pindur </PERSON> said. `` There is a deep empathy for things that happen to <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> folks.'' The Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lassalle </PERSON>, who delivered a short homily Friday at a service organized by the city in tribute to the dead, gestured toward the workmen setting up the podium on the <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> waterfront, the police honor guard officers rehearsing their entrance and the people quietly gathering. `` Words do n't always say enough, but the actions of today ... perhaps they say even if we did n't know their faces or their names, those men were ours,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s march to City Hall by defeating two blacks has left the black vote in disarray and has many wondering whether <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s inauguration Monday will be his first and only or the first of many. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the last of the big-city bosses, ended blacks' six-year grip on the mayoralty by soundly beating acting Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in February's Democratic primary and by doing the same to <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> six weeks later <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> will complete the last two years of the second term of the city's first black mayor, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who died in 1987. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, won six consecutive terms. Whether the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> is in for the long term may depend less on his own actions than on whether black voters can regroup after splintering between <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` We knew what the stakes were this time around and we let it get away from us once. ...

Most election post-mortems have centered on the low black turnout that crippled both <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, despite the efforts of former Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on behalf of both. The ensuing debate among blacks has centered on whether they should spend their time on the sidelines developing a black independent party, as <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> suggests, or try to rebuild the multiracial coalition that lifted <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to power in 1983 and made him the first mayor since the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to be re-elected. `` The reason <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> won _ and make no mistake about it _ is because he was able to graft liberal whites and Hispanics onto that huge bloc,'' said <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON>, a black who is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s editorial board. `` It does n't have to be tomorrow, but blacks should begin the process of looking for a candidate to do that. ... To suggest they sit on the sidelines and wait until the numbers grow enough to go it alone ... is just short-sighted.'' The city has roughly equal numbers of blacks and whites, but whites make up about 49 percent of the electorate, compared with about 43 percent for blacks. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a veteran political strategist who held top posts in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> campaigns, said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> won `` because a lot of white liberals and people who joined <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s reform movement were willing to give him a chance and because a lot of blacks did n't feel a sufficient amount of outrage and did n't vote.'' `` What <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has to do now is make good on his campaign promises to be inclusive, racially and ethnically, in terms of appointments and contracts and promote reform-minded legislation,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` If he does n't, the movement had better be ready.''

<TEXT>
 Two military space shuttle flights planned next summer will be delayed, one for at least three months, because work on the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> is taking longer than expected. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the schedule had become too tight to support both missions and still preserve an October launch for the high-priority <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> flight to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. A Discovery launch that had been scheduled for Aug. 10 will be delayed until at least November. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, which had a July 1 launch target, will be launched in early August, the space agency said. Both missions are to deploy classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payloads. Unaffected will be Friday's planned liftoff of Atlantis with the Magellan-Venus spacecraft on board, the first planet-bound payload scheduled for release from a space shuttle. The schedule changes will have a ripple effect on launch dates later in the year, leaving <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> with six instead of its goal of seven shuttle launches this year. Officials have said the planned Oct. 12 liftoff of Atlantis with the Jupiter-orbiting <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft is a high-priority flight because there is only a 40-day launch period during which Jupiter and Earth are aligned properly. So it will be next in line after <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s August mission. Then will come the delayed Discovery military flight, probably in November, and a flight, probably in December, in which <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s crew is to deploy a communications satellite and retrieve a science satellite which has been orbiting since 1984. The mission of Discovery with the <ORGANIZATION> Hubble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telescope </ORGANIZATION>, long awaited by astronomers, will slip from its present December launch slot into 1990. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said dates for missions after the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> flight will be determined later. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> management has become increasingly concerned that the work involved in preparing the orbiter <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> for its first flight in over three years is taking long enough that it might endanger the option to launch <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> at the opening of the launch window,'' said shuttle chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>. `` Our overriding objectives in this situation are to protect the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> window and to fly <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> as early as we can.'' Following the Challenger explosion in January 1986, the shuttle fleet was grounded for 32 months while the three remaining orbiters underwent major modifications to improve safety and performance. The modified Discovery has made two flights since the accident and <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> is about to make its second. Besides the Challenger-dictated changes, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, the first shuttle and a veteran of seven space trips, also had to undergo extensive alterations to its thermal protection tile system and is the last one to be returned to flight status. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> work is taking longer than planned because of a shortage of skilled engineers and technicians to process three shuttles simultaneously.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The day <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war began its 15th year, 69 people were killed or wounded. Most were civilians. The casualties were caused by an estimated 25,000 shells and rockets fired by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem forces that day, April 13. The figures indicate it took 362 shells and rockets to inflict one casualty. That's about average in the daily battles between mainly Christian units of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s army, long fractured along sectarian lines, and an alliance of Syrian forces and Moslem Druse militiamen. It costs the <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> about $ 120,000 every time it fires a broadside from one of its 40-barrel 240mm rocket launchers into Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It costs Gen. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army units about the same to lob a similar number of 155mm howitzer shells into Moslem zones. But there is no shortage of guns or ammunition among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s warring factions, who are well supplied by regional powers who use <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to fight their rivals by proxy Leftist and Moslem militias are armed and bankrolled by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Their Christian rivals get their U.S.-made weapons from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It's a strange war. There are no ground assaults. No one gains territory or loses it. Both sides, deeply entrenched, just hammer each other, usually with long-range weapons. The current round of fighting, the worst in four years, started March 8. Since then, by police count, more than 270 people have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded. Despite the intensity of the shelling, with 50 shells and rockets a minute falling in the worst barrages, the casualty toll is surprisingly low. The reason is that after 14 years of civil war and factional bloodletting, the Lebanese have developed a sixth sense about when trouble is near. They know to head for underground bunkers and basements. For those who have n't developed that sense, the signal to take cover is the theme song from the movie `` Shaft'' on the radio. The <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> tune always precedes flashes on where shells are falling. Beirutis know that when their side starts firing, a retaliatory barrage is inevitable. When the big fuel depot on the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> side was hit a few days ago, sending up a huge fireball and destroying virtually all <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fuel supplies, the radio advised everyone living near the blazing facility to get away in case other fuel tanks blew. A distraught Christian mother of three told how she rushed out of her apartment with her family amid the thud of exploding shells nearby. It was only when she reached her brother's house in the neighboring <LOCATION> Hazmieh </LOCATION> district that she realized she'd left her son with a neighbor. Three hours later, the 10-year-old boy showed up. He had walked three miles under heavy shelling without a scratch. `` Those were the worst hours of my life,'' said the young woman. She did not want to be identified, `` because my husband works abroad and I do n't want him to hear about this.'' But despite their well-honed survival instincts, people are sometimes caught off guard. A young Moslem named <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> was killed by shrapnel as he drove his family from his home in the south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to be with his elderly mother during a lull a few days ago, his neighbors said. A 25-year-old Druse student, just back from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> where he majored in computer science, was killed when he visited a militia base manned by fighters of <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` We'd asked him to teach us how to use communications equipment,'' a fighter said. `` A shell landed close to where we were standing and he was killed.'' The bunkers have become second homes for many families. For many Beirutis, life underground is austere and cramped. Power plants have been hit or shut down because fuel has run out. Fires rage out of control because the water pumping system does n't work, because there's no power. Several families are often crammed into reinforced basements for days on end, eating from stockpiles of canned food and water, sleeping as best they can by the light of kerosene lamps or candles. For the well-off, bunker life can be almost comfortable. Fourteen Christian families living in the <LOCATION> Adonis </LOCATION> district of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> have constructed a luxury two-story bunker under their apartment block. One of them, furniture store owner <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Breidi </PERSON>, has fitted it with wall-to-wall carpets, 10 double beds, armchairs, refrigerators and a small gambling salon. They also have two color television sets with video recorders, and radio telephones, which operate independently of their generator. There are video games for the children. The fridge is stocked with smoked salmon, hams, imported cheeses, steaks and wine. The families' maids, mostly Sri Lankans and Filipinas, live on the first floor below ground level.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may be asked to bail out numerous corporations that will be forced into bankruptcy in the next recession because of excessive debt, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said a study that shows a spectacular increase in the amount of high-risk `` junk bond'' debt since 1980 makes him worry about the possibility of a taxpayer bailout similar to the multibillion dollar rescue of the nation's troubled savings and loans. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> study `` tells us that the amount of corporate debt is going through the roof and that the quality of corporate debt is going through the floor.'' In 1980, one out of 25 bonds was below investment grade; today it is one out of five, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Corporate debt has tripled since 1980. `` When we see another recession _ and ultimately we will _ you're going to see that recession deeper and longer because of this great increase in debt and some of these highly leveraged corporations,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` And then you'll see so many of them going bankrupt that you'll begin to hear cries for having the taxpayers going in and bailing them out like we had to do on the savings and loan industry and that gives me very deep concern,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said The study said more than $ 30 billion in junk bonds was issued in the last three years, accounting for more than 20 percent of outstanding corporate debt. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said his committee would be examining a way of limiting the attractiveness of corporate debt.

 Communist rebels claimed responsibility Saturday for killing a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> colonel who advised this country's military, and officials fearing more attacks bolstered security for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. Philippine troops near the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in the country were reinforced and put on maximum alert immediately after Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> was slain Friday, according to Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> army's chief of staff. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s Filipino driver was wounded Communist assassins in a stolen car sprayed <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s vehicle with bullets while he was on his way to work in suburban <LOCATION> Quezon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The killers escaped. The 51-year-old <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, who was a prisoner of war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, served as chief of the ground forces division of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which provides training and logistical support to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was a decorated Vietnam War veteran who was held in a cage for five years by the <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> until he escaped in 1968. He wrote a book about the ordeal titled, `` Five Years to Freedom.'' The communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for his assassination in a statement delivered Saturday to news agencies. The statement threatened further attacks if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to back President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s fight against the 20-year Communist insurgency. `` The death of Col. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> signifies the firm commitment of the revolutionary forces to continue military actions against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel and installations, as these are manifestations of the arrogant trampling of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists on the Filipino people's independence and sovereignty,'' the statement said The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ordered additional security for the 1,000 sailors on the flagship USS Blue Ridge of the 7th Fleet. The ship arrived Friday for a four-day <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> port call. Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, the fleet's spokesman, said the sailors were told to travel in groups and avoid dark alleys. Filipino soldiers used bomb-sniffing dogs Saturday to check luggage at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport, fearing terrorists might try to plant bombs on departing planes. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> called the killing a `` cowardly'' act, and presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities would help the government search for the killers. No date had been set for memorial services or for flying <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s body back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> His killing came five days after the rebels announced they were `` determined to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialism pay dearly for the continuing stay of its bases and its escalating intervention in our people's affairs. That statement was issued to claim reponsibility for the bombing of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications station in the northern province of Benguet on April 9. No one was hurt. In October 1987, rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino outside <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Authorities later increased security at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases and civilian offices in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said additional precautions were now needed because <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s killing created `` a new problem for us, because this was terrorism against foreign nationals.'' The six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> installations, which include <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval station, are occupied by about 40,000 soldiers, civilian workers, and dependents. About 100,000 other Americans live in the country. Resentment toward <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces has spread beyond the rebel army in recent years. The agreement allowing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases to remain was extended last year to 1991 over heavy opposition from protesters and some lawmakers.

 Olympic Airways' flight and ground attendants defied a court order and grounded the national carrier Saturday with a 24-hour strike. A spokesman for the airline said all flights were canceled and that normal schedules would be resumed Sunday. Olympic's pilots and flight engineers did not join the walkout but were unable to fly without attendants, said the spokesman, who requested anonymity. The attendants are seeking overtime and additional pay for night flights. The strikers ignored a court order obtained by the airline Friday that forbade the walkout and threatened to fine and possibly jail participants. If the strikers' demands are not met, the airline spokesman said, the union has threatened to start a five-day walkout Monday. This week is Easter holy week for Greek Orthodox Christians, who celebrate Easter Sunday on April 30, and many if not all the airline's flights have long been sold out.

<TEXT>
 For those to whom a heavy diet of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s `` Ring Cycle'' is poison, the Metropolitan Opera has an antidote that's easy to swallow _ an `` Elixir of Love'' with superstars <PERSON> Luciano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Battle </PERSON> <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON>'s comic masterpiece _ which he dashed off in an amazing two weeks _ made its first appearance of the season Friday night to a standing-room-only crowd. It will be performed four more times during the final two weeks of the season, while most of the Met's attention is devoted to its new staging of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s four-part `` Der Ring Des Nibelungen.'' Luckily, this fading but still charming 1960 production by <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hearn </PERSON> practically runs by itself, like a windup clock. And with music so effervescent and a plot so foolproof, the audience is guaranteed a good time, even if the performance never quite sparkles as it should. <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> started his career singing light tenor roles like <PERSON> Nemorino </PERSON>, the bumbling country bumpkin who tries to win the heart of his true love by drinking a magic potion. He's gone on to tackle heavier parts _ and lost some of his luster in the process _ but this role remains a favorite. Though he's always an agreeable performer, <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> was not in top vocal form Friday night, straining for notes when he should have been caressing them. His big second-act aria, `` Una furtiva lagrima,'' drew the usual feverish ovation from his fans, but in truth it was only moderately soothing to the ear. Miss Battle, as the heroine <PERSON> Adina </PERSON>, took a while to warm up, at first sounding oddly detached as she has in other recent assignments at the Met. But after the intermission, she became more animated and produced a rich, full tone along with her famous silvery high notes. It was good to hear Doctor <PERSON> Dulcamara </PERSON>, the traveling quack who arrives in a balloon, sung with the firm, booming voice that bass <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Plishka </PERSON> displayed. Often the part is given to an aging singer who must rely on comic business to cover up an inability to get all the notes across. Less effective was <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> as Sergeant <PERSON> Belcore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nemorino </PERSON>'s rival for the love of <PERSON> Adina </PERSON> His modest baritone just could n't hold its own in such high-powered vocal company. <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Panni </PERSON>, who conducted <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON> and Miss Battle in the same opera in Central Park last summer, was making his house debut and did n't quite have his act together. The orchestra sounded ragged at times, and the singers, especially <PERSON> Pavarotti </PERSON>, tended to go their own way where tempos were concerned.

 Dozens of military aircraft will be diverted to civilian duty to haul 50,000 tons of farm produce, construction equipment, and other goods around the country this year, an official report said. The report Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency gave no reason for the move. However, it said the military planes would be transporting southern fruit and vegetables to northern cities, including <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. Those cities suffer chronic shortages of such goods. Military aircraft have occasionally been used for civilian duty in the past. They helped deliver equipment and relief workers after the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident and the Armenian earthquake in December, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. A new resolution ordering the aircraft to carry civilian cargoes was adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the news agency said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the 60 military transport planes in the program will include the <PERSON> Ruslan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Antheus </LOCATION> jumbo jets, Il-76 turbojets and An-12 turboprops. It did not say when the program would begin or how long it would last.

Col.

 The middle-aged white woman in the <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> sweatshirt was pleasantly enthusiastic. `` He's for fair play for all,'' she said of the <PERSON> ex-Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> leader she had come to hear. `` Right now it's like we've become the minority and we need someone to do something.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, who has made the jump from radical fringe to elected official, points to such people as proof his message is becoming mainstream. Now leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> won a seat in the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> by talking about the high birthrate among unwed welfare women and claiming that whites are victimized by civil rights laws. `` I think I spoke out loud what a lot of people say around the dinner table,'' he said. `` People were so impressed by the ideas that they voted for me despite the controversy of my background.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is not alone in his thinking. Much of what he says is echoed by those who have opposed him throughout his career. `` The <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> election was a signal of a sour mood of resentment on the part of some whites that has been a long time in developing,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Suall </PERSON>, director of fact-finding for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. `` There is a perception out there that blacks are being favored at the expense of whites, not merely in employment but in status in the media.'' Some dismiss <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s slim, 200-vote victory as an anomaly; his suburban <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> district is 99 percent white. But <PERSON> Suall </PERSON> and other trackers of racial tension believe disparate events, like <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s election and the rise of the racist skinhead subculture, are warning signs to be taken seriously. `` These people and these events represent something larger,'' said <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlet </PERSON>, a researcher for <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` They are like the canaries in mines telling us there is an undercurrent of people that are very unhappy.'' This unhappiness, says <PERSON> Berlet </PERSON> and others, runs long and deep. It is the result of economic changes that have nibbled away at the blue-collar union tradition; of fear of drugs and crime; of the perception that civil rights programs like affirmative action are unfair to whites, and of a general hopelessness within the white working class that sees a shrinking of its power in society. At a shopping mall on the edge of <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>'s district, a white woman in her 30s offered her opinion but declined to give her name: `` You see all this about black power and black pride and helping blacks economically and I guess that started out with good intentions. But it's not right when whites lose jobs and it's not fair when you're called a racist for complaining about it.'' It is difficult to measure this mood. Most polls show the American public far more tolerant of racial differences and integration programs than it once was. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON>, a pollster who has worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said standard surveys that ask yes-no questions ca n't plumb the depth of individual attitudes <PERSON> McKeon </PERSON> said his phone surveys, which involve more dialogue with subjects, show `` big time disenchantment.'' `` It's nothing you can put a number on, but there is a resentment out there that the lower middle class, and their children, are n't going to be any better off than they were,'' he said. `` If you ask, ` Are you mad because your kid did n't get a scholarship and a black kid did?' they're going to say no. But if you talk to them you're going to see this resentment woven into the fabric of their thoughts.'' Those in the civil rights trenches, like <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>, an organizer for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Human Relations, note a simmering anger, especially among young whites. `` A growing number of white people in their 20s feel they are on the short end of the stick,'' said <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>, who tries to defuse racial tension in the blue-collar neighborhoods on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> side, an area that has seen Klan rallies and violence by skinheads <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said the lower middle-class white bastion of the secure union job is crumbling. At the same time, the disenchanted see a growing black middle class moving in and believe it is the result of favored government treatment. `` A black on his way up might have a chance to buy a home in a neighborhood where a young white kid just saw his job leave,'' he said. `` The anger is being placed now on black folks and affirmative action.'' Beyond the economics is an issue of group identity and pride. The higher profile of minorities on stage, film and the television screen gives some whites, already worried about their status, the sense that their importance in society is diminishing. <PERSON> Berlet </PERSON> noted that while relatively few blacks appear on TV, their numbers have increased so rapidly that their representation can seem disproportional. `` Blacks make up 15 percent of the population and maybe only 4 percent on TV,'' he said. `` But when some whites see ... more black faces on televison, they think they're taking over.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, a 20-year-old <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> skinhead who declined to give his last name, complained bitterly about what he sees as `` black propaganda.'' `` I was watching television and they had these blacks sitting around, telling everybody it was blacks who invented this and blacks who invented that. It was abunch of lies,'' he said. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON>, a fellow skinhead, sees such concepts as black pride and black history coming at the expense of white identity. `` White heritage is not being taught in school. It's like you're supposed to be ashamed of being white while they're teaching black heritage full force,'' he said `` They completely downplay the role whites have in this country.'' These frustrations can blossom into acts of racial violence that <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> has seen in his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> neighborhoods. `` Or,'' he said, `` these people can vote for a <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> in the belief they can protect what is mine.'' Whether or not that translates into the election of more candidates with similar ideologies is debated by the pulsetakers of society. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipset </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist, thinks other white rights candidates may be elected to local office, `` but they're dead if they have any ambitions to go further.'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, however, believes he is only the first to tap into a sentiment that will grow. `` I think that this is the beginning of a time when we will see candidates discuss these things,'' he said. `` A candidate who does n't have to carry the political baggage I had to carry and who discusses these issues will win.''

 Syrian forces fired rockets at the port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> Saturday as thousands of fleeing Christians waited for ships to carry them to safety, police said. No casualties were reported as the 122mm Soviet-designed Grad rockets exploded around <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, the Christians' only escape route from their beleaguered enclave. Other rockets hit the area around the coastal highway running north to the ancient port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sources reported that one unidentified ship slipped into the port. Several other small freighters with unknown cargoes have reached the Christian zone in recent days. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival, has been supplying weapons and ammunition to the Christians. Saturday's salvos came during a relative lull in the battles between the Syrians, aided by Moslem Druse allies, and the mainly Christian units of army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. By police count, 270 people have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded in ferocious artillery and rocket exchanges that began March 8. Police reported that an estimated 4,000 Christians had gathered at <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, awaiting a ferry from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> to take them to safety. The 4,000-ton <PERSON> Baroness </PERSON> <PERSON> M </PERSON>, one of two ferries that have carried 12,000 Christians to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> during the fighting, anchored off <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> on Friday night. The ship took on an estimated 1,200 people who were shuttled out from <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> in small boats without incident. Cypriot shipping officials said the Baroness M would make the trip to <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> again Sunday. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem Voice of the Nation termed the Syrian rocketing a `` warning to ships to stay away from the besieged enclave.'' `` It will persist as long as the blockade imposed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> perists,'' it said. The current spasm of fighting was triggered after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, seeking to restore state authority to the fractured government, blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias. The 310-square-mile Christian enclave is ringed on its three landward sides by hostile forces, and about 1 million Christians are trapped inside. Despite the shelling of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, no major exchanges between the Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> regions have been reported for three days. But few believed the lull would last. The Ad-Diyar daily quoted Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal militia, as warning: `` The lull will not last ... as long as we do n't have a political settlement.'' The television station run by the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the Christians' main militia, advised Christians trapped in the enclave how to aid casualties in the event of new shelling. `` Keep your nerves under control,'' it said. `` Parks cars in such a way that they do n't block ambulances. Take cover in the nearest bomb shelter, underground bunker or building entrance.''

 A Soviet deputy foreign minister arrived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday for talks aimed at overcoming problems facing the first Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years, sources said. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is scheduled to come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on May 15. The two sides have had difficulty agreeing on a joint communique to be issued at the visit's end, said an Eastern European source, speaking on condition of anonymity. It is hoped the visit by Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will clear up these difficulties, specifically the Soviet and Chinese position on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Other difficulties concern the vision that each nation has of future Sino-Soviet ties. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has played down the significance of its growing ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, while the Soviets like to portray their improving rapport with the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> as a foreign relations coup. One indication of this occurred when the date of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit was announced in February Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> ended a visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Feb. 3 by announcing the date. At a press conference that same day, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official denied a date had been set. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> then waited two days to announce that the date was May 15. <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> arrived Saturday afternoon, a Chinese source said. His visit had been planned for some time but postponed for unknown reasons. Both <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> support a Vietnamese troop pullout from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by September. They also support an end to Chinese aid for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s anti-Vietnamese guerrillas. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 to replace the pro-Chinese <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> with a pro-Vietnamese puppet government. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> apparently still differ on the composition of a transitional government, which would rule until elections to replace the current Vietnamese-installed government. The last Soviet leader to visit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> in 1959.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is playing a real-life game of Monopoly with <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> real estate these days. In less than a month, the developer has announced two property deals that would put him in command of a lucrative five-block area in the center of the <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> regulatory authorities say they will look closely at the implications of the deal in deciding whether to approve it. The financial genius of the deal is that the two acquisitions would be taken off the rolls as casinos and converted into luxury hotels to comply with state law, thus enhancing the market share for the gambling spots <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> law has a three-casino limit per owner. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns Trump Plaza, <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> and the soon-to-be-opened Taj Mahal. Converting <PERSON> Elsinore </PERSON>'s Atlantis Casino Hotel and the former Penthouse casino site into hotels would benefit the gaming hall in the middle, Trump Plaza, said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` When you take a casino site off the market, the people sharing the pie will share bigger pieces,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> took the most important five blocks in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ where Caesars begins and Atlantis ends. Four properties were going to share that space and now there's only going to be two.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s Atlantis purchase is subject to regulatory approval. The financially ailing casino is controlled by a state-appointed conservator. `` There's a good deal of concern over anyone who amasses too much of the real estate among the casino-zoned properties,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON>, director of the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. `` The public policy of this state is to foster competition in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> marketplace, and the public policy is against undue economic concentration. `` The question it boils down to is with all the incremental holdings of Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> _ or anyone, for that matter _ when is enough enough?'' <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said. `` That's a very difficult issue to assess because the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> did n't give a precise formula other than the three-license rule.'' At the same time, regulators must consider the prerogative of an entrepreneur to enter into such agreements, as well as the best use for the property and what the local market is able to handle, he said. The Casino Control Act, <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said, `` wants a healthy mix of competitors _ diversified and multi-dimensional.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Danzinger </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said the issue is whether <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has become powerful enough `` to become a government of his own.'' `` Among casino employees, he will control 20 percent of the industry,'' <PERSON> Danziger </PERSON> said. `` If for some reason the state had to close him up, what impact would that have on the industry? And how much impact would it have if he decides to walk away from the gaming tables? The state should be debating those questions _ and they probably are.'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s purchase of the Atlantis for `` a bargain price'' of $ 63 million; <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought the former Penthouse site for $ 56 million. If both deals are completed, `` Trump will control almost a mile of Boardwalk frontage,'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said. `` That's very powerful.''

<TEXT>
 A former government leader who died of poisoning after resigning in the midst of a corruption scandal will be buried at a national shrine for revolutionary heroes, officials said Saturday. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON>, who was the government's senior minister for political affairs, will be entombed Sunday at Heroes' Acre on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said. <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON>, 64, died at <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>'s main hospital on Thursday from poisoning. No details were available, but police sources said they were investigating whether he committed suicide. He was a founder of the party of socialist President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, which controls the government as the country's only legal party. Nyagumbo ranked third in its hierarchy. <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON>, the longest serving political detainee in the former colony of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION>, spent 21 years in jail for opposition to white rule. After <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> became the independent nation of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> in 1980, <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON> held key posts in the Cabinet, the 15-member Politburo and the ruling party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But he resigned his government and party posts April 14 after he was found by a presidential inquiry to be involved in a racket involving illegal sales of vehicles. Investigators found he abused his position by acquiring 38 vehicles, mostly for friends, from a state assembly plant. <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON> denied wrongdoing but stepped down. Despite the scandal, the government spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> declared Nyagumbo a national hero. `` His death has robbed us of a man whose record of revolutionary performance is second to none,'' the president said Friday. <PERSON> Nyagumbo </PERSON>'s body was to lie in state until burial. The revolutionary shrine honors about 27,000 Zimbabweans who died in the seven-year guerrilla war that led to independence.

<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, for more than a century one of the toughest places in the nation to do time, has been emptied of virtually all its most hardened criminals. Some 1,750 of them, more than half the population of the 137-year-old fortress that once held <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, have been sent to new prisons throughout <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as part of a $ 5 billion prison expansion. In their place are minimum - and medium-security prisoners, including many who live in trailers outside the prison walls on <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>'s fenced-in grounds and have little contact with the higher-risk inmates inside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Death Row remains here for the 252 prisoners, all men, facing execution by cyanide gas. But aside from them, `` we have lost almost all of our hard-core -LRB- inmates -RRB-,'' said prison spokesman <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, not unhappily. `` That once housed the most desperate people in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' he said, pointing to an empty five-tier cellblock. `` Now, it's just a temporary holding facility.'' The concrete-and-steel compound ringed by guard towers on the edge of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> has long been depicted as one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s toughest prisons. Its inmates included <PERSON> Sirhan </PERSON>, who assassinated <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1968, and <PERSON> Caryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Chessman </PERSON>, convicted of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' `` red light bandit'' sex attacks of 1948. He became a best-selling author behind bars before being executed in 1960. But in the past two years, most of the highest-risk prisoners have been sent to three new prisons. <PERSON> Manson </PERSON>, the leader of a murderous cult and perhaps the most notorious prisoner in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, went to the new Corcoran prison near <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> is one of eight prisons opened in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since 1980. The state's prison population has tripled since then to more than 75,000, more than any other state. None of the older prisons has been affected more than <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>. On the outside, the complex appears as forbidding as ever. Several buildings were erected in the middle to late 19th century _ one has the date 1857 chiseled in its front _ and even the more recent structures are decades old. On the inside, what authorities call <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>'s `` change in mission'' is quickly apparent. In addition to holding medium - and minimum-security inmates, it serves as a reception center, where new inmates are sent for orientation and classification `` The stress level here has dropped considerably over the past couple of years,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` We used to have some kind of incident every day. It was n't uncommon to have a ` lockup' every month. Now that's pretty much of a rarity.'' The prison has been extensively remodeled, including a $ 28 million overhaul of an old cellblock. In the hospital, 55 years old but newly refurbished, is the dental ward, a spic-and-span suite that smells powerfully of disinfectant. `` They call me ` Dr. Painless,''' said Dr. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>, a bouyant, breezy man who has taken care of prisoners' teeth here for 22 years. He calls the ward `` the only air-conditioned place in the prison ... as good as any on the outside.'' Despite the changes, a visitor never forgets that <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> is steeped in violence. Before visitors go through the massive steel gates, a guard warns of the possibility of being taken hostage and adds that state policy `` is to never negotiate a prisoner's freedom for the release of hostages.'' The officer adds with a grin, `` Welcome to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION>!''

The 15-year-old was waiting April 16 at a Greyhound terminal for a bus to her <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION> home when she was taken to a house in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and attacked, said Sgt. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojarro </PERSON>. The girl told police she escaped Friday night and asked two men in a car to take her to police. Instead, she was driven to a park in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and raped, said <PERSON> Mojarro </PERSON>. She was found in the park early Saturday. One of the men in the car was arrested, the sergeant said.

 Demonstrators dressed as aerosal cans and refrigerators raced up a church stairway Saturday and burst through a paper-covered hoop, symbolically depicting the depletion of the Earth's ozone layer. A crowd of about 1,000 people watched as about 20 costumed activists staged the protest to mark `` Earth Day,'' a day of environmental awareness called by ecological groups worldwide. The demonstration was held at the Spanish Steps, a 137-step staircase to the Trinita Dei Monti church. Organizers said the demonstration re-enacted the effects on the ozone layer of chlorofluorocarbons, compounds used in aerosol spray cans and refrigerators. The ozone layer protects Earth from cancer-causing untraviolet light. <PERSON> Beniamino </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonardi </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said the demonstration sought to publicize efforts to make the government ban the use of chlorofluorocarbons.

<HEAD>FEC Documents: Gramm Fought Agency Over Campaign Violations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> employed unusual tactics, including a lawsuit, to fight attempts by federal auditors to review his 1984 campaign's financial records, government documents show. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, who agreed to end the 5-year dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> by paying a $ 30,000 fine, gave his version of the events last month in a move that preempted public release of documents in the case. The Texan Republican released the settlement to news organizations on a Friday night, after the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> had closed and before the settlement was final. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> had made the `` final offer and it was ours to accept or reject. That was the final action as far as we were concerned.'' While acknowledging errors and blaming them on the inexperience of volunteers, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> described them as technical reporting violations. Although many of the instances did involve reporting errors, an <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> audit also found that the campaign apparently accepted 151 separate contributions from corporations totaling $ 10,890. Corporate contributions to political campaigns are forbidden under both <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and federal laws. <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> documents in the case also reveal the Friends of <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> committee fought the agency's investigation of federal campaign violations with tactics that included a lawsuit against the commission in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and its members as individuals. The committee also questioned subpoenas issued by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> to obtain key papers. In one instance, the campaign committee insisted on a piece-by-piece inventory of more than 500,000 committee documents sought by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>. `` This procedure would have been more expensive and time-consuming than the audit itself,'' according to a report by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said disputes early in the auditing process were largely due to `` a bureaucratic procedure that the general counsel's office attempted to impose.'' He said the agency at one point sent a letter that simply said: `` ` Please send half a million documents to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> immediately. Thank you.' Obviously, we felt inventories were appropriate and necessary and challenged them on points such as that. `` In essence, we felt that some of the bureaucrats the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> dispatched to handle this audit were high-handed and lowdown,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON> said it is not often the agency must go to court in the course of an investigation, `` and it is even less often that the commission is sued, and especially if the commissioners are sued in their individual capacity.'' <PERSON> Moxley </PERSON> said an average <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation lasts eight months, although some cases have taken longer. `` So something that draws on for four years is unusual.'' He described the fine as one of the largest ever in a congressional race. Yet in a statement accompanying the release of the settlement, campaign treasurer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said: `` The campaign has made a consistent and very costly effort over five years to comply fully with the spirit and substance of the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s regulations.'' White said the crush of 70,000 individual contributions totaling $ 10 million `` defeated the efforts of our volunteer campaign workers to adequately screen and process the incoming mail.'' The corporate contributions in question slipped through the `` normal screening process undetected because checks drawn on corporate bank accounts were not readily identifiable as such,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. Of the 151 prohibited contributions, 127 appear not to have been refunded within 30 days, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> counsel's report said. Auditors said they found one instance in which the campaign committee `` made a refund of an apparent corporate contribution, and voided this refund check when the contributor stated he had intended to write the check from a personal account rather than a corporate account.''

<HEAD>Official: Elimination Of Nuclear Rockets In Germany Should Not Be
Excluded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A high-ranking government official said Saturday <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should not exclude the possibility of eliminating short-range nuclear rockets now based on German soil. The remark by Education Minister <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON> could further fuel a simmering disagreement between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over short-range nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is expected to press the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to early superpower talks on reducing those weapons. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are strongly opposed to early talks, contending that <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact superiority in conventional weapons requires a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> nuclear deterrent of short-range arsenals. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also wants the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to postpone a decision on modernizing those weapons until 1991 or 1992. Speaking at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON> reiterated the West German government's position but went even farther, saying <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact should not exclude the possibility of eliminating short-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON> is a leading member of the Free Democrats, junior partners in <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s coalition government. `` Depending on -LRB- disarmament -RRB- negotiations results and other concrete realities, it should be decided after 1992 whether we need any nuclear, land-based short-range rockets,'' <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moellemann </PERSON> also called on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to make its own `` wide-ranging'' disarmament initiatives and not to react only when the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc makes disarmament proposals. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> are scheduled to fly to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials.

<HEAD>Jurors Recess For Weekend Without Reaching Verdict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury weighed the guilt or innocence of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> for part of a second day Saturday, then took the rest of the weekend off as the former presidential aide awaited his fate on 12 felony counts stemming from his role in the Iran-Contra affair. The nine women and three men, guided in their deliberations by a 95-page set of instructions from District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, arrived bright and early Saturday to resume work in an 18-by-12 room on the sealed second floor of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse. But there were no clues as to their progress by the time they quit at 12:10 p.m. to return to their downtown hotel to relax, under constant supervision of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, until resuming work Monday. The jurors, who were asked by the judge to begin by 9:30 each morning, were driven in a van to the courthouse at 8:20 a.m. and started their work at 8:45. The jury had deliberated for six hours on Friday. So far, only requests for copies of <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s instructions _ one for each juror _ and for pencils, paper, and paper clips have emanated from the jury room, along with the question Friday, `` Is lunch at 12?'' They got the materials, and the early lunch. Writing supplies remained a concern Saturday. An unsigned note which covered the jury's return of some documents to the court for safekeeping had this `` P.S.: Please sharpen pencils. And we need more pencils, and highlighters.'' The jurors will be allowed family visits, under marshals' supervision, at their hotel on Sunday The jurors are forbidden to talk about the case, even among themselves, when they are not in the jury room. North's trial, nearly three months long, is the first stemming from the late 1985-early 1986 sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ at a 270 percent markup in price _ and the siphoning off of some of the proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. Three other men, former National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, and former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> are awaiting separate trials. Another former national security adviser, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, has pleaded guilty and received two years' probation and a $ 20,000 fine for withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the episode. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel who served as deputy to both <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, is charged with 12 felony counts, including withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, lying to Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> about his activities, destroying and altering documents, misusing money entrusted to him and accepting an illegal gratuity _ a $ 13,800 security system at his home. North, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, testified he was a mere `` pawn in a chess game played by giants'' and was following orders throughout, even as he was the action officer in both major elements of the Iran-Contra scheme. `` I was not stepping in,'' he said. `` I was brought in ... basically it was a handoff _ ` you've got the ball, now run with it.' But independent prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> told the jury `` You have heard a lot about courage at this trial. There's another kind of courage: courage, to admit when you are wrong; courage to admit personal responsibility, courage to admit guilt where appropriate. He has not admitted any of those things; it's time for you do to it for him.'' In his instructions, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> set specific guidelines for the jury's consideration of each specific count. For example, on the count that <PERSON> North </PERSON> obstructed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by making false or misleading statements to two House committees, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said, `` A false or misleading answer to a question may be taken by you as an obstruction if it was made corruptly, with the specific intent to impede the investigation ... it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted for the specific purposes of obstructing or impeding.'' Similarly, on four counts that <PERSON> North </PERSON> made false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the jury could convict only if it is convinced that `` when the defendant made or caused to be made the false statement or representation, he was acting willfully, that is, deliberately or on purpose and not because of mistake, inadvertence or accident.'' As for the document destruction charge, the judge said the jury could convict only if it believes North altered or destroyed the materials `` with knowledge of the illegality of his conduct.'' But `` the defendant did not have to know the exact terms of the law, if he knew that he was prohibited, by departmental or agency rule or regulation, from destroying official records.'' To convict North for accepting an illegal gratuity _ the security system _ <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said the jury must first be satisfied that <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` specifically intended to receive the security system for a past or future official act or acts, and not for reasons wholly unrelated to his official employment.'' Most of the charges carry penalties of five years in prison and $ 250,000 fines upon conviction. One charge is punishable by a maximum of 10 years, one of three years and one of two years _ with the total possible punishment being 60 years and fines of $ 3 million.

<TEXT>
 A jogger raped and bludgeoned by a gang running wild in Central Park remained in a coma Saturday while eight teen-agers awaited arraignment on charges of attempted murder. The 28-year-old Wall Street investment banker, who was left for dead by her attackers Wednesday night, was in critical condition on life-support systems, said <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>. The woman's family, which arrived from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, kept a vigil at her bedside, <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. Doctors said the next few days were critical to her recovery from massive head and brain injuries. By early Saturday, police had arrested eight suspects, ages 14 to 17, and charged them as adults with attempted murder, rape and assault. Police said the teen-agers jumped the woman from the bushes and used a pipe and a rock to batter her unconscious during the attack, which was the final act of the gang's night of `` wilding'' _ a street term for random pack violence. More than 30 teen-agers went on a two-hour rampage through the park in which nine people were beaten or terrorized. The jogger was found unconscious 3 -LCB- hours later and had lost three-quarters of her blood. The suspects were to be arraigned late Saturday or Sunday.

<HEAD>Walesa Expects Solidarity to Shrink</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> predicted Saturday that his newly legalized labor movement will dwindle as it gives rise to splinter groups during the growing political pluralism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Speaking at a news conference at the end of a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, he also praised President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and voiced his support for economic reforms in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` From Solidarity, other economic and political organizations will be born,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, a strong proponent of pluralism. `` Solidarity for the moment is huge, but it will become smaller with the growth of other organizations. This is the logical course of events.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Communist government last week lifted the ban on Solidarity and agreed to free elections for a new chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Solidarity was crushed in martial law in 1981 and later outlawed. The government is now seeking support from Solidarity and aid from the West to restore <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s shattered economy. In its heyday, the union claimed 10 million members of the 18 million-member Polish work force. Coinciding with the official recognition of Solidarity, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration announced a $ 1 billion economic aid program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Speaking through an interpreter, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> called the program `` a great step forward taken by Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` We ask <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the world to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> travel the road of development. We have laid the foundations, and if we do n't succeed, the responsibility will also be yours,'' he said. The union leader reiterated his support for the liberal reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Asked about Solidarity's contacts with opposition in other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said his labor movement was open to ties with other groups. But he added, `` We do n't want to disturb anyone and above all create obstacles for perestroika.'' `` Perestroika'' is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of social and political reforms. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who won the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize, indicated he planned to visit other countries as an `` ambassador of Solidarity'' but gave no details. He came to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> seeking both Western economic investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the blessing of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a Pole, for the country's new political course. He also met with Italian political leaders and union officials, who invited him to make the trip. Later Saturday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> flew back to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. He planned to meet Sunday with an opposition committee naming candidates for parliamentary elections in June.

<TEXT>
 `` Steer course 359,'' the skipper tells me as I swing the rudder left 10 degrees and wait for the bow of my 800-foot tanker to move slowly to port. Only one problem: It gets to course 359 and the simulated ship keeps right on going. A wild spin of the wheel in the opposite direction gives a moment of calm, then the realization I have overcorrected and the ship is headed in the other direction. The glacier-like handling of oil tankers is a problem for pilots from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. It is one reason instructors here at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Maritime Academy scoff at <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>'s suggestion that a child could steer a tanker through the Alaskan waters where the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground and spilled 10.1 million gallons of oil. A recent turn at the helm of an imaginary tanker proved that reporters, if not children, are wholly unqualified to guide the floating oil fields to port. The year-old, $ 800,000 simulator here is a full-scale tanker bridge. An array of computer and video equipment projects a realistic view of a harbor during the day, at night, at twilight or in fog. In the foreground, hundreds of `` feet'' away, is the prow of my 80,000-ton tanker, nearly as long but much lighter than the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>. I stand at a virtual duplicate of the type of wheel and rudder control stand found on most ships. In front of me, the shipmaster, academy Professor <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> McGourthy </PERSON>, stands by the compass and gives orders while another professor, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushy </PERSON>, serving as a chief mate, looks over my shoulder. `` Driving a ship is like piloting airplanes: hours and hours of boredom with intermittent moments of terror,'' <PERSON> Bushy </PERSON> says as our ship moves toward a channel at about 9 knots. Later Bushy programs the radar computer to show Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, and I watch as a radar blip identified as the Exxon Valdez passes me and approximates the course of the 987-foot, 211,000-ton ship to the reef that made the Valdez infamous. Still a mystery in the Valdez disaster is why the ship veered more than two miles off course and into <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. A miscalculation about the location of the reef might have left the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> with no time to respond. A supertanker travels thousands of feet before it executes a full turn; an emergency stop can take miles of water. On our radar screen, Bushy brings the Exxon Valdez close to the reef, marked with a buoy, and then tries to avoid it. `` We gave it hard right rudder and we're well beyond the buoy and we're probably aground by now'' because of the reaction time required for a loaded tanker like the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bushy </PERSON> says. The four-year academy trains its 550 students on both simulators and ships and awards bachelor's degrees in marine engineering or navigation. Graduates typically go to work in the maritime industry or for the Goast Guard or the military. The terror Bushy speaks of seems hard to imagine from the stable deck of the maritime academy _ until the computer operator switches the video simulator to night mode and a clear view of my channel approach becomes a jumble of lights. A grouping of seemingly stationary green, red and white lights means nothing to me, but to my superior officers it represents an approaching ship. Soon the distant lights are passing swiftly to port, a scant 50 yards away _ too close for comfort. Evasive action in a tanker is a slow-motion maneuver; the tanker I was operating would need a mile to go from full ahead to a full stop, and in that maneuver it would swing out of control as much as 60 degrees. The ship would continue to move forward five lengths in making a right-angle turn. Slowing down might seem a smart thing for a novice to do. But below 5 knots, the tanker responds poorly in a turn and is more susceptible to wind and current. And going slow ca n't be quickly corrected. At one point, McGourthy increases speed to compensate for my sloppy steering. `` I kicked up the speed five minutes ago and we're only up one knot,'' he says. The number of oil tankers has dwindled by several hundred in recent years to 3,180, said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But the average cargo is on the rise, raising the stakes in navigating them properly. The Exxon Valdez accident, said Capt. <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Motte </PERSON>, the academy's vice president, was `` an error in judgment And that's what these simulators can cure. We can cram into a week the kind of experience it would take years to get into at sea.'' The commanders at the academy scratch their heads trying to figure out how the Valdez ran aground. But they refuse to second-guess the crew without knowing the facts. `` I do n't believe there's a shipmaster afloat, including me, that would n't admit to being in a few close shaves,'' <PERSON> Motte </PERSON> said. `` I've never been in a collision and never been in a grounding, but I've come close.'' So have I, skipper. So have I.

Another retired rear admiral, <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, bought the plane for an undisclosed price 13 years ago and donated it to the museum at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, now a waiter at a <LOCATION> Polynesian </LOCATION> restaurant at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>; his wife, <PERSON> Van </PERSON>, an electronics worker, and four of their children came from their Winter Park home for the dedication ceremony. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said he worried for a moment about destroying the choppers, but `` the situation was desperate.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had flown through Viet Cong gunfire in dense fog, heading out to sea without knowing what was ahead. The plane was miles from shore and running low on fuel when he spotted the Midway, which saved 3,000 refugees. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had no radio, so he attempted to drop a note onto the deck asking permission to land. He said he was afraid to fly too low for fear the crew might think it was under attack and shoot down the plane. Three times he dropped notes attached to a knife, a boot and a key chain. but each was too light and blew away. On the fourth attempt, a note tied to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s survival pistol hit the carrier's deck. It read: `` Can you move these helicopters to the other side, I can land on your runway, I can fly 1 hour more, we have enough time to move. Please rescue me. Major Bung-Ly wife and 5 child.'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said there was n't space to move the UH-1 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> helicopters, so he ordered them pushed overboard. The single-engine plane touched down once, bounced and rolled to a stop. `` The crew was ecstatic to see the major make his first carrier landing,'' <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq Report No Progress on Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> resumed direct peace talks Saturday, but they appeared no closer to a permanent truce than when negotiations began eight months ago. <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, leaving after 2 -LCB- hours of talks with his Iranian counterpart, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, said the meeting brought only a reiteration of clashing positions. Asked if there was any progress on clearing those obstacles, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> replied, `` I can not say yes.'' The talks were chaired by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who also had two separate session in the past 24 hours with the Iranian minister in an apparent attempt to soften positions. Another session was planned Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> said. Periodic U.N.-sponsored talks began five days after an Aug. 20 cease-fire but immediately stalled over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s demand for a full withdrawal of Iraqi troops from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence on early dredging of the Shatt-al-Arab, its only sea outlet. The latest sessions started Thursday with a joint ministerial meeting that <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said did not deal with substantive issues. Talks are tentatively scheduled to recess Monday, but participants have left open the possibility of an extension. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cornelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommaruga </PERSON>, said he met Perez de Cuellar Saturday and expressed renewed concern that all prisoners of war taken in the Iran-Iraq war must be repatriated. He said priority should continue to be given to wounded and sick POWs, but also to captured children and the longest-held prisoners. The Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> ICRC </ORGANIZATION> monitors compliance with the Geneva Conventions on international humanitarian law. The <ORGANIZATION> ICRC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to supervise a POW exchange last November, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> quickly pulled out of the accord after charging <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had reneged. Only about 700 prisoners, mostly Iranians, have returned home since the cease-fire took effect. The <ORGANIZATION> ICRC </ORGANIZATION> says both sides together hold about 100,000 POWs captured in the eight-year war.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s intervention with <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators on behalf of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessmen did not strictly violate ethical standards, according to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, but its report provides an inside peek at how truly hard-ball politics is played in the nation's capital. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, according to a report by the ethics panel's general counsel, put a `` hold'' on a bill in late 1986 to provide regulators $ 15 billion through special fees on the industry to close the most critically insolvent savings and loan institutions, many of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. During the same period, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was meeting with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the thrift industry, on behalf of four <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessmen _ two of them <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund-raisers _ deeply embroiled in the S & amp; L crisis. Despite split votes by the ethics committee clearing <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of specific violations of House rules in those meetings, special counsel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> concluded <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> exercised `` undue influence'' in two of the cases and in trying to get two of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s toughest regulators fired. And several <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials told the committee of instances in which they felt compelled to bow to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s demands in order to prevent collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L insurance fund that guarantees depositors against losses up to $ 100,000. At the time, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- subsidiary had only a $ 3 billion _ a fraction of what it would need _ to rescue of depositors in 130 `` severely troubled'' S & amp; Ls. A combination of plummeting real estate values from the collapse of the Oil Belt economy plus Ponzi schemes by `` high flyer'' real estate developers who jumped into the S & amp; L business, particularly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with its loose banking regulations, had made many of their outstanding loans worthless. As the crisis developed, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in May 1986 asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to recapitalize the S & amp; L insurance fund with $ 15 billion to be financed through special assessments on member institutions. The bill was put on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calendar for action on Sept. 29. But two weeks earlier _ on Sept. 15 _ <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, then the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader, called the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s then-chairman, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, to his office to complain about `` heavy-handed'' and `` Gestapo-like'' tactics of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> regional officials in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. On Sept. 2, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had met in his Fort Worth office with <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a Dallas-based real estate syndicator and one of the largest owners of real estate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Hall complained to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> was too inflexible, according to the Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s report <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said he could not keep current with hundreds of millions in dollars in loans with more than 20 S & amp; Ls because of the worsening <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> economy. He had arranged `` global'' repackaging deal with all but one of them, Westwood Savings and Loan of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, which held approximately $ 200 million of his loans. Because of its already severe loan losses, <PERSON> Westwood </PERSON> was under the control of a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> representative. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> official had concluded it would be less expensive for the federal insurance fund to foreclose on <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s property and let him go bankrupt rather than accept the restructuring package. Shortly after the Sept. 2 meeting, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to complain about the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> representative running <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> and asked him `` if there was not anything he could do about this,'' according to <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. On Sept. 26, a Friday, Hall, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials learned that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had put a hold on the $ 15 billion S & amp; L insurance fund recapitalization scheduled for House action the following Monday. Three days later, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> replaced the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s representative at <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>. The bill was put back on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> calendar for Oct. 6 and passed the next day. But for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s request, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> told the ethics committee, `` I would have taken some other corrective action, such as, ` You're going to have to be more communicative, listen better, be more prepared.' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made no specific threats nor used any coercive terms. At the same time, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said he was convinced he was being asked to remove the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> official overseeing <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION>. `` Anybody who has worked in the government for very long knows that when the Speaker _ soon to be the Speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> _ is asking you to look into it, it's not just anybody.'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbanks </PERSON>, then the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of staff, told the ethics committee that <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and other agency officials felt they were under extreme pressure to bow to that request and several others by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> before the bill, in a different version, was signed into law 11 months later. `` Ed -LRB- Gray -RRB- believed that he was being posed a choice,'' she said. `` And that choice was: <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> has a significant problem with your system; you say your system needs money, but I am not going to be prepared to give that system money unless I see evidence that your system is capable of responding; and that evidence can be provided by being responsive to <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>.'' As a result, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> felt compelled to compromise its regulatory standards in order to obtain the funds it needed. `` Throughout that whole period, we tormented, and we did n't like what we did,'' she told the ethics committee. `` I had spent a lot of years growing up talking theoretically about means and ends, and the end here was the ability to start to close down these institutions with adequate money. But the means was a perversion of the system.'' <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the ethics committee's counsel, said neither <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> nor his staff ever looked at the merits of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s regulatory activities or gave any consideration to the legal bases for its actions. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> likened <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s actions to `` blackmail'' and said he `` called for reconsideration regardless of the legal justification. Blocking of the recapitalization bill after his call regarding <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> constituted a prohibited suggestion of reprisal.'' In August 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> finally received a $ 10.8 billion recapitalization package, but only after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had threatened to veto any amount less. During the interim, it had been cut to $ 5 billion at one point through the efforts of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry's biggest lobbying arm and a large source of political campaign funds. Of the $ 38 billion that the government committed in 1988 to closing down or merging insolvent S & amp; Ls, $ 25 billion involved institutions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or defaults on loans from thrifts in other states for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> real estate ventures. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved an S & amp; L bailout bill with a minimum estimated costs of $ 126 billion _ two-thirds of if from taxpayers _ over the next 10 years. `` We would not be here today talking about a $ 126 billion problem if we had passed the $ 15 billion in <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> recapitalization in October of 1986,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, R-Utah and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in opening the debate last Monday. `` I'm not going to insult anybody's intelligence by saying that $ 15 billion would have solved the problem, but it's safe to say the problem would be at least half what it is today,'' <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said. `` It would have provided funds to close down a lot of those brain-dead institutions before they continued to make bad loans.''

<HEAD>Hussein Believes Prospects Good for Middle East Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite widespread mob violence at home, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> seemed almost ebullient during his visit here this past week, reflecting his view that the parties to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict may finally be ready to grapple seriously with the issues that divide them. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has watched the tumultuous politics of his region from up close for almost as long as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has existed, and he senses that the possibilities for peace are rising. `` The conditions are as ripe as they've never been for progress towards a final comprehensive peace in the area,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Saturday on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Novak'' program. A senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official told a group of American reporters Thursday not long after <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> had concluded his talks with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that the king and the president saw eye-to-eye. `` His majesty and the president had almost identical views on almost every subject that was discussed,'' said the official, who asked not to be quoted by name. It was a mixed week for <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, with at least the promise of progress toward a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement on the one hand coupled somewhat incongruously on the other with rampaging rioters at home protesting recent price increases. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s visit capped off an intensive period of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomacy for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. He had been preceded here by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have known each other for years, and their mutual regard was evident both in their public statements and the deferential manner in which they treated each other during the hours they spent together on Wednesday, culminating in a glittering White House state dinner. The senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official said he believes the new administration may pursue a more evenhanded policy on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He said it is more likely now than before that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be perceived `` by both sides -LRB- <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israelis </LOCATION> -RRB- that it is taking the genuine interests of both sides into consideration.'' Aside from an American president perceived to be better suited to advance the peace process, the official also said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has come a long way from the time when it was refusing negotiation, recognition or peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ `` the three noes.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, he said, has retreated on each of these points and now, it `` has accepted all the American stipulations.'' Beyond that, he added, the new <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> position `` has overwhelming Arab support.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is encouraged by the U.S.-PLO dialogue which began last December and by the similarity of views between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on the possibility of a U.N.-sponsored international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The official was critical of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, suggesting that `` our three noes'' have been replaced by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s `` five noes.'' These include, he said, no recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, no independent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, no withdrawal from the occupied territories, no withdrawal from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and no international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Still, the official said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> seems to have been chastened by the 17 months of turmoil in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and may be more flexible than before. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> now says that `` no option is excluded'' in negotiations for a final settlement, suggesting a retreat from his previous position that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposes any surrender of territory in exchange for peace, the official said. None of the parties to the conflict has rejected outright <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s call for Palestinian elections in the territories as an initial step in a broader peace process. But all the parties concur that negotiations on the objective of the elections and the next steps beyond that stage en route to a final settlement will be fraught with difficulties. Nonethelss, as the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official described it, `` the important thing is to start a process. The status quo is not possible to maintain. Advocating the status quo means advocating a deterioration of the situation.''

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Saturday it is building a sophisticated Soviet-designed battle tank and developing a new long-range missile as part of a major program to beef up its weapons industry. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amer </PERSON> <PERSON> Sa </PERSON> ` di, chief of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military industries, also said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is negotiating with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to build advanced Mirage 2000 fighters and with four other aircraft companies to build their He also disclosed that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will participate in an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> arms exhibition that begins April 28.

The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s main army supplier, provided <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> with hundreds of T-72s during the war. They were widely used in a string of Iraqi victories that forced <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to accept a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20. Sa ` di said the military also will display new Iraqi-made weapons at the `` You will see more sophisticated, more advanced missiles with a longer range and better capabilities than we used against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' he declared. `` Many people are going to be surprised at what we will put on display at the show and with the variety and quality,'' he said. Among other displays will be Soviet air force MiG-29 fighter jets with Sukhoi Su-24 and Su-25 fighter-bombers, he said. The respected London-based <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> reported in December that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has supplied <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with an unspecified number of advanced Su-25s.

<TEXT>
 The judge in the <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> trial, saying it was all a misunderstanding, on Saturday released 12 uncensored pages of a court transcript that previously had been released with large portions blacked out by the court security officer. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and nine other news organization filed a motion with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on Friday asking for an uncut version of the transcript, which was of the closing remarks made in open court Wednesday by North lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. The heaviest deletions were of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s references to `` intercepts'' of information that tracked the shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1985. The intercepts, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in the blacked out portion, told <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> officials `` where they were, when they were delivered, what ocean they were over and when they got there.'' At another point, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, the materials were distributed by hand _ not even sent by messenger _ because `` it is the most guarded, most closely held intelligence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government.'' In ordering the documents' release, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that until the news media complaint arrived, `` the court was unaware that through a misunderstanding'' the portions were blacked out. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, however, denied another news media request for a sealed stipulation about top-secret intercepts about the Iranian initiative collected in 1985 and 1986 at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s request by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Sylvia Plath's Tombstone Returned; Husband Lashes at Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The stone has been returned to the grave of <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>, restoring the married name that vandals _ perhaps her admirers _ have repeatedly tried to erase. On Saturday, Poet Laureate <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> struck back at recent criticism of his custody of the grave and of the legacy of his wife, the tormented American poet who killed herself Feb. 11, 1963 at the age of 30. `` When I first had the lettering set into the stone ... the only question in my mind was how to get the name <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> on to it,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said in a letter printed in Saturday's edition of The Independent. `` If I had followed custom, the stone would be inscribed <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, which was her legal name. For her children, it was their mother's name.'' But, he added, `` I was already well aware, in 1963, of what she had achieved under that name, and I wished to honor it.'' <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was posthumously honored with the Pulitzer Prize in 1982. She was estranged from <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> at the time of her death, and some of her partisans have accused him of smothering her in housework and leaving her for another woman. Many of her poems were intensely personal. Some of the best-known ones, such as `` Lady Lazarus'' and `` Daddy,'' deal with illness, suffering and death. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> burned the last volume of her journals, saying he did not want their son and daughter ever to have to read them. He said that her married name, set in riveted lead letters, was chiseled off the tombstone three times. After a fourth attempt, he had the stone removed and was contemplating a new design. However, he said, he found the stone had been repaired last year by the engraver who was keeping it and he agreed to have it restored to its place near the Church of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> the Apostle in the village of <LOCATION> Heptonstall </LOCATION>. The stone bears the name <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and a line of poetry: `` Even amidst fierce flames the golden lotus can be planted.'' It is a sentence from Sanskrit that `` I used to tell her when she was low,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. The controversy was stirred up earlier this month when <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Parnaby </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingfield </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> wrote to The Guardian newspaper complaining about the lack of a marker on the grave. `` By failing to replace the headstone and thus leaving <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>'s grave unidentifiable, her place in the tradition of women's literature is being denied and her work devalued,'' they In a long letter published Thursday in The Guardian, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> attacked the two women for falsely claiming that he and <PERSON> Plath </PERSON> had signed divorce papers. `` I am no great student in the <LOCATION> Fantasia </LOCATION> which has obscured the life and death of <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>, but so far as I am aware Ms. <PERSON> Parnaby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wingfield </PERSON> are the first in 26 years to decide that this bit of her history needs to be rewritten,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> wrote. `` There is rather more to it. Perhaps Ms. <PERSON> Parnaby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wingfield </PERSON> will plead that they did not invent this bit of apocrypha, but that certain other people have been accepting it as gospel for some time. `` If that is so, perhaps it would explain why <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Plath </PERSON>'s grave has been so repeatedly vandalized Ms. <PERSON> Parnaby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wingfield </PERSON>'s wording of their mischievous falsehood can be read, to my mind, very like an incitement for other misguided enthusiasts to desecrate the grave afresh.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' letter to The Independent took issue with an article by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON>, who complained that <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> and his sister had kept `` a firm grip on biographers,'' to the extent of threatening to withhold copyright material from authors who criticized <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' family `` Mr. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> tells us that ` nobody owns fact.' I hope each of us owns the facts of her or his own life,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> wrote. `` Otherwise you, reader, might suddenly find yourself reinvented by a Mr. <PERSON> Hayman </PERSON> who had decided that he owns your facts and can do what he likes with them.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> heir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> rewrote his will last year after a tax law was changed, eliminating a trust that could have brought millions to the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The trust was in a 1987 will but was deleted in a will dated June 1988, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON>, the biggest shareholder and former chairman of the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, company, died of a heart attack April 9 at age 70. His father invented condensed soup. Under the previous will, income from a trust would have benefited the museum, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a prep school in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, the newspaper reported. Income from the trust would have continued for 25 years. The trust would have gotten the bulk of <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON>'s estate, the newspaper said, but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON> often was included in lists of the nation's richest people with a fortune estimated at $ 1.5 billion. Under the new will, <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON> left nothing to the two schools, both of which he had attended, the newspaper said. The museum will get two valuable pieces of porcelain as well as $ 5 million that <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON> had pledged before his death. Most of the estate will be divided equally among his six grandchildren. Its value was not specified in the will. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Rombach </PERSON> said Saturday he could not confirm that a will had been filed or give details of any previous will. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Horrocks </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the museum, said Saturday she would have no comment. <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jacquelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Savani </PERSON> did not immediately return a telephone message Saturday seeking comment. His will was changed after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> revoked a `` generation-skipping'' estate tax break offered to grandchildren of wealthy people who form large trusts that provide income to charities, the newspaper said. Charitable groups had lobbied <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to revise the tax break, arguing it would lead to fewer gifts. <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> would have received 50 percent of the income from the trust, the museum 40 percent and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s 10 percent, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON> was chairman of the art museum board. His $ 5 million pledge was the biggest cash gift the museum had ever received. `` We are thankful for his vast generosity given during his lifetime,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rishel </PERSON>, museum curator of 19th-century art. The value of the two pieces of porcelain _ nearly life-size goats made of Meissen china in the early 18th century _ has not been disclosed, but <PERSON> Rishel </PERSON> said the figures are `` fabulous, really spectacular, real showstoppers.''

 The army on Saturday barred <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leftists carrying black flags of mourning from entering the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION>, the site of a bloody raid by border police that killed five people. Also Saturday, officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mukassed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said a Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities had died Thursday of stab wounds. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports identified the man as <PERSON> Musallam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>, 40, and said masked youths broke into his <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> home and attacked him because they suspected him of cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Another suspected collaborator, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman, was hospitalized with broken limbs after being beaten for at least two days by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> militants, the army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 16 Palestinians, including six children under the age of 15, were wounded in clashes with troops, Arab hospital officials said. An army official confirmed five wounded. Throughout the occupied lands, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> observed a general strike called by the pro-PLO leaders of the uprising. Shops were shuttered and transportation came to a halt. In <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, activists blocked roads with stones to enforce the strike. Israeli legislator <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> led a convoy of 20 cars draped with black flags to <LOCATION> Nahalin </LOCATION>, but the group was stopped by troops slightly more than a mile outside the village. <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> said soldiers told him the area was closed to civilians. `` It's possible to block our entrance, but they ca n't block our message of total opposition to the massacre that happened in the village,'' <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Preliminary results of an army investigation showed that border police fired indiscriminately during their April 13 search-and-arrest raid in the village. In the occupied territories, border police are under army command and are often dispatched on such raids. At <LOCATION> Mukassed </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, 25-year-old <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Najadereh </PERSON> died late Friday of head wounds sustained in the raid, hospital officials said. His death brought the death toll in the raid to five. The deaths of <LOCATION> Najadereh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> raised to 442 the number of Palestinians killed since the December 1987 start of the uprising. Eighteen Israelis also died. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, 32-year-old <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON> was hospitalized with multiple fractures after being held by members of a so-called Palestinian strike force, army officials and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. The militants broke into Mrs. <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON>'s home in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> on Tuesday night and beat her with clubs and sticks because they believed she collaborated with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said an Arab reporter, quoting the woman's neighbors. `` She was shouting ` I'll stop, I'll stop!''' the reporter quoted the neighbors as saying. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said Mrs. <PERSON> Kanaan </PERSON> was held for three days. Since the start of the uprising, dozens of Palestinians, including several women, have been killed by fellow Palestinians who accused them of collaboration.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Saturday told delegates to the African American Summit'89 that black election victories mean little if economic opportunity does n't follow. `` We have not been successful here if we've been legislated in and regulated out,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said on the second day of the three-day conference billed as a meeting to set a political and social agenda for the 1990s. Touching on numerous other topics, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stressed the need for awareness among Americans of blacks' African heritage, a theme he has sounded often this year as a leader in a movement to supplant the term `` black'' with `` African American.'' `` We are not descended from slaves, nor up from slavery, but rather Africans who were enslaved. ... The African roots in American civilization must be taught in all American schools,'' the civil rights leader said. A candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> complained that a lack of unity was a key reason <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> won the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> mayoral race earlier this year over black candidate <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> lost because `` we broke the three rules: A house divided against itself can not win, do unto others as you would have them do unto you and love one another as I have loved you,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also ridiculed judicial decisions against affirmative action, particularly a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision striking down a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, program setting aside 30 percent of contracting jobs for minorities. `` It's not about the 70 percent the whites were already getting,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` It's about the other 30 percent they want.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s stirring 45-minute speech drew the largest crowd so far in the conference, filling for the first time the 1,000 seats set up in a corner of the huge <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting drew only half the number organizers had predicted and about 1,700 fewer than attended a similar rally organized by then-Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, in 1972. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> is chairman of this weekend's gathering. `` I'm disappointed in the turnout,'' said <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` But I think what's important is there were good people who did come out.''

<HEAD>Explosion in Moscow Watch Factory Touches Off Disaster Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fire and explosion in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> watch factory killed two people, injured two others and touched off rumors that a radioactive cloud had been released over the Soviet capital, official media said Saturday. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the worries were based on `` incredible and unfounded'' rumors. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city council was besieged with telephone calls Friday night from Muscovites worried that their neighborhood might be contaminated by poisonous gas released by the explosion earlier in the day. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> said some Muscovites were concerned that radiation might have leaked into the air. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, in dismissing the worries, said authorities were trying to determine who called child-care centers to tell them to keep children indoors and close windows. The fire and explosion occurred when plant workers installing new wiring in an unventilated area accidentally ignited a gas leak, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The blast killed a woman worker, and an electrician was burned and later died. Two other women were hospitalized with injuries. `` Troubled Muscovites were inquiring as to what kind of explosion happened Friday morning at one of the enterprises of the Cheremyshkinsky region and how dangerous it was for people living in neighboring areas,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Soviet Paper Identifies Chemical Used in Georgia, Says it Not Fatal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Saturday that an irritating chemical agent was used on pro-independence demonstrators in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, but it quoted an official as saying the substance does not cause suffocation or poisoning. However, the newspaper acknowledged a report in the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, <LOCATION> Zarya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vostoka </LOCATION>, that 61 people suffering poisoning symptoms were hospitalized in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and that some were in `` grave condition.'' Georgian activists claim several of the 19 people killed when soldiers broke up an April 9 demonstration were victims of poison gas. They also say military authorities refused to identify the substance or tell doctors how to treat patients suffering from exposure to it. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> paper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> identified the substance as `` cheremukha.'' Soviet officials have previously said `` tear gas'' was used in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> but have given no further details. `` We used only ` cheremukha,' and it alone,'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> quoted a representative of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, Maj.-Gen. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON>, as saying. `` It is a substance basically consisting of chloroacetophenone ... ` Cheremukha' is an irritant, but it does not cause suffocation or poisoning.'' A Western military attache in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said the substance's base was a type of incapacitating agent stronger than tear gas and akin to what is commonly known in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as `` CS.'' <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON> told the newspaper only 27 cartridges of the substance were used by soldiers, `` and not in the square in front of Government House where people were killed, but in two other places'' on the capital city's main thoroughfare, <LOCATION> Rustaveli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prospekt </LOCATION>. He said internal security troops attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> used the chemical on his order, `` as they say, when passions ` had burst their banks.''' Despite <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON>'s contention the chemical can not cause poisoning or suffocation, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported in its issue last week that the substance used on protesters could have been a factor in the fatalities. `` The use of gas in great concentrations can lead to the instantaneous loss of consciousness,'' <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said. `` A helpless person then falls under the feet of a running crowd.'' <PERSON> Yefimov </PERSON> said the use of the chemical was authorized by a July 28 decree from the Supreme Soviet Presidium, which says `` special means'' may be used for `` suppressing mass unrest, group violations of public order and other anti-social activities.'' He claimed the April 9 rally in front of <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> government headquarters fell into that category because `` seizure of political power, overthrow of the present regime and the separation of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> were publicly discussed.'' <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s leadership assumed responsibility for the clash and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and premier resigned. The protests began in early April in reaction to demands by the small <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> to be separated from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. They evolved into massive protests by groups depending Georgian independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

 Hundreds of thousands of soccer fans stood silently Saturday in streets and stadiums across <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to commemorate 95 people killed at a game one week earlier. From Brechin, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> on the southwest coast of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, fans at <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> stadiums observed a minute of silence seven days to the minute after the disaster halted their season. The league estimated a half million fans took part. The 95 people died at the <LOCATION> Liverpool-Nottingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> cup semifinal match at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> stadium in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> in the crush of an overcrowded standing-room-only section. Reports from the press and officials have blamed the deaths on drunkeness, hooliganism, poor crowd control, and the stadium design itself. However, government inquiries are still under way. In <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, residents took their grief into the streets. Pedestrians halted, traffic lights stayed red, and traffic stopped for one minute. In some areas, trains halted and shops closed briefly. In <LOCATION> Nottingham </LOCATION>'s city center, air raid sirens sounded for the first time since VE Day in 1945, when <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> surrendered to the Allies. At <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> stadium, more than 1,000 people gathered outside gates where fans surged into the grounds a week ago and created the lethal crush. Inside, 300 relatives and friends of victims paid private respects, and no game was played. The bells of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> rang for six minutes _ the amount of time the <LOCATION> Liverpool-Nottingham </LOCATION> game had been going on when the tragedy began. At <LOCATION> Anfield </LOCATION> stadium, the home turf of the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> team, no game was played either. Almost half the field was carpeted with flowers, and the standing-room terraces were festooned with team scarves and other tributes to the dead. A one-mile chain of thousands of red and blue scarves joined the stadiums of rival teams <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Everton </ORGANIZATION>. The final scarf was tied by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Devenside </PERSON>, father of 18-year-old victim <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>. Afterward, team director <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> led the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> players onto the field at <LOCATION> Anfield </LOCATION> stadium.

<TEXT>
 The head of the nation's biggest union said Saturday he will call a strike next month to protest government austerity measures that earlier this year prompted the worst rioting in Venezuelan history. The one-day strike, which would be the first major work stoppage in 31 years of democratic government, `` will definitely go'' in May, said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Delpino </PERSON>, president of the Venezuelan Workers Confederation. The union plans to hold a two-day congress next week to discuss strategy for fighting the belt-tightening program, which resulted in sharp increases in bus fares, gasoline and other goods and services. The austerity plan, the result of an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> so <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> could ease its $ 33 billion foreign debt, spurred violent protests in February. More than 300 people were killed and 2,000 injured in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> alone. The labor group represents 3 million of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s 5.8 million workers. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> called the threatened strike `` suicide, because nobody would join it.'' `` The strike and the massive obedience to our call will be the response to that claim,'' <PERSON> Delpino </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, an oil-producing nation whose economy has collapsed as petroleum prices have plunged, had experienced little labor unrest before February's riots. `` Venezuelan workers are living through the worst crisis since the -LRB- labor group -RRB- was created,'' <PERSON> Delpino </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Workers have felt the severe impact of the economic policy.'' The austerity program eliminated subisides on more than 25 basic food products and implemented an indexing system that tied wage increases to inflation rates. Despite the friction between the union and the government, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> is to open Monday's labor congress.

<HEAD>Lebanese Report Says Israel Expels 60 Families From South Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Lebanese newspaper said Saturday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has expelled 60 families from their farms in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after they refused to sell the army their land. An Israeli army official in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> called the reports `` not true, totally unfounded.'' In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force said he had no reports of villagers being expelled. Lebanese police could not immediately confirm the report. The daily <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said a 500-strong Israeli force backed by 30 armored personnel carriers stormed seven farms around the town of Shibaa Friday and rounded up 300 people. Shibaa lies within <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone, a six-to-10-mile-deep strip patrolled by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops and Israeli-backed militiamen. `` The commander told the farmers they have either to sell their 10-square-mile land to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or give it up,'' <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said. It quoted unidentified residents as saying the Israelis opened fire to force the farmers out, but that no casualties were reported. The farmers loaded their belongings on 300 mules and left for Shibaa, along with their 30,000 goats and 500 cows, <PERSON> An-Nahar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said: `` We received a petition from the village signed by 142 people. They said they were informed -LRB- by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB- that their land would be confiscated for military purposes.'' `` Some villagers have said they have been offered compensation, but most do n't want to accept it,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force began investigating the reports after the Lebanese government filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> expelled 70 Lebanese civilians from Shibaa and several villages in the security zone earlier this year for refusing to cooperate with the area's Israeli-sponsored local administration. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out its security zone when it withdrew the bulk of its occupation army from southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1985. The strip, which extends from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> coast in the west to the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION> in the east, serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks against northern Israeli settlements.

 <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, removed in May as head of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after 32 years in power, is unable to carry out his official functions because of poor health, a government minister said Saturday. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, 76, was replaced by <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> as party leader at a special conference and given the honorary post of party president. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> attended the second half of a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month but has been absent from recent party meetings.

They claimed he halted <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s economic and political reforms in the 1970s and crticized his role in backing the Soviet-led invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in 1968 that crushed that nation's `` Prague Spring'' reforms. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said the more than three decades of <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>'s rule should be reviewed but <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> probably would not become personally involved in any such review because of his health In another development, a fourth man who had been invited to rejoin the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after being expelled a year ago will remain outside the party, according to a broadcast on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> radio. It reported <PERSON> Mihaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Bihari </PERSON>, a political scientist and reform communist, said there were `` incompatible differences'' between the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the four expelled last April. The three others, economist <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lengyel </PERSON>, historian <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Biro </PERSON> and parliamentary deputy <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON>, announced earlier last week that they would not rejoin the party. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the party's top disciplinary body, had reversed its expulsion order at a meeting Monday. <PERSON> Bihari </PERSON> was quoted by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> radio as saying the party is paralyzed by irreconcilable differences within its own ranks. There has been discussion in recent weeks about a possible split between the party's reform and orthodox wings.

 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 125,000 dockworkers called off a 6-day-old strike Saturday after reaching an agreement with the government on higher wages, news reports said. The strike had paralyzed operations in the country's 10 major ports. Sailors from the Indian navy were deployed to unload essential goods. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted Transport Minister <PERSON> Rajesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilot </PERSON> as saying the five striking trade unions of stevedores, or dockworkers, had reached a wage settlement with the government. He said the workers would report for duty by Monday. The workers had been demanding a 25 percent hike in wages but the government offered only a 15 percent increase. An Indian dockhand earns between $ 90 and $ 180 per month. Pilot did not specify the increase agreed to in negotiations but said the five-year settlement would satisfy the workers' demands by the end of the contract.

 A <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion-regulation dispute in which the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments Wednesday has generated the most `` friend-of-the-court'' briefs ever submitted in one case. The justices are being asked to use the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case to overturn or substantially limit its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. The landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision, based on a woman's constitutional right to privacy, said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor The court said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester when the fetus can survive outside the womb. State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made absolute, however. A federal appeals court, relying on <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, struck down as unconstitutional five key provisions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law now under scrutiny: _ A ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for performing abortions not necessary to save a woman's life _ A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or assisting an abortion _ A ban on using taxpayer money for `` encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions _ A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus reasonably believed to be older than 19 weeks is viable, capable of surving outside the womb, by determining lung maturity and other testing _ A declaration that the `` life of each human begins at conception. Here are excerpts of some of the arguments raised in friend-of-the-court briefs submitted to the justices. In all, the court received 45 such briefs supporting the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law and 33 briefs opposing it.

 _ From the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration: `` Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, as the court is well aware, has been intensely controversial from the day it was decided That controversy is more than simply a reflection of the deep divisions in American society over the underlying question of abortion. Rather, the controversy has, in substantial measure, been a product of the decision itself. `` Roe rests on assumptions that are not firmly grounded in the Constitution; it adopts an unworkable framework tying permissible state regulation of abortion to particular periods in pregnancy; and it has allowed courts to usurp the function of legislative bodies in weighing competing social, ethical and scientific factors in reaching a judgment as to how much state regulation is appropriate in this sensitive area.'' _ From the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>: `` In most nations of the world, abortion policy has not been the subject of constitutional intervention by a high court, remaining determined by a wide variety of legislative schemes The democratic compromises reached in developed Western nations are significantly more protective of fetal life than is <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>.'' _ From the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> for Religious and Civil Rights: `` Under ... <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, the states have an important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life from conception until birth, which interest becomes compelling at viability `` If the states' interest in the protection of fetal life becomes compelling at viability, it necessarily follows that the states possess the ability to require that the point of viability be determined. If the compelling nature of a state's interest in unborn human life ... is to be anything more than illusory, then <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> and its progeny should be read to permit those states desiring to protect fetal life to require a physician to make a determination, consistent with sound medical practice, as to viability.'' _ From the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>: `` Abortion jurisprudence needs resolution after 16 years of turmoil This court attempted to resolve the matter in 1973. Time has proven the effort a failure. This court is now confronted with the opportunity to restore a proper interpretation to the Constitution, returning this volatile matter of social policy to the proper fora _ the state legislatures.'' _ From Feminists for Life: `` There is ample evidence in the medical studies and public health statistics cited herein that the unfettered right of abortion on demand foisted upon our society by the court and by abortion advocates is a public health disaster the proportion of which we are just beginning to uncover. _ From Focus on Family and the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>: `` Changes in understanding and medical science will always outpace the court's ability to respond When this court's precedents are rooted in science and not in the Constitution, as was <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>'s trimester framework, science is pitted against precedent, and the prestige of this honorable institution suffers `` This court can best protect the interests of our citizens by abandoning the trimester approach as outmoded, unscientific and constitutionally unworkable, and by recognizing that the states have legitimate interests, existing throughout pregnancy, in protecting the life of the mother and the unborn child.'' _ From the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>: `` If the court seriously seeks support for abortion decisions in the historical line of privacy cases, it must reflect accurately that one person's ` liberty' is not ` license' to control even one's own body where another's interest could suffer or the common good be diminished _ From the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelists </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church-Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synod </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>: `` It has been argued that state laws prohibiting abortion unconstitutionally impose the religious beliefs and views of one religion upon persons not adhering to those views, thereby constituting an ` establishment' of religion prohibited by the First Amendment `` We do not advocate the imposition of our religious views by law in order to impose on others our religious beliefs. Rather, those religious beliefs are ... deeply seated in the moral and ethical system that forms the basis of much of the civil and criminal law of this nation ... The fact that a state's law coincides with a deeply held religious belief does not render that law unconstitutional under the First Amendment.''

 _ From the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and other medical groups: `` This court has observed that viability is usually placed at about seven months -LRB- 28 weeks -RRB- but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks Since the improvements in health care have resulted in greater survival of infants born at a gestational age of 24-28 weeks ... The earliest point at which a fetus can survive is 23-24 weeks.'' `` Thus, while substantial strides have occurred in saving infants born between 24 and 28 weeks, the earliest point at which an infant can survive has changed little. `` What the court found in 1973 is even more true today: the medical risks to a woman of childbirth are greater than the risks of abortion.'' _ From 167 scientists and physicians, including 11 Nobel laureates: `` There is no scientific consensus that a human life begins at conception, at a given stage of fetal development or at birth The question of ` when a human life begins' can not be answered by reference to scientific principles like those with which we predict planetary movement. The answer to that question will depend on each individual's social, religious, philosophical, ethical and moral beliefs and values. `` Assertions that viability has moved significantly earlier in fetal development are flatly contrary to the scientific evidence. Although advances in technology have improved the chances of survival of premature birth within the range of 24 to 28 weeks, the outer limit of viability at 24 weeks has not significantly changed. `` Roe vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> has not been rendered obsolete by subsequent advancements in science.'' _ From the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>: `` Five major reviews of the psychological and psychiatric literature published between 1975 and 1989 all confirm that for the overwhelming majority of women who undergo abortion, there are no long-term negative emotional effects `` When women experience regret, depression or guilt, such feelings are mild and diminish rapidly without adversely affecting general functioning. Severe emotional responses are rare, even in young women. To the contrary, the great majority of women who have had an abortion express feelings of relief.'' _ From the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>: `` Through its restrictions on the use of public facilities for the purpose of performing or assisting an abortion and on the use of public funds for the purpose of encouraging or counseling an abortion ... <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> has intruded deeply into the physician-patient relationship `` Missouri's restriction ... has the effect of prohibiting constitutionally protected conduct, and it is therefore unconstitutional.'' _ From Women -LRB- about 3,000 -RRB- who have had abortions, a compendium filed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>: `` Women's privacy and liberty interests ... would be substantially infringed upon by the provisions of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> statute at issue The option of abortion ... is fundamental to women's lives, liberty and their pursuit of happiness.'' _ From 281 American historians: `` At the time the federal Constitution was adopted, abortion was known and not illegal Abortion was not uncommon in colonial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` A presumed interest in protecting fetal life does not justify denying women their historic liberty to choose abortion.''

 Solidarity activists are scouting for offices, hooking up telephones and signing up volunteer poll watchers in a flurry of activity after regaining legal status for their independent labor movement. Near the center of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, a former history institute is being transformed into the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s national election headquarters. At another location, a small union press office has opened. At a third spot, opposition editors are planning to put out a newspaper. Solidarity volunteers _ university students, mothers on leave from jobs, longtime activists and others _ are struggling with typical Polish shortages of office supplies, furniture and phone lines. But they no longer need look over their shoulders. The government crushed Solidarity, the first independent union in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, during a martial law crackdown in 1981 and later banned it. After years of illegal activity, Solidarity recaptured its legal status when a government-controlled court lifted the ban Monday. The legalization stemmed from talks between the opposition and the government that concluded in an agreement April 5. The government also agreed to free elections to a new chamber of parliament and other electoral reforms in exchange for political and economic cooperation from Solidarity. Before it was suppressed, Solidarity claimed 10 million members. However, speaking at the end of a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> predicted Saturday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> that his labor movement will dwindle as it gives rise to splinter groups during the reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` From Solidarity, other economic and political organizations will be born,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. `` Solidarity for the moment is huge, but it will become smaller with the growth of other organizations. This is the logical course of events.'' The first major office to open in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> since legalization was the <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in an empty former history institute on the edge of the picturesque Saxon Garden park. The organization, technically separate from Solidarity, is racing against early deadlines for finding candidates. It is collecting nominating signatures, running campaigns, and training election observers for parliamentary voting scheduled for June 4 and June 18. On Friday, <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a veteran activist slated to run for the existing upper chamber of parliament, scrambled through the building holding quick chats with several prominent activists in the bustling center. `` It's full of problems,'' he replied when asked about the practical side of ushering in legal activity. `` We do n't have telephones, we do n't have space, we do n't have anything _ but we will.'' <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Litynski </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> regional chapter of Solidarity, said: `` The mood is getting hotter and hotter because of the elections.'' <PERSON> Anatol </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawina </PERSON>, a Solidarity representative to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said he hopes to line up 100,000 people nationwide to help guard against cheating at the 22,000 polling sites. Elsewhere in the country, local election offices and news bureaus were also being opened. The Election Newspaper, a newspaper that expects to circulate 500,000 copies, has found offices in an empty building in central <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Skalski </PERSON>, one of the editors. The paper will become the first opposition mass-circulation daily in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc with its first edition, scheduled for May.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a secret intelligence directive to provide more than $ 10 million in aid to opponents of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in that country's upcoming elections, a published report says. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the directive, called a `` finding,'' in February, according to the May 1 issue of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report. The magazine quotes unnamed sources as saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally lobbied the plan through the congressional intelligence committees and won approval for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to provide more than $ 10 million in aid _ including printing, advertising, transportation and communications _ to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> set a similar program in motion one year ago, the magazine said. Asked about the report on Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't comment on intelligence matters.''

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> signed a law Saturday that abolishes both prior censorship and the indefinite closures of newspapers and radio stations. The new code does not authorize private television stations, which had been sought by oppositon groups, but `` guarantees equal access to social and political groups'' to government-run television. The law was passed Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> signed it before before leaving on a two-week tour of 11 Western European nations to seek aid for his cash-strapped Sandinista government. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> claimed the new law is one of the most progressive in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because it does not provide for fines or permanent shutdowns of news outlets. But it does provide for temporary suspensions. The president also said journalists work in greater security in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> than in other Central American nations, and he mentioned <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where he said they face `` systematic terrorism.'' `` In other countries in the region, journalists, union leaders and opposition politicians are assassinated,'' he told reporters after signing the law. Major provisions of the new law include: _ Penalties for disseminating information deemed contrary to the interests of the state, for `` alterating'' government news releases, communiques and other statements, and for the `` transmission, diffusion, publication or projection of injurious, defamatory or false information. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> can order closures of up to four days and can order offending broadcasters or publishers to issue retractions, clarifications or corrections Broadcasters and publishers will have the right to a hearing before sanctions are applied. _ No prior censorship Under the previous law, the government could require the news media to submit copies of articles to the censor before publication or broadcast. And the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> could order the inderfinite suspension of news media without a hearing. The main opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and the radion station of the Nicaraguan Roman Catholic church were freequently shut down, sometimes for months at a time, and could only reopen with government approval. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> agreed at a meeting in February of the presidents of five Central American countries to reform <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s press laws and also the election code that will govern the general elections next February. On Saturday <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the four other Central American nations have failed to live up to part of the agreement that he said provided for producing a plan to dismantle the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras. He accused the governments of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> of `` trying to toy with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' And <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> again said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to block propects for peace in the region. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Friday extended a 4-year-old economic embargo against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, saying its leftist government poses `` an unusual and extraordinary threat'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security. On Tuesday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a measure that will provide $ 49.8 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras, most of whom are based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, until the Nicaraguan elections in February. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is `` throwing gasoline on the fires'' of Central American conflicts.

<HEAD>Cleanup of Waste Water Continues From Louisiana Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAYOU SORREL, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four pumps were used to empty the remaining oil-tainted water from a disabled, leaking barge Saturday and workers laid out absorbent pads to clean up the impurities that spilled into <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Officials said 10,000 gallons of the non-hazardous waste material _ water with small percentages of oil and alcohol _ spilled into the river early Friday on a loading dock on the river about 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. Earlier estimates had put the amount of the spill at 100,000 gallons or more. `` As of 10 a.m., they were pumping out the barge into vacuum trucks,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wootten </PERSON>, a marine science technician for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. `` They were one behind another. As soon as one is filled, another pulls up.'' The spill occurred when a barge carrying 900,000 gallons of the waste water from an Exxon plant in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> buckled in the middle while workers unloaded the waste into tanker trucks. There were initial fears for the fragile environment _ the site of the spill is near a large marshland area _ and some fish died. But authorities said the spill was quickly contained by booms and the environmental damage would be minimal. `` They have booms in place and only a small amount of the product went down river. It is being retrieved,'' <PERSON> Wootten </PERSON> said. Absorbent pads have been put out to soak up the impurities in the river, officials said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Vice </PERSON>, an employee at <ORGANIZATION> GSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION>, which was being paid to dispose of the waste water, did not have the required <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> certification for performing the work at the time of the accident, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doss </PERSON>. GSX is assuming responsibility for the cleanup, officials said. GSX spokesman <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayweather </PERSON> said Saturday afternoon that Vice was at the site and unavailable for comment. A woman answering the telephone at Vice's home in White Castle also said he was unavailable. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, which has been harshly criticized in the past month because of the 10 million-gallon spill from an oil tanker that hit a reef off <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, had no involvement in Friday's spill except that one of its plants was the source of the waste water, officials said. `` Exxon is getting a bad rap on this,'' <PERSON> Wootten </PERSON> said. `` They had nothing to do with the spill. They had just hired a company to haul the product off. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> should be commended _ they have no liability and they still sent a clean-up crew.'' <PERSON> Wootten </PERSON> said the amount of the so-called `` slop water'' leaking from the barge into the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was very small. `` Drip, drip, drip, that's all it is,'' he said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubois </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the barge, said the water-alcohol mixture is used to wash out tanks and ships. When it's dirty with oil residue, it becomes waste water, he said. Exxon estimated the water contained 3 percent oil and 7 percent alcohol. The alcohol began evaporating after the spill.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s new visa requirement is designed to keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journalists out of the country during the May 7 presidential election. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldo </PERSON> issued a statement claiming the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news media plan to denounce the elections as fraudulent. It said the decision to require visas for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens to visit <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is to prevent a `` disinformation'' campaign and not to hide election fraud. `` The visa requirement is aimed at a strategy of crying fraud to the four winds by representatives of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> press,'' the statement said. It added the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media `` voluntarily or involuntarily, innocently or maliciously, is playing the game of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday that the visa requirement was an `` attempt to isolate the electoral process'' from public scrutiny. Panamanian opposition leaders have invited hundreds of foreign observers to monitor the May voting. They say they fear that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, will fix the vote in favor of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, the officially sanctioned candidate. The opposition alliance seeking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster is supporting <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February 1988 by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that accused the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commander of drug trafficking. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an unsuccessful effort to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to resign and leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The new visa requirement ended 43 years of easy entry into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. Until Friday all they needed was a tourist card. Now they must have a visa issued by a Panamanian consulate that recognizes acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. Most consulates do not recognize <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>. Instead they recognize <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who was ousted by the Noriega-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> when he tried to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug indictments were issued. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as President. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the May 1 issue of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed in February a secret intelligence directive to provide more than $ 10 million in election aid to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s oppoents The magazine attributed its report to unidentified sources and quoted them as saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally lobbied the plan through congressional intelligence committees and won approval for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to provide the money for printing, advertising, transportation and communications to the general's opponents. White House spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said Saturday she could not `` comment on intelligence matters.'' She said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position remains opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but the government does not back any candidates in the Panamanian election. `` Our position remains the same. We want to return democracy to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people,'' she said. `` It's the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people that vote.'' Earlier this month <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> extended the sanctions that include restrictions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies doing business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, holds assets of the Panamanian government in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and prohibits tax payments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organizations to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 AstroTurf, the synthetic sod that makes it possible to play football, baseball and other sports where grass does n't grow, had a 25th birthday party at the private school where it all began. AstroTurf's silver anniversary was observed Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Moses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the Quaker school where the prototype was installed 25 years ago as part of an effort to help city kids become more physically fit. `` We had an idea that it would develop into something big,'' recalled the school's athletic director and football coach, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeoli </PERSON>, who oversaw the installation and was among the 20 to 30 people at Friday's celebration. AstroTurf has been installed in more than 500 locations in 32 countries, said <ORGANIZATION> AstroTurf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milner </PERSON> It wound up at <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> because of a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> study showing urban children were less fit than their suburban counterparts. In 1964, the foundation gave the school a grant to test the artificial grass in its new field house. In developing the turf, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> studied traction, shock absorbance, weather resistance, how balls rolled and bounced, and a host of other factors, <PERSON> Milner </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> used its nylon field for baseball, tennis, soccer and lacrosse, <PERSON> Zeoli </PERSON> said. It also saw service in graduation ceremonies and dances. `` You can clean it so easily, all you need is a vacuum cleaner,'' <PERSON> Zeoli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zeoli </PERSON> figured AstroTurf might have some potential when in 1965 some officials from the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Astrodome journeyed north to have a look at the nylon carpet because they just could n't get real grass to grow in their new domed stadium. The Texans decided on an improved version, and the synthetic turf was subsequently named for the Astrodome. Artificial turf, which costs less to maintain than the natural variety, is used today in most professional football stadiums. AstroTurf is made from a nylon polymer, which is dyed green and spun into a ribbon, then crimped to give it texture and knitted to a tough backing. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s prototype was far different from today's AstroTurf, <PERSON> Zeoli </PERSON> said Its backing was just one-sixteenth of an inch thick, compared to as much as an inch today. `` I could run plays and it was ideal, but I could n't scrimmage,'' <PERSON> Zeoli </PERSON> recalled `` Hitting the surface could probably injure someone.'' Some professional athletes have blamed injuries on AstroTurf, saying the synthetic surface does not give the way natural turf does. However, <ORGANIZATION> AstroTurf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>' magazine, Turf Talk, quotes several doctors as saying the product does not increase the risk of football injuries. <ORGANIZATION> AstroTurf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> was a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> until February 1988, when it was sold to the West German company <ORGANIZATION> Balsam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sportstattenbau </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Steinhagen </PERSON>. The company remains based in <LOCATION> Dalton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. As an anniversary gift, the company resurfaced the weight room at <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> with AstroTurf Its old AstroTurf is still going strong. Three-fourths of the prototype still covers the field house floor.

<HEAD>Pilot AIDS Study A Success, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People responded with surprising frankness to questions about sexual habits and drug use in a pilot study to determine the prevalence of AIDS, suggesting a similar study could succeed nationwide, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health officials say. Of the 308 eligible residents approached in January and February at their homes in <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 263 _ or 85 percent _ agreed to fill out a form containing questions about sexual habits and drug use and to give a blood sample for the study, in exchange for $ 50. `` I'd call it a surprising success,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, project officer for the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which commissioned the survey. The results were discussed Friday at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which approved the pilot study last fall. Still unanswered, researchers said, is whether people participating in a survey are actually telling the truth about their intimate habits, and whether a national survey could be done at close to the original estimated cost of $ 25 million. Besides the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> study, a pilot survey is slated to start this summer in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. One in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, was scrapped in August after community leaders complained it appeared to single out blacks. The pilot studies are running about 20 percent over budget, largely because of the effort required to quell community concern about them, <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, out of an original pool of 450 homes randomly chosen for the survey, interviewers found 308 where a person at home was aged between 18 and 54, the survey's target ages. In all, 263 of the 308 people agreed to fill out a form and give blood. Most residents said they agreed to take part because they wanted to help research into acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Only 15 said the main reason was to get the $ 50 paid to everyone who answered the 22 questions and gave a blood sample. AIDS tests were run on all of the blood samples, but county health officials said they will not release the results. Even survey participants were not given the results of their own blood tests, but those worried about having been exposed to AIDS were advised to contact their doctor or a health clinic.

<TEXT>
 Three Protestant militiamen from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman were arrested in the delivery of missile-launcher parts to a South African diplomat, a government official said Saturday. The French official said the three militiamen belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the largest paramilitary organization in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The arrests were made Friday at a <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> hotel four men were delivering spare parts for the British-made Blowpipe shoulder-carried missile launcher to <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON>, a South African diplomat, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Storm, who is covered by diplomatic immunity, was released but the other four were held for questioning at the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> DST </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s counterespionage agency. There was no official announcement of the arrests. News reports identified the three militiamen as <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, 40; <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, 41; and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 50. The news agency Agence France-Presse identified the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> as 40-year-old <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhart </PERSON>. The agency said without providing details that <PERSON> Bernhart </PERSON> kept an office in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. However, his name was not listed in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> phone book or a local register of companies. French law permits police to hold suspects for questioning for up to four days before they are charged with an offense. A duty officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for the counterespionage agency, said he could not comment on the report. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Saturday that Storm was on the staff of the South African embassy in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and said there would be an investigation of the case. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> newspaper <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> said it appeared the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> hoped to copy the delivered parts to produce a similar anti-aircraft missile of their own, possibly for export. It said the spare parts apparently had been stolen but gave no details. None of the reports carried details of payments for the parts. In <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constablulary </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a dummy Blowpipe missile was stolen over the weekend of April 8-9 from a <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, or national guard, base in <LOCATION> Newtonards </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Down </LOCATION>. He said the security forces insist it had no working parts. There was no known evidence of a link between the discovery and the arrests in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The Blowpipe, sometimes compared to the U.S.-made Stinger missile launcher, weighs about 45 pounds and fires 76mm guided surface-to-air missiles.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> pleaded Saturday with his countrymen to return their money to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, saying capital flight was crippling the economy. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said more than $ 1 billion had left the country in the last nine years, most of it deposited in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. He blamed the capital flight on regional conflicts that plague <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The uncertain panorama of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has badly damaged <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, one of the few nations in the region which lives in democracy and relative tranquility,'' <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said. There are no restrictions on the taking of capital out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is not involved in civil war, but neighbors such as <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are, and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has become a haven for both refugees and guerrillas. <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> said that the `` situation confronting the region provokes fear and insecurity in local and foreign investors.'' `` Because of this more than $ 1 billion has been deposited in foreign bank accounts, specifically in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, by many Hondurans in the last few years,'' he said. He said the majority of Honduran businessmen have bank accounts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000. He spoke in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, one of the main networks in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` If our compatriots would return only 25 percent of this capital, which would be about $ 250 million, it would partially solve the problems that confront <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>,'' the president said. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is ranked by many international organizations as one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere. It suffers 30 percent unemployment, a budget deficit of more than $ 300 million and an inflation rate of 30 percent.

 Twins separated shortly after birth bridged more than 30 years and 2,000 miles Saturday in the culmination of a woman's decade-long search for the sister she never knew. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Muchlenbruch </PERSON>'s efforts paid off last week when she finally located her twin, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McNew </PERSON>, living in a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb. The sisters met for the first time in nearly 35 years Saturday at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` You do n't know how happy we are,'' Ms. <PERSON> Muchlenbruch </PERSON> said, crying and hugging her sister. `` We're going to catch up on all we've lost, all the years we've missed together,'' said a tearful Ms. <PERSON> McNew </PERSON> `` I had a feeling I might have family out there, but I did n't know where.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, of the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Wilmette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, said the congregation would pay for hotel accommodations for the sisters for the weekend so they would n't have to stay in Ms. <PERSON> Muchlenbruch </PERSON>'s trailer home. `` This is probably the biggest thing that has ever happened in -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Muchlenbruch </PERSON>'s -RRB- life,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> McNew </PERSON>'s adoptive mother, <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> McNew </PERSON>, said her daughter was `` kind of a wreck for a whole week'' looking forward to the three-day reunion at her sister's home in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Northfield </LOCATION>. `` She has n't been able to eat, sleep or hardly work,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McNew </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Saturday from <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The twins were born at <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> almost 35 years ago. Shortly afterward, their mother was institutionalized for emotional problems, said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Felt </PERSON>, supervisor of the missing persons service for the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which helped Ms. <PERSON> Muchlenbruch </PERSON> with her search after a decade of futile checking on her own. `` Their father tried to raise them on his own for the first three months, could n't handle it and had to put them up for adoption,'' Ms. Felt said. <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> McNew </PERSON> said she and her husband had wanted to adopt both twins, but the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> adoption agency's policy was to divide twins. `` At that time, they did not want to put twins together ... and they only gave us one,'' she said. `` I thought it was a cruel thing to do.'' For years, Mrs. <PERSON> McNew </PERSON> kept the secret from her daughter. `` Through the years I did n't say anything because I did n't want her frustrated and looking for someone she could n't find,'' she said. When <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> turned 6, her family moved to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` This one was a fluke case,'' said Ms. Felt. `` We did n't have any leads except one, and we ended up sending just one letter.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sent the letter to <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNew </PERSON>, who is divorced with a 14-year-old daughter. `` She waited all of two minutes before curiosity got the best of her and she called her sister,'' Ms. Felt said. `` Every time I talk to them they're crying because they're so happy,'' she said. `` They're so excited they ca n't think straight anymore.''

<TEXT>
 Comic actress <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> continued her smooth recovery from open-heart surgery Saturday, and doctors were considering moving her to another section of the intensive care unit, a hospital spokesman said. `` She's recovering as well as a person can from something like this,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The actress, who remained in serious condition, would stay in the intensive care unit but was doing well enough that she might be moved to an area for patients requiring less critical care, he said. The 77-year-old entertainer underwent emergency surgery Tuesday to receive a transplanted piece of heart artery. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, who has remained popular through decades of reruns of the `` I Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' has been showered with cards, letters and flowers from well-wishers during her recovery.

 Oklahomans on horseback and in wagons Saturday re-enacted the mad rush that occurred a century ago when 2 million acres of Indian territory were opened to white settlement. Thousands watched as history buff <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> fired a Colt pistol and 150 yelling participants in costume rushed forward. With cowboy hats and other gear flying, they raced a half-mile, where the winners were awarded stakes like those their ancestors might have used to claim land in 1889. A few yards into the race, a woman was thrown from her horse. She was taken away by ambulance, but emergency officials said they did n't believe her injuries were serious. The re-enactment, a parade and the issuing of a commemorative postcard were among hundreds of activities marking the 100th anniversary of the land run, which was the first step in the process that led to the creation of the state of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> in 1907. At noon on April 22, 1889, more than 40,000 settlers raced from the borders of the 2 million-acre Unassigned Lands _ present-day central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> territory _ to claim 160-acre tracts or town lots. The land had been opened to white settlement by President <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. Many Oklahomans trace their roots to that race for land, and the centennial has been a focus of celebrations statewide. Some Indian groups are participating; others have protested the festivities. `` We're in the ghetto while the people who stole our land are enjoying prosperity,'' said <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, a member of the Tribal Voices coalition. She said asking Indians to take part is like `` asking us to dance on the graves of our people.'' Many of the events took place in <LOCATION> Guthrie </LOCATION>, the old territorial capital, and traffic on Interstate 35 into town was backed up for about 10 miles Saturday afternoon. On the steps in front of <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s Carnegie library, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service issued the commemorative postcard as Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>, wearing a cowboy hat and a Western-style jacket, and other dignitaries looked on. Speeches on the library steps delayed the start of the parade past its scheduled noon start. Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weems </PERSON> got 65 floats and 18 marching bands rolling around 12:15 p.m., drawing cheers from a crowd estimated at 50,000 as he said, `` We've waited 100 years for this, so let's start this sucker.'' Most of the settlers who flocked here in 1889 were immigrants, former Civil War soldiers, blacks and farmers fleeing drought. They also were opportunists, speculators and profiteers. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> author <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoig </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who has written 10 books on <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> history, said the land run proved to be unfair. At the time, many called the unprecedented event `` <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> Race.'' For some, the race was not to the swift but to the sneaky. The `` Sooners'' who got in sooner than everyone else and gave the state its nickname evaded federal troops guarding the area's borders and claimed choice parcels. Disputes over Sooner claims snarled the courts for years. Those who staked claims for homesteads faced five years of hard work to `` prove up'' their land and gain permanent ownership. Many lived in houses constructed of sod cut from thickly matted soil that had never felt a plow. Some gave up their claims only to try again at later land openings in the Indian territory _ four more via runs, others by lottery, allotment and sealed bids. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, swelled by settlers staking their claims, became the territorial capital and was the state capital before <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> took its place in 1910.

<HEAD>Judge Investigating Exchange Fraud Bars Two Ex-Ministers From Leaving
Country</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge investigating allegations of foreign-exchange fraud has issued an order barring two former finance ministers from leaving the country, newspapers reported Saturday. Congressman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tablante </PERSON>, whose accusations brought about the investigation, has said the case involves overbilling and grants for dollars for non-existent imports that could amount to more than $ 4 billion. The alleged fraud occurred during the administration of President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, when there was a preferential dollar exchange system. That system was abolished shortly after the Feb. 2 inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, also a Social Democrat, who succeeded <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>. The preferential plan pegged the exchange at 14.50 bolivars per dollar for some imports and foreign debt payments. When it was eliminated, it left only the free market rate that ranged around 36 bolivars per dollar last month. Judge <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Riva </PERSON>'s order issued Friday banned ex-finance ministers <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Azpurua </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> from leaving <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Also named in the prohibition order were former vice finance minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>; <PERSON> Egdalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bastardo </PERSON>, who had been the director of Recadi, and an unspecified number of other people who the judge did not identify. <PERSON> Recadi </PERSON> was the government agency, since abolished, that for six years was in charge of granting the preferential exchange for imports. Investigations by both <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Riva </PERSON> and a congressional committee are centered on Recadi. <PERSON> Azpurua </PERSON> was finance minister during the first three years of <PERSON> Lusinchi </PERSON>'s five-year administration. He was replaced by <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, who had previously served as minister of development.

 A goldfish was reunited with its owner Saturday after a week few goldfish can claim to have survived. The six-inch red fantail suffered a close brush with death a week ago when it fell from a motorcycle rider's knapsack onto a busy highway, but was rescued by a passing motorist and resuscitated at a nearby garage. <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Warley </PERSON>, who was traveling in the opposite direction from the motorcyclist, saw the newly purchased fish in its plastic bag of water pop onto the <LOCATION> Scalby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> in this seaside town on the northeast coast of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Warley </PERSON>, 43, asked her husband to stop their car and ran back along the road as cars drove over the bag and burst it, leaving the goldfish high and dry. The fish slithered into the gutter and was gasping its last when Mrs. <PERSON> Warley </PERSON> scooped it up in her hands, sprinted to a nearby garage and plunged it into water from a watering can. Then the <PERSON> Warleys </PERSON> took it home to share a tank with their own goldfish. `` When I picked him out of the gutter he looked in a state of shock,'' the good Samaritan said. `` No wonder _ talk about the one that got away, he must have more lives than a cat.'' The story of the rescue appeared in a local newspaper and a pet shop owner recognized the fish he had sold. By a stroke of luck, the purchaser had left his name and address at the shop earlier when he bought a puppy there. So after a week few of its peers would envy, the lucky red fantail was safely handed over to his owner.

<TEXT>
 The governor on Saturday asked Alaskans to observe five minutes of silence Sunday in remembrance of the way things were before the Exxon Valdez oil spill fouled hundreds of miles of pristine coastline. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and hundreds of volunteers, meanwhile, scrubbed tar-like oil from beaches. Vice Admiral <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s on-scene coordinator, said the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juneau </ORGANIZATION> and USS Fort McHenry would join the effort as floating hotels. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- asked me for them, subject to finding out what the price is. I suspect they'll use them,'' said <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, adding that he had been told the ships cost the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government $ 150,000 a day to operate. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has asked to pay only the amount exceeding the government's cost of operating the landing ships, which are both based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said. The cost issue will be settled at the `` highest levels'' of government, he said. The <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, due in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> on Monday, can sleep 840 troops. The Fort <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> can sleep 500. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> set the period of silence to mark the 30-day anniversary of the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. The fully loaded tanker struck a reef and spilled 10.1 million gallons of crude into wildlife-rich Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. In <PERSON> Cordova </PERSON>, a fishing community 40 miles from the accident, organizers planned an afternoon of activities, including speeches, displays of photographs and a children's mural depicting the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s worst oil spill. `` We wanted the world to know how much we loved Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, how beautiful we think it is,'' said <PERSON> Belle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON>, who coordinates commercial fisheries education programs at <ORGANIZATION> Cordova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Maybe people will understand why we're so sad. ... Seeing whales three feet away ... bears and fish swimming upstream'' are experiences threatened by the spill, she said. Many fisherman have expressed frustration with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> over the lack of progress since the March 24 accident. They have been scooping oil with buckets. A makeshift fleet of 48 skimmer boats returned to their work shortly after daylight Saturday. The oil is being taken to one of five barges hired by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to receive the recovered oil, which will be reprocessed by the company. Low clouds and fog grounded observation and supply planes early Saturday. The cleanup concentrated on sites where seals haul themselves out of the water. Exxon spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said 303,000 feet of boom had been deployed to keep the 14 percent of the spill still at sea from coating beaches. Less than a half-mile of beaches have been cleaned, while the spill has touched beaches along more than 300 miles of the <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the latter home to many brown bears and the world's No. 1 fishing port. <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said that by midday Saturday the 425-foot Soviet skimmer <PERSON> Vaidogubsky </PERSON> picked up about 10,000 gallons of oil at <LOCATION> Gore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, the site of large pools of oil trapped by spectacular rock outcroppings. The vessel arrived Wednesday but spent days testing its booms and refueling. As of Saturday morning it had yet to scoop up any oil. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> policymakers worried that the state's image has been at least as sullied as the spectacular shoreline. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to pay for a program to inspect Alsaska seafood and certify its purity to ease consumer fears. `` There's indications of a fall-off in demand for <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> products,'' the Republican said. `` It's the largest problem I've seen so far, and it could be overwhelming if not addressed. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., toured oil-tainted shores with <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and said Friday they will introduce legislation to make one person _ probably the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant _ responsible for spill cleanups

 Agriculture ministers in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> agreed Saturday to freeze most farm prices within its 12 nations to keep the farm budget at $ 33 billion. After a weeklong debate, the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers agreed to keep price supports generally at last year's levels. The biggest cut will be made in guarantees to growers of citrus fruits, down 7.5 percent.

A tax on the production of surplus milk will be reduced by 25 percent, a move that milk producers had supported.

 About 200 firefighters contained most of a brush fire Saturday that forced the evacuation of 200 homes when it erupted the day before. Firefighters hampered by rough terrain completed 3 -LCB- miles, or 70 percent, of the five miles of fire line needed to contain the blaze, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>, a fire information officer with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. No further evacuations were expected. `` We still have some concerns about some of the subdivisions in the immediate area of the fire,'' <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> said. The blaze flared up southwest of Monument around noon Friday. By midafternoon, it could be seen miles away as it consumed grass, scrub oak and ponderosa pine on private land and land in the <LOCATION> Pike </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. Authorities ordered the evacuation of four subdivisions containing 200 homes, but allowed people back into their homes Friday night. The fire's cause was unknown, <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> said. `` This is an early fire for us,'' he said. `` It's a symptom of the dry weather we've had for the last several years. We do n't normally expect these conditions until maybe June or July. Higher-than-expected humidity and low winds helped firefighters Saturday, <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> said.

 Sailors aboard the USS Wisconsin, sister ship to the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> where 47 men were killed last week in a gun turret explosion, opened their ship Saturday to talk about their pride in battleships and sense of loss. `` The one thing on our mind is the tragic loss of many of our ex-shipmates,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blesch </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. With only four battleships in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, many aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> once served on the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. `` These are all old ships,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, who commands the three 16-inch guns of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s turret No. 3. `` The crews have a connection with all the old sailors who served on the same ships back in World War II. ... They do the same jobs, they face the same dangers.'' An explosion ripped through the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s No. 2 turret Wednesday during gunnery exercises off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The cause of the blast was under investigation. The gun's 2,700-pound projectile is fired by six 110-pound bags of black powder. At the time of the explosion, there were 58 men in the turret, which extends six decks into the 887-foot ship. The 11 who survived were all in the lowest deck, loading powder from the ship's forward magazines, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> teams that entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2 gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still sitting there, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Sunday editions. This indicated that the explosion occurred as the six bags were being loaded into the gun and before it was ready to fire, the Times said, quoting unidentified sources who have seen initial reports on the disaster. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> gunnery officers have further narrowed their estimate of the time of the explosion to the point when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said. They said the flame and gases released by the explosion, which killed everyone in the upper part of the turret, also went down the powder hoist to the lowest deck. The officers said that if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete, the hoist also would have been sealed off. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Saturday he had no new information on the investigation. The ship is expected to arrive at its home port here on Sunday and a base memorial service is scheduled for Monday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Aboard the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sailor was undaunted. `` To me, this is the gunner's ultimate dream,'' said Gunner's Mate 1st Class <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, pointing into the gun room filled with the immense breech of the 16-inch gun `` There is a big boom, rattle and shake when it goes off. I just like hearing them go off. It's the ultimate experience. Little guns go bang. The big ones boom,'' said the 29-year-old Corpus Christi native. In the turret, conditions are cramped and the equipment old. Maintenance, said the crew, is a daily ritual. `` One of the things about these guns is the pride they instill,'' <PERSON> Schatzle </PERSON> said. `` Everything in the gun room is mechanical; there are no computers. The men actually do things. They can take apart the equipment like a car. They get dirty. It's a hands-on job, and it's something that the gunners are proud of ... It's a team and team effort.'' `` It has brought home the fact that it is a dangerous occupation and that things can go wrong and will go wrong in the future,'' <PERSON> Blesch </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> native, he compared gun duty to coal mining, where cave-ins and injuries occur. Critics have argued that the battleships are too old _ especially the 16-inch guns _ to be effective, something <PERSON> Blesch </PERSON> disputed. `` These are magnificent ships. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> withstood the turret blast and today is steaming to port, essentially battle ready. What other ship could?'' he asked.

The students conducting a so-called `` study-in'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Helen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> did not respond to the request, which was the first made by the university, said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> State </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Foss </PERSON>. Later that night, school officials met with the students. As many as 100 students initially occupied the building April 12, but only 40 or 50 were there Saturday night, said a campus policeman who refused to give his name. <PERSON> Foss </PERSON> said the request was part of what the university called its `` last, best offer'' in several days of negotiations with the students. The proposal included an offer of amnesty that would stay in effect until Saturday night's session was concluded. University officials, however, had no plans to ask campus or <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> police to remove the students, <PERSON> Foss </PERSON> said. The university has agreed to 13 of the students' 17 demands, including granting department status to the Center for Black Studies. <PERSON> Administators </PERSON> said they would ask the Board of Governors to establish the department by September. Saturday night's meeting was held to address the four unresolved demands: increased recruitment of black students, reinstatement of money cut from the black studies center's budget over the past 10 years, increased financial aid for blacks and more black faculty. The occupied building contains offices that handle financial aid, registration, student records and other student services.

 Public library officials seeking ways to meet a budget crunch did n't have to look further than their basement, where they found an authentic copy of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s Emancipation Proclamation hidden in a junk pile Trustees of <LOCATION> Ashfield </LOCATION>'s small public library were meeting in the basement worrying over whether state and federal grants would come through when they stumbled across the copy, said trustee <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Isserman </PERSON>, a professor of history at <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holyoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hadley </LOCATION>. `` Somebody said we could sell those old prints over there in the corner,'' he said. `` I walked over and looked at one and it was n't a print, it was a document and I looked down at the bottom and there was <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s signature `` I took it to a local appraiser who introduced me to the world of Lincolnia sales.

 Thousands of gallons of water flooded a control room at the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, knocking out pumps that help cool the reactor, a <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Saturday. The plant had been shut down for about three weeks for refueling and maintenance when the accident occurred shortly after midnight Wednesday, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetto </PERSON>, spokesman for plant owner <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION>. The reactor core's temperature never exceeded 95 degrees, there were no injuries and the pumps were working again within 10 minutes of the accident, <PERSON> Benedetto </PERSON> said. A federal investigative team arrived Friday to look into the accident, said <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON>. According to <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON>, a maintenance crew had been fixing a 6-inch water pipe in the plant's auxiliary building, which houses pumps and control centers. Workers used seals to block water to the section the crew was working on, but the seals failed and about 15,000 gallons poured out. The pipe carries water used to cool various plant equipment, but not the reactor itself, <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON> said. The water that spilled was not radioactive. However, the flood shorted out electrical equipment running the pumps that cool the reactor and powering lights in several parts of the plant, <PERSON> Benedetto </PERSON> said. He said the work that caused the spill would not have been performed if the reactor had been operating. The inspection team's report should be completed in about three weeks, about the same amount of time <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION> is to remain shut down, <PERSON> Gilliland </PERSON> said. River Bend is about 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, and has been in operation since 1985.

 An Australian scientist has charged an influential Indian scholar faked the fossil history of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and the Himalayas in what he called one of biggest paleontological frauds of all time. `` It's a massive fabric of disinformation liberally poured into a 25-year period without anyone blowing the whistle,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Talent </PERSON>, an associate professor in earth sciences at <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Macquarie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Talent accused prominent Indian geologist <PERSON> Viswa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jit </PERSON> <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> of building his career on a `` warped, twisted, tangled'' web of disinformation. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, a geologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Panjab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, was quoted in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> Sunday as saying Talent was lying about him. He said Talent's charges were `` far from the truth'' and the product of `` malicious bias and professional jealousy.'' Talent, in an interview Thursday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> had invented fictitious fossils and had rewritten the geological history of northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> based his writings on specimens `` that could be bought in fossil shops, and were often picked up in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, parts of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and elsewhere.'' He said <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> had reported discovering a `` huge number'' of fossils in remote areas of the Himalayas, which because of the high mountain range is accessible to few scientists. He contended that most of the specimens were `` common laboratory rocks.'' Talent's findings were published Thursday in the respected British journal Nature. Talent said <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> had published about 400 scientific papers and several major texts on the geology of the Indian Subcontinent. He said academics from around the world had collaborated on the papers, which were readily accepted by leading international journals. The <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, in an earlier interview, said Talent estimated that about 60 scientists had `` unwittingly been drawn into the fraud by agreeing to examine specimens and co-author papers.'' Talent said he first became suspicious of <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>'s research in 1971 because of a research paper on tiny marine fossils called graptolites, which he reported came from a site in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>. After visiting the site, Talent said, he discovered `` to my amazement, you could never find graptolites or any kind of fossils there because the site was so mashed up.'' `` I became intrigued at the results that <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> was putting into the literature,'' he said. `` I intially believed that the fraud would collapse under its own weight. `` It reached a point that there was so much misinformation that it was getting difficult to place our own work and that of our colleagues in context.'' <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> told the Times he had invited Talent to visit his laboratory in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> and the fossil sites that were in dispute, but Talent declined. Talent told the newspaper he had not been able to fit such visits into his schedule, and was calling for an investigation by a panel of scientists.

<TEXT>
 About 200 people, including seriously ill patients who said medical research with animals had saved their lives, rallied Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in support of such research. The rally by students, faculty members and pro-research demonstrators came after a rash of protests and death threats against biomedical researchers at the university in this suburb north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. University President <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> told demonstrators the university would not be intimidated by recent acts of vandalism against university buildings, including spray-painted death threats against faculty members. Animal rights groups have denied any connection with the threats and vandalism. Seriously ill demonstrators said research using animals is their only only hope for a cure, and claimed that foes are jeopardizing medical progress. `` We need to look at the human side of it, and realize what would happen if animal rights activists got their way,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, national executive director of the Incurably Ill for <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a group he said has 2,500 members nationwide. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, 37, was severely burned over 50 percent of his body in an airplane accident and suffers from chronic osteomyelitis, a painful bone infection he said can be treated thanks to tests on animals. `` I am a person whose life was saved by animal research,'' he said. `` There's no way I can express how grateful I am this research was done. `` Painkillers that allowed me to keep my sanity were developed on animals,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. `` We would n't have coronary bypass surgery, be able to remove cateracts, or have joint implants for arthritis victims'' without the research. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> was joined by about a dozen other patients who have illnesses for which there is not yet a cure, including diabetics, cancer survivors and two children with congenital heart defects. Two parents also spoke at the rally, contending that their children would not be alive if it were n't for medical progress made through animal testing. A member of <ORGANIZATION> Concerned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a group opposed to animal testing, said he was outraged by what he called a distortion of the issue. `` They paint a picture trying to say that animal rights activists are hurting medical progress,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` Just because something has been done in the past, or is legal, does n't mean that it's right. The Concerned Citizens group has targeted five scientists in recent weeks, pressuring them to discontinue their research. The group contends Northwestern researchers starve monkeys and stick electrodes and needles in cats' eyes. Researchers counter that the animals are anesthetized and feel no pain.

<TEXT>
 In a fiscal ruse that authorities hoped would help them track <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>, police persuaded <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to extend unlimited credit to the accused mass killer. The automatic teller machines effectively were deputized to help catch the man accused of killing his wife, two of his daughters, his mother-in-law and her two daughters, and a winery co-worker. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where he was captured and deported back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> late Thursday. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> was reported to have run out of bank funds last week while on a cocaine-and-alcohol binge that friends said preceded the slaughter. The <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office arranged with the bank to track <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> through any transactions he made with his automatic teller -LRB- ATM -RRB- card and instructed bank tellers that his credit line was wide open, Sheriff <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoogerwef </PERSON> said the bank gladly cooperated with authorities, adding that <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> tried to use an automatic teller card at least once at a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> on Friday at 9:24 a.m., and possibly again later in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> while heading for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Investigators said the killings occurred that day between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> also bought some clothes with his bank card at the <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Less </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rafael </LOCATION> Friday morning. `` The debate was -LRB- whether or not -RRB- you give him open credit. ... We were worried about the safety of our tellers.'' said <PERSON> Hoogerwef </PERSON>. `` We did not want to do anything to set him off,'' agreed <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfro </PERSON>, the bank's security manager. <PERSON> Renfro </PERSON> said as word of the crimes spread, it became more credible that <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON> would not chance going into a bank where he might be recognized and would try to use the ATM to get cash. <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON> said with the bank's cooperation, the department was able to bypass a court request for permission to tap in to <PERSON> Salcido </PERSON>'s account. The sheriff said the bank cooperated because they were in `` hot pursuit'' and `` lives were in danger.'' `` I am very proud. I think we did an excellent job,'' said <PERSON> Michaelsen </PERSON>. `` It was excellent police work. It -LRB- his arrest -RRB- was not just a fluke.''

<HEAD>Northwest Pilots Urged to Settle to Attract `Friendly' Takeover Bid</HEAD>

 Friendly investors could help <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> defend itself from a hostile takeover bid if the carrier's 5,000 pilots quickly agree to a contract, according to a management letter made public Friday `` Frankly, there are alternatives available to us from friendly investors,'' Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said in the letter, which was sent to pilots of the nation's fourth-largest airline on Thursday. `` The absence of a pilot contract keeps the patient money away,'' the letter said. `` But it does nothing to scare away the highly leveraged money from those investors who do n't really care because if they ca n't make the airline work, they just break it up.'' The letter was released to the media after stock in <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 102.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up $ 3.75 from Thursday's close. The stock price reflects a belief on Wall Street that there will be a bid higher than billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' current $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90-a-share, hostile tender offer. Calls to the Twin Cities headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> went unanswered Friday night. Pilots have been working under two separate contracts since <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in the fall of 1986. One of the key sticking points in negotiations is merging the airlines' seniority lists. Both contracts have expired. `` We are prepared and willing to negotiate around the clock to reach an agreement,'' <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> wrote. `` We are in a fluid situation that can change, quite literally, from hour to hour.'' According to testimony in a lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> against <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, representatives for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> have been in contact with labor leaders at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, including the pilots union. A judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> from `` disrupting'' the contract talks, but the order does not forbid `` nondisruptive'' communication. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> aides have said they want to establish an `` open dialogue'' with the pilots. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> himself has said he does not intend to break up the airline by selling strategic assets to pay takeover debt.

 The first half of fiscal 1989 ended with a budget deficit that is running 7.4 percent ahead of last year's, according to the government's latest report on its financial situation. For the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the budget deficit totaled $ 128.43 billion, up from the $ 119.61 billion shortfall posted in the first six months of last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is estimating this year's deficit will total $ 163.3 billion, up 5.3 percent from the $ 155.1 billion shortfall posted in for all of fiscal 1988. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, this year's deficit was not supposed to exceed $ 146 billion. The administration and congressional leaders last week unveiled a compromise plan designed to reduce the deficit in the next fiscal year to $ 99.4 billion, just within the $ 100 billion target for fiscal 1990 established under Gramm-Rudman.

But the study, prepared jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was laying the groundwork for his proposed 14.2 percent cut in defense spending The study said chopping military spending so sharply would require the Soviets to reduce their armed forces by more than the 500,000-troop reduction announced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December, meaning further cutbacks in the Soviet military. The newly declassified report painted a grim overall picture of the Soviet economy. It said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been forced to slow the pace of his economic reforms and to delay such key steps as allowing the market to set wholesale and retail prices.

 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION>, for more than a century one of the toughest places in the nation to do time, has been emptied of virtually all its most hardened criminals.

 Many company bosses duck investor salvos at annual meetings, but <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> likely will bask in shareholder adulation because he's enriched them for the 24th year. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, one of the world's wealthiest people, is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 6 billion conglomerate with interests that include an encyclopedia, a homespun candy maker, an <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> furniture mart, a giant insurance company and investments in <ORGANIZATION> Coca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, among others. Folksy, charming and unconventional, the 57-year-old investor wows shareholders and stock analysts with a pithy annual report he writes himself, filled with insights into what he considers good and bad in his business and the economy in general. It's earned him the nickname, `` Oracle of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>.'' This year, <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> began the report with a 21-page letter to shareholders, telling them the stock market is lousy, corporate taxes are higher and the takeover business is getting expensive. Nonetheless, he wrote, <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION>'s management team gained $ 569 million in net worth for them in 1988, contributing to an average net worth gain of 23 percent over the last 24 years. He also proclaimed <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> had made a great investment in <ORGANIZATION> Borsheim </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a flourishing <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> jewelry business. `` We continue to concentrate our investments in a very few companies that we try to understand well,'' <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> wrote. `` There are only a handful of businesses about which we have strong long-term convictions. Therefore, when we find such a business, we want to participate in a meaningful way. We agree with Mae West: ` Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.''' <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>'s report is a prelude to <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, which he's holding Monday in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, the company's headquarters He plans to make shareholders feel like they're at a family reunion. `` After the meeting we will have several buses available to take you to visit Mrs. B at the <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Furniture Mart and <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Borsheim </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> wrote to the shareholders. `` Be prepared for bargains.'' The biggest bargain <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> shareholders ever got was buying the company's stock, which had a book value of about $ 20 a share in the mid 1960s, when <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> acquired what was then <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> cloth milling concern with $ 10 million in assets. Now its book value is nearly $ 3,000 a share and it trades on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at nearly $ 5,900 a share. <PERSON> Berkshire </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> is considered such a gem that takeover strategist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> ranked it last month as among the top 20 of 1,000 big companies for what he called its commitment to shareholders. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>'s annual report is so widely followed that <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> said recently it `` runs a good chance of being the only one anyone actually reads on or off Wall Street.'' <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Berkshire </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>'s chief financial officer, said the company is besieged with requests for the annual report and shareholders flock like pilgrims to the annual meeting. `` People travel here from the far reaches of the country and the world,'' he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a professional annual report publishing concern, gave high marks to <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>'s yearly prognostications to shareholders, largely because it showed he was honest and direct with fellow owners of the company. `` <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> is one of the four or five richest men in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` When he speaks, people listen. He uses his report to say what he wants to say. He uses the report to underscore his own investment principles and the keys to his success.'' Nonetheless, <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON> is not universally admired. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Cato </PERSON>, publisher of a monthly newsletter on annual reports based in <LOCATION> Waukesha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, ranked <ORGANIZATION> Berkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION>'s as one of the 10 worst last year, largely because of what he called <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>'s inflated ego. `` I wrote, ` Mr. <PERSON> Buffett </PERSON>, you're starting to get on my nerves already, enough already,'' <PERSON> Cato </PERSON> said. Asked if he'd seen this year's annual report, <PERSON> Cato </PERSON> said, `` No, he has not seen fit to send me a copy.''
